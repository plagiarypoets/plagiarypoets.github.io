Glorious as Phoebus, o'er the wide sea first
Pouring his morning beams, celestial bright,
Is the quick hope of the young bosom, nurst
Within the bowers of knowledge and of light,&mdash;
Where, bursting brilliant from the gloom of night,
The sun of mind expands the opening soul
Just as the natural orb, that glads the sight,
Opens the buds of plants, and o'er the whole
Of God's fair world maintains a mystery of control.

Full sweet it is to watch the kindling eye,
The burning cheek, the quivering lip of youth,
When Genius pointeth to the summit high
Where FAME sits glorious, and recording Truth
Enrolls the deathless names! &mdash; for names, in sooth,
Survive the beings that made them first renown'd,
And shine resplendent, when Time's cankering tooth&mdash;
Nay, the slow worm's &mdash; hath eaten beneath the ground
The eye that beam'd with light, the brow with laurel crown'd!

Bards, warriors, statesmen &mdash; Glory!  bow the knee
To thy divinity, and ask a name;
And some, in their mistaken love of thee,
Have worshipped Infamy, and called her Fame:
Such was Erostratus, who gave to flame
Diana's shrine stupendous; such was thou,
Cromwell!  consummate juggler!  England's shame!
To whom thy slaves, false Freedom!  deigned to bow,
Circling with thy wreath a rebel tyrant's brow.

Oh, too exalted, vainly-worshipped Fame!
How dost thou trample on the insect man!
He reads, he writes, he battles for a name&mdash;
And yet his own existence is a span.
The world moves onward as it first began,
Thirsting for thee.  As Caesar in old time,
Of late Napoleon at thy bidding ran,
Clearing his path to Glory's heights by crime,
And dreading nought save what might make him less sublime!

Was not Meonides in love with thee?
Didst thou not, with his country, share the heart
Of him who perish'd in Thermopylae?
Did not thy trumpet's fore-heard voice impart
Joy to the stoic Cato, whom no art
Of guileful Tyranny could lure aside?
Did not the Mantuan offer at they mart
His never-dying children, and confide
To thee those breathing words which were his country's pride?

When &mdash; as the sun's last rays were falling sweet
On earth, air, water &mdash; I beheld the spot
Where Shakspeare rose &mdash; where Shakspeare's boyish feet
Oft wandered careless &mdash; how, regarding not
Nature for her own beauty, I forgot
All, all around &mdash; save Shakspeare!  Shakspeare's muse
Hallow'd each willow and sequester'd grot,
And thee, poetic Avon!  while the dews
Of sombre Evening fell on church and church-yard yews.

For thou art there &mdash; about that blessed place&mdash;
Eternal Fame!  and loud above his tomb
Thy trumpet's echo liveth:  light and grace
Are shed by thee o'er that sepulchral gloom:
By thee are tinged the flowerets wild that bloom
O'er the green banks which Avon loves to kiss;
Thine is the halo! &mdash; and the earth's perfume,
But from thy magic influences, is
As't were to Shakspeare's name the scent of sacrifice!
