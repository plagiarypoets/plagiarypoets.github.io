Oh, Greece!  thou fairy land of school-boy hours,
Thou earthly paradise of youthful dreams!
How have I rambled through thy classic bowers,
And hung in fancy o'er thy fabled streams!
And now again the sun of glory gleams
From its pure heaven; and victory's angel smiles,
And all that valour deems immortal, beams
Around thy lovely vales and sunny isles;
And hosts are met again, in thy unstained defiles.

And heroes, as of old, undaunted rise,
Call'd to the battle for thy hearths and fanes;
And banners float in thy unruffled skies,
And warlike music echoes from thy plains,
And swords leap forh at th' inspiring strains:
Who would not rush to combat for thy sake?
When she they love of foreign yoke complains!
Oh, Europe!  may thy valiant spirit wake,
And the oppressor from his grasp of bondage shake!
