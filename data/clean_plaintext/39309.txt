Despairing a table beside,
Squire Winelove forsaken was seen;
In verse thus he 'gan for to chide,
And thus he gave vent to his spleen,
While Popsy and Fancy and Dash,
To his sighs with their snores did reply:
And the deer, while he look'd through the fash,
Mov'd mournfully murmuring by.

Thy fate, silly wretch, how support!
Thus sadly complaining, he cried,
To quit a good bottle of port,
'Twere better by far I had died.
Its blood like a ruby was bright,
When it flow'd, 'twas a pleasure too great,
I toasted and cried all the night,
Not nectar itself was so sweet.

How foolish was I then to think,
When I went unmolested 'twould be,
Or that a good soul would not drink
Of its juices with pleasure and glee?
What made me suppose that my wine
Untouch'd in my parlour would rest;
That no taste would approve it but mine,
And drink it with relish and zest!

What tho' I my tube can apply,
And light it whene'er I desire;
And see its smoke pleasant mount high,
Virginia still finding the fire.
Ah, Winelove, these words are in vain,
Thy pipe and tobacco give o'er;
No drops on the table remain,
Now PINCHEY has lock'd up the door.

And you my companions so dear,
Who sorrow to see me betray'd,
Depriv'd of my bottle and chear,
So spiritless, sad, and dismay'd.
Tho' through the wide world I should range,
'Tis in vain from my fortune to fly,
'Twas Pinchey effected this change,
'Tis mine to be thirsty and dry.

If while my hard fate I deplore,
From his breast all pity's not fled,
Once again let him ope the vault door,
And give me one bumper of red.
The last humble boon that I crave,
Is thus kindly to moisten my clay;
And when he looks down on my grave,
A few tears of old port let him pay.

Then to a new place let him go,
The tea-cups arrange in array,
And please all the women with show,
A footman full gallant and gay;
While Winelove, forgotten and gone,
No longer shall top off his glass,
Unless when beneath the pale moon,
His ghost through the cellar shall pass.
