CLORIN.
Haile holy earth, whose colde armes do embrace
The truest man that ever fed his flockes
By the fat plaines of fruitful Thessaly,
Thus I salute thy grave, thus do I pay
My early vowes and tribute of mine eies,
To thy still loved ashes:  thus I free
My selfe from all ensuing heates and fires
Of love, all sports, delights and games,
That Shepheardes hold full deare thus put I off.
No no more shall these smooth browes be girt,
With youthfull coronals, and lead the dance,
No more the company of fresh faire Maids
And wanton shepheards be to me delightfull.
Nor the shrill pleasing sound of merry pipes,
Under some shady dell, when the coole winde
Plaies on the leaves, all be farre away:
Since thou art farre away:  by whose deare side,
How often have I sat crownd with fresh flowers
For Summers queene, whilst every Shepheards boy
Puts on his lusty greene with gaudy hooke,
And hanging scrippe of finest cordevan:
But thou art gone, and these are gone with thee,
And all are dead but thy deare memorie:
That shall outlive thee, and shall ever spring,
Whilst there are pipes, or Jolly shepheards sing.
