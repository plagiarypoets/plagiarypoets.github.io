RECITATIVE, accompany'd.
Hence!  boast not, ye Profane,
Of vainly fancy'd, little tasted Pleasure,
Pursu'd beyond all measure,
And by its own Excess transform'd to Pain.

AIR.
Come, with native Lustre shine,
Moderation, Grace Divine;
Whom the wise God of Nature gave
Mad Mortals from themselves to save.
Keep, as of old, the Middle-way,
Nor deeply sad, nor idly gay,
But still the same in Look and Gaite,
Easy, chearful, and sedate.

RECITATIVE, accompany'd.
Sweet Temp'rance in thy Right-hand bear,
With her let rosy Health appear;
And in thy Left Contentment true,
Whom headlong Passion never knew.
Frugality, by Bounty's Side,
Fast friends, Tho' oft as Foes bely'd;
Chaste Love, by Reason led secure,
With Joy sincere, and Pleasure pure;
Happy Life, from Heaven descending,
Crowds of smiling Years attending.

CHORUS.
All this Company serene,
Join to fill thy beauteous Train.

AIR.
Come, with gentle Hand restrain
Those who fondly court their Bane;
One Extreme with Caution shunning,
To another blindly running.
Kindly teach, how blest are they
Who Nature's equal Laws obey;
Who safely steer two Rocks between,
And prudent keep the golden Mean.

RECITATIVE.
No more short Life they then will spend,
In straying further from its End;
In frantick Mirth, and childish Play,
In Dance and Revels, Night and Day;
Or else like lifeless Statues seeming,
Ever musing, moping, dreaming.

AIR.
Each Action will derive new Grace,
From Order, Measure, Time, and Place;
'Till Life, the goodly Structure, rise
In due Proportion to the Skies.

L'ALLEGRO AND PENSEROSO.
As steals the Morn upon the Night
And melts the Shades away,
So Truth does Fancy's Charm dissolve,
And rising Reason puts to flight
The Fumes that did the Mind involve,
Restoring intellectual Day.

CHORUS.
Thy Pleasures, Moderation give;
In Them alone we truly live.
