Ah!  what avails, how once appear'd the Fair,
When from gay Equipage she falls obscure;
In vain she moves her livid Lips in Pray'r;
What Man so mean to recollect the Poor?

From Place to Place, by unfee'd Bailiffs drove,
As fainting Fawns from thirsty Blood-hounds fly;
See the sad Remnants of unhallow'd Love,
In Prisons perish, or on Dunghills die.

Pimps and Dependants once her Beauties prais'd;
And on these Beauties, Vermin-like, they fed;
From Wretchedness, the Crew her Bounty rais'd,
When by her Spoils enrich'd &mdash; deny her Bread.

Through Street to Street, she wends, as Want betides,
Like Shore's sad Wife, in Winter's dismal Hours;
The bleak Winds piercing her unnourish'd Sides,
Her houseless Head dripping with drizzly Showers.

Sickly she stroles amidst the miry Lane,
While streaming Spouts dash on her uncloath'd Neck;
By Famine pinch'd; pinch'd by Disease-bred Pain,
Contrition's Portrait, and rash Beauty's Wreck.

She dies; sad Outcast!  Heart broke by Remorse;
Pale stretch'd against th' inhospitable Doors;
While gathering Gossips taunt the fleshless Corse,
And thank their Gods &mdash; that they were never Whores.
