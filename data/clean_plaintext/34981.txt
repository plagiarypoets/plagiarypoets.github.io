SPENSER:
Surely some spright, from Archimago sent,
Has lulled the souls of listless mortal kind,
His subtle drops around th' horizon sprent!
Aye may such verse the willing hearer bind:
Why from such error draw th' enchaunted mind?
Of learned sleepe let nations take their fill;
May no rude chaunticleer his clarion wind,
Lest modern Sybarites should work their will,
That most ungentle Cock eftsoons prepar'd to kill.

How blest those antique times, whose goodly taste
In high-wrought numbers found supreme delight;
Ne would in folly's guise their moments waste;
But rais'd aloft their unconstrained sight,
And Nature view'd in varying colours bright:
In vain with screams funereal hovering round,
Strove cursed birds in dusky plumage dight
To blot day's empire, and deform the ground:
High blaz'd the lordly orb; loud beat the rapturous sound.
