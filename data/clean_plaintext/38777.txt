Swells then thy feeling heart, and streams thine eye
O'er the deserted being, poor and old,
Whom cold, reluctant parish charity
Consigns to mingle with his kindred mould?

Mourn'st thou, that here, the time-worne sufferer ends
Those evil days, that promis'd woes to come,
HERE, where the friendless feel no want of friends,
Where e'en the houseless Wanderer finds a home!

What tho' no kindred crowd in sable forth,
And sigh, or seem to sigh around the bier;
Tho' o'er his coffin, with the humid earth
No children drop the unavailing tear;

Rather, rejoice, that HERE, HIS sorrows cease,
Whom sickness, age, and poverty oppress'd;
Where Death, the Leveller &mdash; restores the peace
The wretch who living knew not where to rest.

Ah!  think, that this poor outcast, spurn'd by fate,
Who a long race of pain and sorrow ran,
Is in the grave, even as the rich and great&mdash;
Death vindicates the insulted Rights of Man.

Rejoice!  that tho' severe his earthly doom,
Tho' rude, and strewn with thorns the path he trod,
Now, where unfeeling fortune cannot come,
He rests upon "the bosom of his God!"
