Behold!  the sun in vivid brightness crown'd
From yonder cloud pours forth the splendid ray;
Th' hurried mists that veil'd th' horizon round,
And wrapt in shades a while the cheerful day;
Before the solar radiance die away:
The opening landscape swells in grandeur bright,
Whose rural scenes unumber'd charms display,
And lend new pleasures to th' enraptur'd sight.
Thus, when religion's mild celestial light,
In Heavenly radiance bland illumes the mind,
Tho' long obscured in error's gloomy night,
Where vice and folly round the soul entwin'd.
Our thoughts extend to brighter scenes anew,
And heav'nly prospects open on our view.
