Praise, bid the Angels, who beside thy throne,
In shining order wait, and, trumpet-tongued
Rehearse the deeds of those
Whom future time shall bless,
Spread their far-sounding wings, and, from the caves
Where Ocean steeps in silv'ry wings, and, from the caves
Of purest, whitest ray,
The chosen jewels cull!&mdash;
With thine own fingers string the glitt'ring gems,
And coil Twelve Crowns &mdash; and then another Twelve,
And on their noble brows
Th' eternal guerdon bind,
Who now, once more, the holy gates unbar
Of FREEDOM'S long-forbidden silent Fane&mdash;
And to loud worship call
Rejoicing BRITAIN'S Sons!
