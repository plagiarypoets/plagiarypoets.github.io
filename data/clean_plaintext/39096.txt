Far from Ambition's selfish train,
Where Avarice rules the busy day,
And patient Folly "hugs his chain,"
Enslav'd by Custom's ruthless sway,
Lead me, calm spirit!  to some still retreat,
Where science shares with thee the blooming mead,
Save when at distance heard, in cadence sweet,
The village minstrel tunes his simple reed.
There, free from cares, from jarring passions free,
Oft may I strike the lyre, sweet Solitude!  to thee.

When orient Morn, in blushing pride,
Profusely sheds the glist'ning dew,
Oft let me climb the mountain's side,
And raptur'd mark the varied view.
When Noon directs on earth his parching ray;
Then let me find the cool, the peaceful shade,
Form'd by embow'ring oaks, in firm array,
O'er some small stream that rustles through the glade.
Thither let Fancy lead her magic band,
And o'er my senses wave her soul-entrancing wand.

But when at eve the curfew's knell
Winds slowly thro' the dusky grove,
Pensive I'll seek the rural cell,
Or 'midst the gloom in silence rove;
And when from village spire the solemn toll
Yields its sad tribute to the breathless clay;
As calm Reflection steals upon my soul,
The tear unmark'd shall take its silent way;
And mounted oft I'll cull the violet's bloom,
Heave the sad soothing sigh, and dress the clay-cold tomb.

When Midnight spreads her blackest robe,
And shrouds in sullen mists the sky;&mdash;
When Terror rules the silent globe,
And phantoms mock the fearful eye;
Parent of all!  whose voice the winds obey,
The raving ocean, and the black'ning storm,
Yet stoop'st to guide the sparrow on his way,
And shed'st thy mercy on the struggling worm!
To thee, great God!  to thee my voice I'll raise;
Trembling I'll strike the lyre, and hymn thy boundless praise.
