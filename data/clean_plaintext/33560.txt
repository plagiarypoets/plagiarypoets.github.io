AMINTAS, ADMETAS.

THE ARGUMENT.
Distrest Amintas sits and mournes,
All proferd joy, and solace scornes,
He tells the story of his woes
Piteous to heare.  Admetas does
His utmost to asswage his griefe,
But Counsell yeelds him no reliefe
Nought will asswage it, to the skies,
He sadly shoots a look, and dies.

ADMETAS.
Amintas wherefore dost thou moane
As if all thy joyes were gone,
Up man, leave this uncouth shade,
This tenebrous and fatall glade,
Where none but Satyrs us'd to prance,
And the nimble Faeries daunce;
See, thy sheep go all astray,
Thy belt and scrip is stol'n away,
Thy pipe lies neere the Brook in twaine,
Chear up, O thou dejected Swaine.

AMINTAS.
Cease (good Admetas) thy harsh din,
And know I suffer for my sin,
Under this broad spreading Beech,
Whose curled front to Heaven doth reach,
I'le lie, and listen to the Owle,
And languishing sigh out my Soule.

ADMETAS.
So to dare thy frowning Fate,
Argues thee madly desperate,
Most loved Shepheard, what may be
The cause of thy great miserie?

AMINTAS.
O Friend, t'will but augment my grief,

ADMETAS.
To breath one woe is some reliefe,
All the Shepheards of the plaine
Mourn for thee delicious Swaine,
They sorrow that thy Pipe is still,
Which came so near to Astrophill,
Yea, wont aswell to please the route,
As the rare Layes of Collin Clout:
Their Oaten Reeds they also break,
And make great sorrow for thy sake.

AMINTAS.
May they be happy, I am lost,
Split when I hope to harbour most,
I feell the frozen hand of death,
But yet before I yeeld my Breath,
Ile tell thee (dear Friend) ere thou goe,
The cause and progresse of my woe.

ADMETAS.
Here Il'e lie down, proceed to tell,

AMINTAS.
Admetas hear and mark mee well,
Thou knewst faire Cloris, lovely faire,
Who tyed wing'd Cupid in her haire,
The little god being glad to stay,
Did with his golden fetters play,
Lovely as Hebe, fairer farre
Then she the plumpe god made a starre;
As coldly chaste as ere was shee,
Titan turnd to Lawrell tree,
Wise as Tritonia, her bright eyes,
Dazl'd Apollo in his rise,
Her forehead cheerefull, corrall lip'd,
Her cheekes were Roses in milk dipt,
Fingers such as Aurora faire
When pleating her old Tythons haire,
This goddesse of my life and I
(Joynd in mutuall amities)
By Hymen to the Temple led,
Dame Flora having deck'd our bed,
To add unto our active sports
Fortune who still our wishes thwarts
Joyning with Atropos, conspired,
To kill the thing I so desired,
Chloris in the Temple dies,
Her Nuptialls are her Obsequies.

ADMETAS.
Most gentle Shepheard I confesse,
Thou hast great cause of heavinesse,
But wise men have concluded still
Tis vaine to waile and helplesse ill.

AMINTAS.
Her memory remaines with me,
Although her body buried be,
Ye purling brooks, who murmuring
Still run on errands to your King,
Earth-shaking Neptune, bid him rore
Untill he do eat up the shore,
And let his Tritons loud resound
The cause, and dolour of my wound,
Both Death, and Destinie, and Hell,
Avernus, where the Furies dwell,
With the loathsome stream of Stix,
In their Counsels do commix
For to rob me of my Blisse,
Staying my Love in shadie Dis.

ADMETAS.
What frenzie doth possess thy brain,
O thou late most honoured Swaine?
But Love I know no Law abides,
Since his great power, Heaven guides,
And all things that on earth survive,
Without they love they never thrive.
"Love altereth nature, ruleth Reason,
Makes vice a Virtue, Virtue Treason."
Jove, whose voice Olympus shakes,
Love, to be transformed makes.
Love caus'd Hypollitus with briers
(Shunning Phaedras lustfull fires)
To be out of his Chariot born,
And into many peices torn.
Love layd Absyrtus limbs o'th Strand,
Scattered by his Sisters hand,
Forc'd Pasiphae (that impious trull)
To the embraces of a Bull.
Love great Alcides did betray,
And while upon Polixena
Achilles doated, he was slaine,
(Rhamnusia so her will did gaine.)
Love, smooth Leander did compell
To swim the Helespont so well.
No marvell then that thou art tane
(Admintas) thus unto thy bane,
These were with living beauties fir'd
By thee a dead Maid is desir'd.

AMINTAS.
Admetas, cease t' upbraid my will,
'Lesse thou hast Podalyrius skill,
And with thy oyntments canst asswage
The fire that in my heart doth rage,
In direfull sobbing, sighs and teares,
Perpetuall plaints Il'e spend my years,
On Rocks, in Dens, and deserts I
Will breath my woes incessantly,
Farewell for ever, my deare Flocks,
Ye Woods, ye Rivers, and ye Rocks,
A black stone ever on this day,
Let each true Lover cast away;
On which let Titan never shine,
But let the clustering clouds combine
For to obscure the sight of day,
And dim the glories of his ray,
Let loathsome snakes loud hissing keep,
And scaly fishes leave the deep,
To come on shore, let scritch-owles sing
Myrtles wither, Willowes spring;
Dearest Chloris, see I come
To meet thee in Elizium.
