A paultry, creeping ivy had,
By length of time, an oak o'erspread;
Twisting, and tangling every arm,
Still boasting, that it did no harm:
Since, by his aid and strength alone,
The oak's secur'd from falling down.

Now, list'ning to this creature vain,
One thus replies, in pure disdain:

Thou, little, sneaking, scrubby weed!
Thou, nothing but thyself dost heed:
If suffer'd, thou, this noble trunk
Wilt quite suck dry, like any punk.
Then soon, his helping hand he gave,
And stript it off, the tree to save.

MORAL.
Thus saves the prince, who stands surrounded
With cheats, and pilferers confounded;
Till he, at once resumes his power,
And turns the villains o'er and o'er.
