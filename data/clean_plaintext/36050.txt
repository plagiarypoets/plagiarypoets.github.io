The fragrant wind that sweeps the groves,
And gently stirs the summer sea,
To other ladies brings their loves,
With shout, and song, and revelry,
And joy, and pomp, and warlike glee.
Go, climb the rock where sea-gulls lave
Their snowy-plumes, my page, and see
If through the Solway's murmuring wave
The vessels sweep which bring the brave.

Forth flew the page, as eaglet flies,
To the smooth lake where cygnets breed,
When back he came with beaming eyes,
And faltering tongue, and breathless speed.
"Oh!  brede your locks and trim your weed,
Wear heart and soul upon your tongue,
The sea is bright with banners spread,
And cavern'd glen and cliff along
Ring to the soldier's homeward song."

O'er-mantled with her snowy veil,
She started forth, while, thickening near,
The breeze stretch'd many a milk-white sail;
And dames from cliff and mainland drear,
Flung seaward many a shout and cheer.
With warlike forms flash'd stern and prow,
Full many a lady hail'd her dear;
And many a fair cheek, wet with woe,
Wax'd faint, no kindred tongue to know.

'Mid captur'd banners, streaming bright,
And laurell'd eaglets, sparkling gold,
Her warlike husband bless'd her sight;
Beside him, minstrel hoar and old,
Class'd him with kings and heroes bold.
All trembling with delight, she flew;
No alter'd main, no aspect cold
She met; but eyes all bright with dew,
And throbbing breast and rapture true.

She clasp'd and gaz'd him o'er and o'er;
Unharm'd, he smil'd, by wound or scar.
"Now this, she cried, is blyther hour
Than when mild July's bridal star
Illum'd thy path to softer war."
He kiss'd and bless'd his sobbing dame&mdash;
"An my sweet lady's lovelier far,
Than when, all flush'd with maiden shame,
Unto her bridegroom's arms she came."
