Is then the fairy dream for ever clos'd?
And the pomp gone on which my soul repos'd?
Alas!  the hated hiss I'm doom'd to hear,
Derides the power it once was forc'd to fear;
A hundred tongues united joyful roar
"P&mdash;ll&mdash;ps, that God, is Proctor now no more."
Farewell the grand ideas the mind receives
From the black Majesty of velvet sleeves:
Farewell the ermin'd hood, my Sunday pride;
Farewell the task for various use apply'd:
Farewell the streets I walk'd, elate with pow'r,
Seeking, like Satan, whom I might devour.
Farewell my liveried Slaves, that walk'd behind,
In white-brown cloaks that flutter'd in the wind.
Farewell the lore I practic'd with delight;
The useful lore of pow'r implying right:
Now haughty wh-res my steps untrembling meet;
And snap their scornful fingers in the street.
No more the Raphs avoid me as I come,
Tho' once they trembled at my "fe, fa, fum:"
The social band no more my jokes admire;
Hand me my glass, and place me by the fire.
No more the wonder of the Common Room&mdash;
The Rose becomes a Thorn when lost its bloom.
The flattering cry's no longer now, "Fellow,
Was ever man so great, so wise as thou?"
But a pert moral from old Aesop gathers,
That Daws at last must lose their peacocks feathers,
From all the bliss these scenes of pow'r bestow,
Back to the land renown'd for goats I go&mdash;
No longer doom'd a magistrate to reign,
Behold the potent pedagogue again,
Now mighty terrors glow in little hearts,
And bums instinctive feel unwonted smarts.
Thus Dionysius from his throne expell'd,
An equal place in pompous Corinth held:
In Kings and Pedagogues the pow'rs the same,
And rods and sceptres vary but in name.
