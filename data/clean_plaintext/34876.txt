Ah what hard fate attends the living bard,
While cold neglect weighs down his soaring muse,
Dull Fortune's gifts are by the croud preferr'd
To all the poet's more than mortal views.

Unhappy Spenser, in whose sacred strains
Unbounded genius pours her brightest fire:
In vain to Gothic peers thy Muse complains,
In Sorrow's shade she tunes her lofty lyre.

Camoens too, proud Lusitania's boast,
Felt hard unkindness check the noble song;
Tho' daring Gama lives on ev'ry coast,
His poet died amongst the needy throng.

But after-ages yield undying fame,
And dwell delighted on their boundless praise;
While their oppressors live to scorn and shame,
Held forth to vengeance in the Muse's lays,
No grateful song embalms their hated name,
The Muse they scorn'd no Muse their tombs shall raise.
