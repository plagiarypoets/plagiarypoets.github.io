There is a music far beyond the sound
Of instruments, though touched with featliest skill;
Harmony breathing from the heav'n-blest ground,
As wavering vapours from the dewy hill;
It feeds the heart and eyes when all is still,
More felt than seen, and more, I ween,
Than sounds that through the moon's blue beams distil
On the far ear from high monastic quires
Lighted at midnight hour with dim religious fires.

Such music knows he who enjoys a heart
Soft to the touch of beauty &mdash; most of all
To that which kindly nature doth impart
To all her works, or be they great or small;
For nature's works are ever musical;
And while I sat upon the green hill's side,
Watching the little brooklet's flow and fall,
Or looking on the gladsome prospect wide,
To my sight-listening heart that music sweet did glide.
