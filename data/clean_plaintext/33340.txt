As we esteeme the greatest Princes blest
To have their worth by ablest penns exprest
So May wee thinke best poets happy then
When they are read and fam'd by worthy men
Such is thy fate brave Spencer thou hast found
A noble knowing Reader that Can sound
Thy Mistick depths one that [can] give thy due
And make the Age beleeve his Censure true
A Sidney died to kil thy bleeding Hart
A Digby lives to fame thy charming Art
Brave Sidne's Arts and Spirrit in him are known
And he no less then Sidney is thyn owne
Such is thy Digby such thy Sidney was
I could almost beleeve Pithagoras.
