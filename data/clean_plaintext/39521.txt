How swiftly the moments did pass,
And the minutes they all seem'd to fly,
Whilst I sat by my favourite Lass;
But she's gone, and with grief I could die.
Alas!  my poor heart it will break,
For no comfort or peace can I find;
I only can live for her sake,
And she ne'er shall be out of my mind.

Oh!  let her not ever forget
How with transport I view'd her all day,
How pleas'd by her side I did sit,
And the thousand fond things I did say.
I know her kind heart won't disdain
To pity a grief she can't heal;
Could she give relief to my pain,
Then no longer that pain should I feel.

But perhaps I mistaken may be,
And perhaps she no pity will give,
But, indiff'rent, ne'er wishes to see
Or to hear if I die or I live.
'Tis wrong to expect or desire
My fond love she should ever return;
For the Fates do against me conspire,
Yet with passion I ever shall burn.
