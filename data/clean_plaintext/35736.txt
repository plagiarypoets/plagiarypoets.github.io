Where are the heroes?  Sunk in death they lie.
What toiled they for?  Titles and wealth and fame.
But the wide heaven is now their canopy,
And 'legal murderers' their loftiest name.
Enshrined on brass their glory and their shame
What though torn Peace and martyred Freedom see?&mdash;
What though to most remote posterity
Their names, their selfishness, for aye enscrolled,
A shuddering world's unbettered misery?&mdash;
Can this perfection give?  Can valour prove
One wish for others' bliss, one throb of love? . . .
