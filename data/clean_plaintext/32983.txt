Still in the trace of one perplexed thought,
My ceasles cares continually run on:
Seeking in vaine what I have ever sought,
One in my love, and her hard hart still one.
I who did never joy in other Sun,
And have no stars but those, that must fulfill
The worke of rigor, fatally begun
Upon this heart, whom cruelty will kill.
Iniurious DELIA yet I love thee still,
And will whilst I shall draw this breath of mine,
Ile tell the world that I deserv'd but ill,
And blame my selfe t' excuse that heart of thine.
See then who sinnes the greater of us twaine,
I in my love, or thou in thy disdaine.
