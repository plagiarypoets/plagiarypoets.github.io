As rambling in the solitary wood,
When solemn silence through the yellow grove,
Invites my musing, philosophic step,
A smooth, unruffled calm pervades my soul,
And soothes each list'ning sense to taste
The various beauties of autumnal scenes.
When thro' the loaded orchard ambling slow,
I pluck the fairest fruit from ev'ry tree;
The frequent sound of apples falling off
From branches overburden'd with their store,
Awakes attention, looking for the swain,
Whom fancy eager thinks to find engag'd
In shaking from the tree the full ripe fruit.

But now the swain appears beside his cart,
Well fill'd with baskets, and a jovial train
Of children, raising their vocif'rous mirth.
The fields resound with glee of female voice,
And male, in sweet, harmonious task engag'd.
The aged peasant now with hook in hand,
And looks of satisfaction in his face,
From tree to tree shakes off the choicest fruit,
While in the pride of manhood's nervous limbs,
His rugged sons spring up the branching tree,
With muscles vig'rous from salubrious toil,
They shake the lab'ring branches; when forthwith,
A clust'ring show'r descends with thund'ring sound,
And with luxuriant sweetness clothes the ground.
With screams of glee the younger tribe beneath,
In sweet contention for the fairest fruit,
With laughter loud now vex the hapless wight,
Who on his head receiv'd the pelting show'r,
And now with rueful face declares his hurt,
Avers his head is broke and brains beat out,
With hand uplifted soothes his aching crown.

The cart well fill'd now homeward moves along,
Fraught with the richest store; and oft returns,
Till round the creaking mill th' extended heap,
In variegated plenteousness is seen,
Which soon compress'd distils the cheering juice,
The wholesome bev'rage of the hardy swain;
Whose lusty sinews feel its genial force,
And glow with warmth that scorns the winter's cold.

He, not such pleasure feels, whose costly store,
Of choice Madeira's sparkles on his board;
Him, with his dainties in his spacious dome,
The peasant pities; &mdash; quaffs his orchard wine,
That cheers, but not inebriates the soul;
And while the necessaries of life he finds,
Feels not the loss of delicates unknown;
Or known &mdash; despis'd, as sweets for children made.
He with the plainest food enjoys content;
By constant labour from the spleen set free,
That clouds with deepest gloom the sons of wealth;
Whose sickly palates and weak wayward minds
Forever crave unsatisfying joys,
That fleeting, yet forever in their view,
Lead them life's round in quest of airy forms,
Phantoms of vain, imaginary good,
That mock them with the view &mdash; then disappear.
