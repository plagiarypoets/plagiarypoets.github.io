Oh Corydon, where dost thou stray?
To what far distant clime art thou flown,
Where Fame ne'er extended her sway,
Where the Muse and her lute are unknown?

Are the nymphs of those vallies more fair?
Are the charms they possess more divine?
Ah!  inconstant!  how oft didst thou swear,
That no beauty cou'd please thee but mine!

Fond fool that I was, to believe
Such language cou'd never beguile!
That vows were not made to deceive,
Or falshood to lurk in a smile!

Oh Memory!  why the soft scene
Of our loves dost thou ever renew?
Oh why still in vain o'er the green
Do my eyes a false rover pursue?

Oblivion!  sweet balm of our woes,
Where, where thy calm spring shall I find?
Its wave shall restore my repose,
And banish his form from my mind.

Ah no!  thus engrav'd on my heart,
What charm can his image remove?
That will ne'er be erased by art,
Which was drawn by the pencil of Love.
