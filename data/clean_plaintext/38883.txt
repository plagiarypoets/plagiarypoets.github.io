'Twas in the sweet season of spring,
Asleep at the dawn of the day,
I dream'd what I cannot but sing,
So pleasant it seem'd as I lay.
I dream'd, that on ocean afloat,
Far West from fair Albion I sail'd,
While the billows high lifted the boat,
And the fresh-blowing breeze never fail'd.

In the steerage a Woman I saw,
Such, at least, was the form that she wore,
Whose beauty impress'd me with awe
Ne'er taught me by woman before.
She sat, and a shield at her side
Shed light, like a Sun on the waves,
And smiling divinely, she cried,
"I go to make freemen of slaves."

Then raising her voice to a strain
The sweetest that ear ever heard,
She sung of the slave's broken chain,
Wherever her glory appear'd.
Some clouds, which had over us hung
Fled chaced by her melody clear,
And, methought, while she Liberty sung,
It was Liberty only to hear.

Thus, swiftly dividing the flood,
To a slave-cultur'd island we came,
Where a Daemon, her enemy, stood,
Oppression his terrible name.
In his hand, as a sign of his sway,
A scourge hung with lashes he bore,
And stood looking out for his prey
From Africa's sorrowful shore.

But soon as approaching the land
That Goddess-like Woman he view'd,
The scourge he let fall from his hand,
With blood of his subjects embrued.
I saw him both sicken and die,
And, the moment the monster expir'd,
Heard shouts which ascended the sky
From thousands with rapture inspir'd.

Awakening, how could I but muse
On what such a dream might betide?
But soon my ear caught the glad news
Which serv'd my weak thoughts for a guide,
That BRITANNIA, renown'd o'er the waves,
For the hatred she ever has shown
To the black-scepter'd rulers of slaves,
Resolves to have none of her own.
