Where frowns yon hill with beetling brow,
O'er the pale water's eddying round,
Shall thy funereal honours grow,
And mark the wild, deserted ground.

From all their lonely haunts of woe,
The fabled forms of air shall glance,
Mount the low-murmuring stream below,
Or on the whirlwind's wing advance;&mdash;

Here fond remembrance ling'ring still
On friendship's heart thy praise portray,
Maz'd rapture pour the trembling trill,
And join thine own ecstatic lay.

Peace, a cherubic maid, shall come,
And Science sage, a pilgrim old,
Bliss beneath her aromatic bloom,
And Fancy her full flowers unfold.

The linnet here shall build her nest,
To harmonize thy silent vale,
And, plac'd on thy bold, lifeless breast,
The sad harp court the passing gale.

Oft shall the Fates, terrific, throng
The blasted heath's wide, trackless space,
The clouds shall moan with sternest song,
And yells of mourning drear the place.

The shepherd, while, with pliant rod,
He hangs suspended o'er the wave,
Shall pause to mark thy still abode,
And crown with moss thy silent grave&mdash;

Shall weep &mdash; till, rushing on the wind,
Mysterious squadrons crowd the sky,
Heave a deep, dismal dirge, combin'd,
And bid the mortal miscreant fly.

True Poesy's majestic queen
Shall stalk around thy holy clay,
Defend from blights the sacred green,
And scare the Elves of night away.
