Stay thy forebodings, busy, busy mind,
Why need thou feel the bitter blasts that blow?
Why need thou shudder at the Winter's wind,
The petryfying frost or driving snow?

Do not for THEE reviving embers glow?
Is not for THEE the social table spread?
Does not for THEE the horn of plenty flow?
Thou art no beggar of thy daily bread!&mdash;

Yet thou sitt'st trembling o'er thy brooding thoughts,
As if thou wert unshelter'd and forlorn&mdash;
Shudd'ring at scenes of woe, all fancy wrought&mdash;
"Some shiv'ring soul to luckless fortune born,
From weeping wife and famish'd children torn,
Wilder'd and lost in trackless depths of snow!"
At such self-painted prospects must thou mourn!
Must the sigh heave, and tears of sorrow flow!

It is perhaps full human so to do!
For what were life if pity took her flight;
It is full well to weep for others woe,
Yet, let thy faith persuade thee "all is right."

The wretch that sinks, may rise from his dark night
To scenes of brighter bliss that shall not cease,
Meet his lov'd friends in realms of endless light
Perpetual sunshine and perpetual peace.
