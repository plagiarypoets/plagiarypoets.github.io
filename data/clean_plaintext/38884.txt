When I was a young man I long'd
To know what the world was a doing,
To London with others I throng'd,
Nor knew well what I was pursuing.
But, good lack-a-day, what a din!
I through the croud scarcely could bustle:
In every place I was in,
To pass the folks I had a tustle.

But what I did mostly admire,
Was the busy air of each creature;
Which seem'd so their thoughts to inspire,
Dull care was imprest in each feature.
In highest and lowest degree,
Odzookers!  in every station,
They all Politicians would be,
And govern and settle the nation.

I found it a folly to roam,
Such hurry and bustle was teazing:
The joys I had tasted at home,
A thousand times sure were more pleasing.
So back to our hamlet I came,
And entered in Hymen's soft fetters,
With Dolly, my fond loving dame,
And left care and strife to my betters.
