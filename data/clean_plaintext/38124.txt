It is the twilight hour:
There is no breath upon the air to break
The silvery veil that floats o'er earth's wan cheek;
Day hath departed like the dream
That draws the poet's sighs,
And left behind the shadow and the gleam
From those far gates which close on Paradise!
Now fairy elves have power;
And the light gossamer on the deep of air
Hangs her fine film &mdash; for all is silent there!
The Spirit of Love descendeth from her heaven,
And sinks in the full heart to rapture given,
Like dew upon the flower.

It is the twilight hour:
The hues of feeling, life, and love are fled;
Like Beauty's cheek her breath of roses shed!
The soul with tenderness o'erflows
By its own joy oppressed:
The calm, the fragrance round deep languor throws,
Raising vain dreams of passion and of rest,
The fond heart's hopeless dower.
All are in sleep, or in that breathlessness
When tranced love pauses ere again it bless;
The dewy star looks forth in light above,
The maiden only sighing for her love,
Sits in her lonely bower!

It is the twilight hour:
Heaven's deepest azure opens round on high,
Veiling behind unknown eternity:
The dews of evening steal upon
The senses' saddened mood,
Soft as the memories of music gone;
The flowers, the dim flowers bend their heads subdued,
And drink the ethereal shower.
Earth fades in mystery, and the deepening gloom
Folds o'er her like the shadow of the tomb:
Night draws her starred tiara on her brow,
And Darkness gathers round the world &mdash; and now
Farewell the twilight hour!
