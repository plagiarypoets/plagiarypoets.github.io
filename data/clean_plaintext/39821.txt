Prop'd in an elbow-chair, Fumoso sat,
With legs divaricating, and with heels
Recumbent on the stove's projecting plate.
Around his head, in sombrous volumes roll'd
The clouds of pungent smoke, from volute leaf
Of plant perfum'd, delicious with the scent
Of od'rous bean, dear bought, and brought from far!
His head sublime, thrown back in lofty state,
The ceiling's height contemplates; nor disturb'd
Its musing trance, except betimes to squirt
The sputtering streams of bland saliva off,
Nor minds the plaints of Betty or of Jack,
For brass resplendent sullied; or the spots
That mar the nicely blacken'd, shining face
Of Franklin's economic fount of heat.
While on the mantle stands the cheering glass
Of Gallic cordial, temper'd with the stream
Of limpid Schuylkill, which erewhile he sips,
And feels his soul expand, and dreams of bliss
Supreme, in Fancy's airy visions lost.
In his mind's eye he sees the blooming fair
Simper, or smile upon him; &mdash; she, for whom
He almost would resign the fragrant fumes
Of lov'd segar, and purify his breath.
But now Ambition fires his swelling thoughts,
With schemes of public good.  He dares to court
And win the people's voice.  The senate hears
His voice, resounding in her spacious hall,
And patriots listen, while Fumoso rails.
His hand aloft extending, wav'd sublime
In circle bold &mdash; alas!  the blazing top
Of taper sunk it strikes &mdash; the light's extinct!
His knuckles too are sing'd! &mdash; the charm dissolves!
His last segar begins to scorch his lip;
The drowsy watchman bellows "dwelf a glock!"
Fumoso starts!  relumes the extinguish'd wick,
And sadly silent seeks the sweets of sleep.
Sic transit gloria mundi.
