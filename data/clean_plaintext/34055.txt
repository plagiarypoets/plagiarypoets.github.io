When Ramsay drew Montgomery heavenly maid,
And gaz'd with wonder on that angel face,
Pleas'd I sat by, and joyful survey'd
The darren pencil image every grace.

When as the youth, each feature o'er and o'er
Careful retouch'd with strict observant view;
Eftsoons I saw how charms unseen before
Swell'd to the sight, and with the picture grew.

With milder glances now he arms her eyes,
The red now triumphs to a brighter rose;
Now heaves her bosom to a softer rise,
And fairer on her cheek the lilly blows.

Last glow'd the blush that pure of female wile,
I whilom knew when so my stars decreed,
My pipe she daign'd to laud in pleasing smile,
All undeserving I such worthy meed.

The whiles I gaz'd, ah!  felice Art thought I,
Ah!  felice youth that doen it possess;
Couth to depeint the fair so verily,
True to each charm, and faithful to each grace.

Sythence she cannot emulate her skill,
Ne envy will the Muse her sisters praise,
Then for the deed, O let her place the will,
And to the glowing colours join her layes.

Yet algates would the nine, that high on hill
Parnasse, sweet Imps of Jove, with Jove reside,
Give me to rein the feiry steed at will,
And with kind hand thy lucky pencil guide.

Then certes mought we fate misprise, of praise
Secure, if the dear maid in beauties bloom
Survive, or in thy colours, or my lays,
Joy of this age, and joy of each to come.
