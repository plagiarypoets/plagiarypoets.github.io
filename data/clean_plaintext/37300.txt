Whilom in Philadelphia dwelt a youth,
Who ne' in office hours did take delight,
But spent his days in reading books uncouth,
Nor laid them by e'en at the frown of night.
Ah, me!  in sooth, he was an idle wight,
Sore given to reading books of chivalry:&mdash;
While tales of love, and war, and wonder he,
With marvellous patience, sought and read right eagerly.

His face he turn'd unto the setting sun,
Whose rising ray illumined his back side;
Bending his way unto the woodlands dun,
Whose rivers westward roll their gentle tide.
He parted heavily with only one,
From childhood upward whom he call'd his friend&mdash;
To him would he, the day of travel done,
His gray goose quill y'seize, a line to send&mdash;
E'en this rude lay for him right patiently he penn'd.

Lancaster, Harrisburgh, Carlisle are past,
Anon he journies o'er the mountains blue,
City of smoke, Pittsburgh, appears at last,
Fruitful in &mdash; and smiths of sable hue&mdash;
By still Monongahela's willow trees,
And swifter Alleghany's stream, he hied
To calm Ohio's wooded shores.  He sees
Damsels of laughing eye.  The pleader sigh'd,
For his was far away, by winding Schuylkill's tide.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Oh, what is man!  The shadow of a shade!
In love and friendship equally undone;&mdash;
Hath heaven no pity for the wretch it made,
And I, alas!  the most unhappy one!
And what is life?  A flower that soon will fade;&mdash;
Alike its sorrows and its joys to me;
Its hopes of yesterday, all, all betray'd,
And, therefore, to the wilderness I flee,
Far from the haunt of man and his "ungodly glee."

No passing cloud my dawn has overcast,
This storm will only with existence end&mdash;
One only anchor holds the galliot fast,
On one weak cable doth its fate depend&mdash;
A billow breaks it &mdash; and when storms impend,
Can it escape the fury of the sea?
But I have ceased with sorrows to contend,
And from misfortunes do no longer flee&mdash;
Fate's wasted quiver now hath not a shaft for me.

Ah, father Adam!  but for thine offence,
The earth an Eden might have ever been;
Eternal spring, and bowers forever green,
But for thy trespass, still had smil'd on men&mdash;
My talisman of bliss another kept&mdash;
Or earth had still an Eden been to me.
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

The pleader landed on Virginia's shore,
So named from England's cruel maiden queen&mdash;
The hostess' sign a soaring eagle bore,
That little like an eagle look'd, I ween.
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

The hospitable board was soon y'spread,
The host and hunger press'd him to partake,
While "niggers" brushed the flies from round his head,
And eggs and bacon suffered, and corn cake,
And fork and knife he played right desperately,
The wrinkles from his jerkin to ytake,
The while his gayer comrade joked sly
With many a sally, mirth to keep awake,
And often rais'd the bowl his frequent thirst to slake.

The matron grave, as matron ought to be,
Her hopes and fears concentring in one,
One daughter &mdash; modest, not devoid of glee;&mdash;
Ah, happy he by whom her love is won!
Surrounded thus the moments hastened on,
Till to his couch the weary rover hied;
Refresh'd by rest he hail'd the matin song,
And strait prepared adown the stream to glide&mdash;
Albeit within that house he longer wish'd to bide.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
Sons of the forest!  did the pleader say,
Whose names tradition and oblivion gave,
While time hath wrought the ruin that I see,
Is now unchang'd; of passion yet the slave,
And beat his heart like mine, who sleeps in yonder grave.

Did passion prey upon his quiet then,
Did disappointment passion's victory mar,
Was bliss a rainbow unapproach'd by men,
And love a meteor bringing dole and care?
The earth may perish with its scenes sublime,
And time with years may dim yon rising star,
Darkness and light may quit the march of time,
And chaos may revive anear and far,
Yet man be still the same, with head and heart at war.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Yet must he pause &mdash;  your pardon, Thomas, pray&mdash;
To write of charms that would have moved a bear,
To dwell on golden smiles, with fond delay,
That chased his griefs as greyhounds chase a hare.
One summer evening did the roving 'squire
A damozel discover, passing fair&mdash;
Whose castle rose, of logs, ten feet and higher,
Half hidden by a wood of gloom, and there
He hearty welcome met and tolerable fare.

Why should I number every figment made
To gain the love of that too tempting fair,
Why should I say how long the pleader stay'd
And "sigh'd, and look'd, and swore, and triumph'd there?
When parting came, he kiss'd the starting tear,
That trembled in poor Lucy's azure eye,
And half resolv'd, &mdash; the fiftieth time, I fear&mdash;
Passion's ungenerous wishes to deny,
Nor raise in bosom fair the soft accusing sigh.

And did he leave her, as a thing of naught,
To sigh in secret over her love and shame&mdash;
So little prized he what so long he sought,
And went indifferent as he careless came?
He went despondent &mdash; for her pallid cheek
Had touch'd his conscience &mdash; but he fled from love,
Unbroken solitudes ybent to seek
The dreary prairie, and the solemn grove&mdash;
Till on the lonely shores of Erie he mote rove.

But he is gone who shed on this lone lake
The light of his imperishable name,&mdash;
A name as great as chivalry could make,
And to his country dear and dear to fame;
Youthful and brave &mdash; thy course how bright and brief,
That closed ere others honors have begun.
Those billows murmur dirges to the chief,
Whose body rests beneath a warmer sun&mdash;
His memory, mournful, hail'd with many a grateful gun.

Death moved not him, and yet perchance he mote
Have wish'd to meet it in another form;
Where battle raises its discordant note,
And heroes meet and perish in its storm&mdash;
But he is gone, and tars that bled with him,
"Albeit unused to the melting mood,"
Shall eye with musing sad, the shatter'd limb,
And shed a tear for Perry brave and good.

Montgomery's ashes were with pomp convey'd
Into the land for which the warrior fell&mdash;
Shall Erie's victor then, afar be laid
From that dear country, loved and served so well;
Lawrence is sleeping &mdash; but his grave is made
Where kindled spirits weep upon his urn&mdash;
He, that is laid beneath the orange shade,
Asks, in imploring silence, brief return.

CANTO II.
INSCRIBED TO MY BROTHER, AT AULD REEKIE.
O, Scotia, shall I never press thy soil,
Thy plains and mountains shall I never see&mdash;
Up, old Ben Lomond shall I never toil,
And must Loch Kathrine never smile for me?
Land of the great!  instanter would I flee,
Wealth, pleasure, Lucy, for thy lone-hill side,
To breathe the air that Royal Robert breathed,
And see the pass where gallant Grahame died&mdash;
O chivalry!  how low hath ebbed thy tide.

Thus was the pleader to apostrophise
Led by the inscription on the other leaf,
Having at frequent intervals such sighs
As would have moved the pity of a thief&mdash;
Yet with success exceeding all belief,
His discontent did he attempt to smother,
And found in whiskey punch no slight relief&mdash;
From devils blue, while musing on his brother,
"Mine host," he cries, "a drink &mdash; another &mdash; and another."

The moon is up, and in a peerless night&mdash;
Her lustre dims the "lesser lights" of heaven,
And offers to the restless wanderer's sight,
The moonlight aspect of a summer's even;
Ohio's wave reflects the silver light,
That shews afar the silver light,
Mellowed by mist and distance.  All is bright
Save that dark mountain's shadow. &mdash; All is still
Save when the bull-frog croaks to the lone whip-poor-will.

I cannot sleep &mdash; the very stars will tell,
Of former joys in many a night like this;
I cannot sleep &mdash; while moonlight spreads her spell,
And memory dwells on former faded bliss.
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

But let me wander not from my intention,
The retrospect of our unclouded days&mdash;
Ere love and sorrow came in black contention,
Or I anticipated love or lays;
The summer's day for us was all too brief,
E'en now my heart in every woodland strays,
Where we escaped Corderius &mdash; trouble chief,
That then perplexed us, envious time repays&mdash;
With years of sorrow now &mdash; those happy, happy days.

"There scattered oft &mdash; the earliest of the year,
By hands unseen, are showers of vi'lets found,"
There have I lingered pensively to hear&mdash;
The pine tree wave with soothing solemn sound;
There have I oft beneath its pleasing shade&mdash;
In languor thro' the summer's day reclin'd,
Musing on some imaginary maid,
Some lovely phantom of the vacant mind,
As fair as &mdash;, more faithful far and kind.

The world to us was as a fairy land,
A vista of delights withouten end;
We saw the flowers that bloomed on either hand,
But not the adder, that his coil did bend
Around their stem &mdash; Hope too, would wanton lend
More blushing colors than the rose cold give,
To paint what lay behind &mdash; where did impend
Grim disappointment &mdash; lot of all who live,
Then why should I repine, when all the living grieve.

In the first person, I shall henceforth write,
Dropping the pleader &mdash; e'en as Harold ceased,
In the fourth Canto of his pilgrimage&mdash;
With which, en passant, I am somewhat pleased,
And for a lord who wore the "cockle shell,"
And "sandall shoon," I think it very well.

Thus much premised, this Canto I will close,
With an epistle to our friend in Coosaw&mdash;
Where I in May was hunting bucks and does,
And alligators, such as never you saw.
And lounged about, beneath the tall palmettos,
Sucking a lime, or munching sweet potatoes.
(To be continued.)
