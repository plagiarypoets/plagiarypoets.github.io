What are those tablets round me?  living minds
The mighty soul in form and pressure wrought;&mdash;
Unfolded natures &mdash; where the vision winds
Thro' what was dreams, deep throb, unuttered thought:
There breathes Salvator!  That red lightning shot
From its dark throne to fire that forest hoar,
That combat in its burnings madly fought,
That lake convuls'd before the tempest's roar,
All to Salvator's soul toss'd, battl'd, burn'd before.

Here, Raphael!  is revealed the mystery,
That fixed the hectic crimson on thy cheek&mdash;
Here sank the earnest radiance of thine eye,
Dying beneath the passionate thought that wreck
Spirits like thine; &mdash; those eagle flights that seek
And perish in the sun-beams; glorious fires
That from their heaven around the mountain break
With crowning splendour, till the storm retires,
Leaving but smoke and dust of all its marble spires.

Resplendent Titian!  what a host of thoughts,
What memories of stars and midnight moons,
And long hours pass'd beneath the emerald vaults
Of forests; and the sweet eve's thousand tunes,
When the breeze rushes through the vine festoons,
Show'ring their dew drops, are concentered here!
And forms the prince and knight in proud saloons,
And dames with dark Italian eyes, that ne'er
Knew sorrow, but wept the heart's bewitching tear.

Prometheus of the pencil!  life and light
Burst on the canvas from thy mighty hand,
All hues sublime that ever dazzled sight
Where tempests die on Heaven, or ever waned
On hills, the evening's azure thrones, or stain'd
Ruby or beryl in their Indian cell,
Or glanced from gem-dropt wing, or blossom vein'd,
Or tinged in ocean caves the radiant shell,
All, at thy sceptre's wave, from all their fountains swell.
