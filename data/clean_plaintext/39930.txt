Is this the dwelling of imperial pride!
Are these the glories of immortal Rome?
Did pomp and power within these walls reside?
Where are the courts, the towers, the gilded dome?
See!  lizards start, where kings had once their home;
And statue, arch, and column rudely whirled,
Scoff at the wild enthusiast who can roam,
And find in loathsome vaults, and ruins hurled
Age after age &mdash; "the golden mansion of the world!"

Ah!  little did they dream, who reared yon pile,
That creeping ivy on its top should grow;
That she whose empire, from the Northern Isle
To where old Atlas lifts his burning brow,
O'er myriad nations swept &mdash; should be as now,
When young barbarians from an unknown shore&mdash;
Pilgrims of freedom &mdash; wander here to bow
At her still sacred altar &mdash; to explore
What ruthless time has left &mdash; to wonder and deplore.

Yet, even in those days of boundless power,
Prophetic visions hovered o'er the sight
Of one illustrious sage &mdash; he saw the hour,
The sure, though distant hour, when all the light
Of beauty, genius, science &mdash; all the might
And glory of ambition unrepressed,
Should, from their eastern cradle, wing their flight
To climes, by dreaming poets called the blest,
The unseen &mdash; the yet unknown &mdash; ATLANTIS of the west.

That there, 'mid circling hills and cloudless skies,
The muse again should dwell &mdash; new arts should vie,
The breathing marble, and the varied dyes,
To nature strongly true:  than these, more high,
Triumphant virtue, fame that may defy
Time's withering touch, and freedom boldly gained
As in Rome's day of glory, ah!  gone by,
And &mdash; not as then, by vice, ambition, stained&mdash;
Long should they dwell with thee, ATLANTIS!  unprofaned.
