Ye shepherds and nymphs of the plain,
O attend for a while to my lays;
Give heed to a sorrowful swain,
Who all his misfortunes displays.

Lucinda, the lovely, the gay,
Who all my affections doth share,
She's sweet as the flowers in May,
But cruel, alas!  as she's fair.

She treats me with scorn and disdain,
My sighs are all lost in her ears;
She triumphs and laughs at my pain,
And cruelly sports at my tears!

Thus, despairing, I spend all my days,
Nor can I expect to be blest;
Depriv'd both of comfort and ease,
My soul is a stranger to rest.

I'll seek some disconsolate cell,
Remote from the maid I adore,
No more near her beauties I'll dwell,
I'll contemplate her virtues no more

There unknown I'll repeat all my woes,
Unheard of lament my hard fate;
Since Lucinda such cruelty shews,
Death only shall end my sad state.
