To Chaucer!  who the English tongue design'd,
To Spencer!  who improv'd it, and refin'd&mdash;
But chiefly thou Dan Spencer, peerless bard
Sith in these pleasaunt groves you gan devise
Of Red-cross knight, and virtue's high reward
And here first plann'd thy works of high and vast emprize,
Descend!  nor thy inferior sons despise,
Chaunting her praises on this festal day,
Who taught us, where the road to honour lies.
Her steps still marking out the arduous way:
Blest is the theme I ween, and blessed be the lay.
