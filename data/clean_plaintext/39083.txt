Down the variegated side
Of Edgecombe's far-recorded Knowl,
(Joy of Nereids, Cornwall's pride)
Where Art extends her mild controul
But just to check what Nature's liberal hand
Has spread in gay luxuriance wide
Of rocks, dells, groves, a fairy land;
The Muse, astonish'd, trac'd her ling'ring way,
Unsettled what to leave, and wond'ring where to stay.
