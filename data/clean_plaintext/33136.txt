ROGET.  WILLIE.

ROGET.
Prithee Willy, tell me this,
What new thing late hapned is,
Thou (that wert the blythest lad)
Art become so wondrous sad?
And so careless of thy quill,
As if thou had'st lost thy skill.
Thou wert wont to charme thy Flockes,
And among the massy rockes
Hast so cheer'd me with thy Song,
That I have forgot my wrong.
Something hath thee surely crost,
That thy old wont thou hast lost,
But what is't?  Have I ought said
That hath made thee misapaid?
Hath some Churle done thee a spite?
Dost thou misse a lambe to night?
Frownes thy fairest Shepheards Lasse?
Or how comes this ill to passe?
Is there any discontent
Worse than this my banishment?

WILLIE.
Why, doth that so evil seeme
That thou nothing worse dost deeme?
Shepheard, there full many be,
That will change Contents with thee.
Those that choose their walkes at will,
On the valley or the Hill.
Or those pleasures boast of can
Groves or fields may yeeld to man:
Never come to know the rest
Wherewithal thy minde is blest.
Many a one that oft resorts
To make up the troope at sports,
And in company somewhile,
Happens to straine forth a smile:
Feeles more want, more outward smart,
And more inward griefe of hart,
Than this place can bring to thee,
While thy minde remaineth free.
Thou condemn'st my want of mirth,
But what find'st thou in this earth,
Wherein ought may bee beleeved
Worth to make me joy'd or grieved?
And yet feele I (natheless)
Part of both, I must confess.
Sel'd, yet for such causes small:
But I grieve not now at all.

ROGET.
Why hath WILLY then so long
Thus forborne his wonted song?
Wherefore doth he now let fall,
His well-tuned Pastorall?
And my eares that Musicke barre,
Which I more long after farre
Than the liberty I want.

WILLIE.
That were very much to grant.
But doth this hold alway lad,
Those that sing not must be sad?
Did'st thou ever that bird heare
Sing well, that sings all the yeare?
Tom the Piper doth not play
Till he weares his Pipe away:
Theres a time to slacke the string,
And a time to leave to sing.

ROGET.
Yea, but no man now is still,
That can sing or tune a quill.
Now to chant it were but reason;
Song and Musicke are in season.
Now in this sweet jolly tide,
Is the earth in all her pride.
The fair Lady of the May
Trimm'd up in her best array
Hath invited all the Swaines
With the Lasses of the Plaines,
To attend upon her sport
At the places of resort.
Coridon (with his bold Rout)
Hath already been about
For the elder Shepheards dole:
And fetcht in the Summer-Pole;
Whilst the rest have built a Bower,
To defend them from a shower,
Seil'd so close with boughs all greene,
Tytan cannot pry betweene.
Now the Dayrie Wenches dreame
Of their Strawberries and Creame.
And each doth her selfe advance
To be taken in, to dance.
Every one that knows to sing,
Fits him for his Carrolling:
So doe those that hope for meede,
Either by the Pipe or Reed,
And though I am kept away,
I doe hear (this very day)
Many learned Groomes doe wend,
For the Garlands to contend
Which a Nymph that hight Desart,
(Long a stranger in this part)
With her owne faire hand hath wrought
A rare worke (they say) past thought,
As appeareth by the name,
For she calles them Wreathes of Fame.
She hath set in their due place
Every flower that may grace,
And among a thousand moe,
(Whereof some but serve for show)
She hath wove in Daphnes tree,
That they may not blasted bee.
Which with Time she edged about,
That it might not shatter out.
And that they might wither never,
Intermixt it with Live-ever.
These are to bee shared among
Those that do excell for song:
Or their passions can rehearse
In the smooth'st and sweetest verse.
Then for those among the rest
That can play and pipe the best,
There's a Kidling with the Damme,
A fat Weather, and a Lambe.
And for those that leapen farre,
Wrastle, Runne, and throw the Barre,
Ther's appointed guerdons too:
He that best the first can doe,
Shall for his reward, be paid
With a Sheepe-hooke, faire in-laid
With fine bone, of a strange beast
That men bring from out the west.
For the next, a Scrip of red,
Tassel'd with fine coloured thred.
Then for him that's quick'st of foote,
A Cup of turned Maple-roote:
Whereupon the skilfull man
Hath ingrav'd the Loves of Pan.
And the last hath for his due,
A fine Napkin wrought with blew.
Then my Willy what moves thee,
Thus forgetfull now to be?
What mak'st thou here with a wight
That is shut up from delight:
In a solitary den,
As not fit to live with men.
Go my Willy get thee gone,
Leave me in exile alone;
Hye thee to that merry throng,
And amaze them with thy Song.
Thou art yong, yet such a Lay
Never graced the month of May,
As (if they provoke thy skill)
Thou canst fit unto thy Quill.
I with wonder heard thee sing,
At our last yeares Revelling.
Then I with the rest was free,
When unknowne I noted thee:
And perceiv'd the ruder Swaines,
Envie thy farre sweeter straines.
Yea I saw the Lasses cling
Round about thee in a Ring:
As if each one jealous were,
Any but herselfe should heare.
And I know they yet do long
For the res'due of thy song.
Haste thee then to sing it forth,
Take the benefit of worth.
And Desert will sure bequeath
Fames faire garland for thy wreath.
Hye thee Willy, hye away.

WILLIE.
Roget rather let me stay,
And be desolate with thee,
Than at those their Revels be;
Nought such is my skill I wis,
As indeed thou deem'st it is.
But what ere it be, I must
Be content, and shall, I trust.
For a song I doe not passe,
Mong'st my friends, but what (alas)
Should I have to doe with them
That my Musicke do contemne?
Some there are, as well I wot,
That the same yet favour not:
Yet I cannot well avow,
They my Carrols disallow.
But such malice I have spid,
Tis as much as if they did.

ROGET.
Willy, what may those men be,
Are so ill to malice thee?

WILLIE.
Some are worthy-well esteem'd,
Some without worth are so deem'd.
Others of so base a spirit,
They have nor esteeme, nor merit.

ROGET.
What's the wrong?

WILLIE.
A slight offence,
Wherewithall I can dispence;
But hereafter for their sake,
To myself I'le musicke make.

ROGET.
What, because some Clowne offends,
Wilt thou punish all thy friends?

WILLIE.
Honest Roget, understand me,
Those that love me may command me.
But thou know'st, I am but young,
And the Pastorall I sung,
Is by some suppos'd to bee
(By a straine) too high for me.
So they kindly let me gaine,
Not my labour, for my paine.
Trust me, I do wonder why
They should me my owne deny.
Though I'me yong, I scorne to flit
On the wings of borrowed wit.
I'le make my own feathers reare me
Whither others cannot beare me.
Yet I'le keep my skill in store,
Till I've seen some Winters more.

ROGET.
But in earnest mean'st thou so?
Then thou art not wise, I trow.
Better shall advise thee Pan,
For thou dost not rightly than:
That's the ready way to blot
All the credit thou hast got.
Rather in thy Ages prime,
Get another start of Time:
And make those that so fond be,
(Spite of their owne dulnesse) see
That the sacred Muses can
Make a child in yeares, a man.
It is knowne what thou canst do,
For it is not long agoe,
When that CUDDY, Thou, and I,
Each the others skill to try,
At Saint Dunstanes charmed Well,
(As some present there can tell)
Sang upon a sudden Theame,
Sitting by the Crimson streame.
Where, if thou didst well or no,
Yet remaines the song to show.
Much experience more I've had,
Of thy skill (thou happy Lad)
And would make the world to know it,
But that time will further show it.
Envy makes their tongues now runne,
More than doubte of what is donne.
For that needs must be thy owne,
Or to be some other's knowne:
But how then willt suit unto
What thou shalt hereafter do?
Or I wonder where is hee,
Would with that song part to thee:
Nay, were there so mad a swaine,
Could such glory sell for gaine,
Phoebus would not have combin'd
That gift with so base a mind.
Never did the Nine impart
The sweet secrets of their Art
Unto any that did scorne
To have their faire Badge seen worne,
Therefore unto those that say,
Were they pleased to sing a Lay,
They could doo 't, and will not tho;
This I speake, for this I know:
None ere drunke the Thespian Spring,
And knew how, but he did sing.
For that once infus'd in man
Makes him shew't, doe what he can.
Nay, those that doe only sip,
Or but ev'n their fingers dip
In that sacred Fount (poore Elves)
Of that brood will show themselves;
Yea, in hope to get them fame,
They will speake though to their shame
Let those then at thee repine,
That by their wits measure thine.
Needs those Songs must be thine owne,
And that one day will be knowne,
The same imputation to,
I my selfe doe undergo:
But it will be knowne ere long,
I'me abus'd, and thou hast wrong,
Who at twice ten have sung more
Than some will doe at fourescore.
Cheere thee (honest Willy) then,
And begin thy song agen.

WILLY.
Faine I would, but I do feare
When againe my Lines they heare,
If they yeeld they are my Rimes,
They will finde some other Crimes.
And 'tis no safe ventring by,
Where we see detraction lye.
For doe what I can, I doubt,
She will pick some quarrell out,
And I oft have heard defended,
Little said, is soone amended.

ROGET.
See'st thou not in cleerest dayes
Oft thick fogges cloud Heavens rayes?
And the vapours that do breath
From the earths grosse womb beneath,
Seeme not to us with blacke steames,
To pollute the Sunnes bright beames,
And yet vanish into aire,
Leaving them (unblemisht) faire?
So (my Willy) shall it bee
With detractions breath and thee.
It shall never rise so hye,
As to staine thy Poesie.
Like the Sunne shee oft exhales
Vapours from each rot'nest vales;
But so much her power may doo,
That she can dissolve them too.
If thy verse do bravely tower,
As she makes wing, she gets power,
Yet the higher she doth sore,
Shee's affronted still the more:
Till she to the high'st hath past,
Then she rests with fame at last.
Let nought therefore thee affright,
But make forward in thy flight:
For if I could match thy Rime,
To the very starres I'd clime,
There begin againe and flye
Till I reach'd Aeternity.
But (alas) my Muse is slow:
For thy pace she flagges too low.
Yea, the more's her haplesse fate,
Her short wings were clipt of late,
And poore I, her fortune ruing,
Am my selfe put up a muing.
But if I my Cage can rid,
I'le flye where I never did.
And though for her sake I'me crost,
Though my best hopes I have lost,
And knew she would make my trouble
Ten times more than ten times double,
I would love and keep her toe
Spight of all the world could doe.
For though banisht from my flockes,
And confined within these rockes,
Here I waste away the light,
And consume the sullen Night,
She doth for my comfort stay,
And keepes many cares away.
Though I misse the flowry Fields,
With those sweetes the Spring-tide yeelds,
Though I may not see those Groves,
Where the shepheards chaunt their Loves,
And the Lasses more excell,
Than the sweet-voyc'd Philomel,
Though of all those pleasures past
Nothing now remaines at last,
But Remembrance (poore reliefe)
That more makes, than mends my griefe.
She's my minds companion still,
Maugre Envies evil will.
Whence she should be driven to,
Wert 't in mortals power to do.
She doth tell me where to borrow
Comfort in the midst of sorrow;
Makes the desolatest place
To her presence be a grace,
And the blackest discontents
Be her fairest ornaments.
In my former dayes of blisse,
Her divine thoughts taught me this,
That from everything I saw
I could some invention draw:
And raise pleasure to her hight,
Through the meanest object's sight.
By the murmur of a spring,
Or the least leaves rustling.
By a Dazie whose leaves spread
Shut when Tytan goes to bed,
Or a shady bush or tree,
She could more infuse in me,
Than all Natures beauties can,
In some other wiser man.
By her helpe I also now,
Make this churlish place allow
Somethings, that may sweeten gladnesse
In the very gall of sadnesse.
The dull loannesse, the blacke shade
That these hanging vaults have made,
The strange Musicke of the waves,
Beating on these hollow Caves.
This grim den which Rockes embosse,
Over-growne with eldest moss,
The rude portals that give light,
More to Terror then Delight.
This my Chamber of Neglect,
Wal'd about with Disrespect,
From all these, and this dull aire,
A fit object for Despaire,
Shee hath taught mee by her might
To draw comfort and delight.
Therefore thou best earthly blisse
I will cherish thee for this.
Poesy; thou sweet'st content
That e'er Heav'n to mortals lent.
Though they as a trifle leave thee
Whose dull thoughts cannot conceive thee
Though thou bee to them a scorne
That to nought but earth are borne:
Let my life no longer bee
Than I am in love with thee.
Though our wise ones call thee madnesse,
Let me never taste of gladnesse
If I love not thy mad'st fits
More than all their greatest wits.
And though some too seeming holy
Do account thy raptures folly:
Thou dost teach mee to contemne
What makes Knaves and Fooles of them.
Oh, high power!  that oft doth carry
Men above

WILLIE.
Good Roget tarry,
I do feare thou wilt begone
Quite above my reach anon,
The kind flames of Poesy
Have now borne thy thoughts so high,
That they up in Heaven bee
And have quite forgotten mee.
Call thy selfe to minde againe
Are these Raptures for a Swaine,
That attends on lowly sheepe
And with simple heards doth keepe?

ROGET.
Thankes my Willy, I had runne
Till that Time had lodg'd the Sunne,
If thou had'st not made mee stay;
But thy pardon here I pray.
Lov'd Apollo's sacred sire
Had rais'd up my spirits higher
Through the love of Poesy
Than indeed they use to flye.
But as I said, I say still,
If that I had Willi's skill
Envy nor Detraction's tongue,
Should ere make me leave my song,
But I'de sing it every day
Till they pin'd themselves away.
Be thou then advis'd in this
Which both just and fitting is,
Finish what thou hast begunne
Or at least still forward runne,
Haile and Thunder ill he'le beare
That a blast of wind doth feare:
And if words will thus affray thee,
Prithee how will deeds dismay thee?
Do not thinke so rathe a song
Can passe through the vulgar throng
And escape without a touch,
Or that they can hurt it much:
Frosts wee see do nip that thing
Which is forwardst in the Spring:
Yet at last for all such lets
Somewhat of the rest it gets:
And I'me sure that so maist thou;
Therefore, my kind Willy now,
Since thy folding time drawes on
And I see thou must bee gone,
I no more of this will say
Till we meete next holiday.
