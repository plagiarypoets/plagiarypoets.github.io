No lack of courtesy in deed or mind
Stain'd the rare wight wrought the tale ye hear,
Yet therewithal this warning word he join'd;
"Strains such as these befit no baser ear:
To carles, to faitours, to unfolden clear,
Love's mystick lore doth much that lore profane;
To clerks, to knights, to melting damsels dear,
Yet more than all who weep for other's pain,
Love's lessons and delights do chiefly appertain."
