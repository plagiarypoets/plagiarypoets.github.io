Where is the hand to paint in colours bright
The vivid splendour of the western sky,
That sparkling flood of evanescent light,
Pure and transparent, deepening in its dye.
Elysian bowers and isles of rest on high
Float o'er the amber tide, and pass away;
Each moment changing to the raptured eye.
Alas!  no mortal hand can that blest vision stay,
Guido's nor Titian's art can fix that fading ray.

O!  I have gazed, when silent and alone,
Till I forgot the globe my feet have prest;
Have seen the shores of some bright world unknown,
And souls amid the mansions of the blest:
Scenes not for man, nor mortal senses drest:
Bright rosy meads, and seas of waving light
And fairy barks that on those waters rest;
They darken, they are gone; as fades the light,
And leave me still on earth enveloped all in night.

So fade the prospects early fancy forms
When life is fresh, and all the world is new;
Bright are the clouds which soon must meet in storms,
Bright all with hope, too happy to be true.
Soon sets the beam, and darkness bounds the view,
So the etherial soul which did this body move
Leaves the dull clod on earth from which it grew;
Glances away, where sister souls above
Bloom in immortal youth, immortal light and love.
