Weep not, bereaved mother, for thy son
Is far beyond this world of strife and care,
And to that happy land of souls is gone,
The rich eternal joys of heaven to share.
Weep not, thou shalt behold thy loved one there,
When hours of sorrow are for ever o'er,
And join the immortal hosts of spirits fair
Far, far from earth's dark dreary troubled shore,
Where death's overwhelming power destroys our hopes no more.

But blasting are the storms of grief that rise
Within a fondest, kindest mother's breast;
And deep, deep are the anguish of her sighs
When she hath lost the child she oft hath prest
To her fond heart and hush'd to gentle rest,&mdash;
Whose beauties she had watch'd from morn to noon,
Of childhood sweet; and when in beauty drest,
She pray'd for length of years to him; ah!  soon
Death triumps o'er  her hopes!  for heaven denies the boon.
