This nice-penn'd card fair Henrietta sends
Around to all her fashionable friends:
"Miss Henrietta Walsingham presents
To Miss Belinda Blah her compliments,
And asks the pleasure of her company
On Thursday evening next, the 5th, to tea."

Bustle begins; &mdash; and all above, below,
Gives note of preparation for the show.
Gowns, ribbons, caps, the busy parlour fill;
The kitchen is a scene more busy still.
There, maid and mistress, servants black and white,
Armed cap-a-pee, in common cause unite.
The oven flames, the stirring spoon goes round,
Eggs rise in foam, and labouring mortars sound.
Butter and flour with spice and sugar join;
Milk, water, cream, with isinglass combine:
Buns, custards, hearts and rounds, are smoking here;
There, jellies, syllabubs, blanc-mange appear;
And pound-cake, plum-cake, seed-cake, rise in state,
Till the full tables groan beneath the weight.

Revolving time, big with the fate of kings
And love-sick girls, the appointed evening brings.
Prompt to the call, and willing to obey,
First come the fair, in costly plumage gay:&mdash;
Like truant school-boys, backward kept by fear,
The tardy gentlemen at last appear.
The assembly now presents two stately rows:
On this side sit the belles, on that the beaux;
And thus, like hostile hosts in dread array,
Await the coming of the freighted tray.

The tea goes round, &mdash; they sip, and sip again,
Till rising fumes exhilarate the brain,
And broken whispers from the cautious fair,
Like distant music, float upon the air.

The service o'er, each sex apart unites
In petty groups, as choice or chance invites.
The conversation, first, is soft and slow;
More loud and quick, succeeding accents flow,
Till every voice in one harsh clamour stuns,
Like the mixt din of Babel's babbling sons.
"Exempli gratia," (that is, for example,)
Here follows, of the whole a genuine sample.

The tea is fine. &mdash; This cake is very nice.&mdash;
I'm glad you like it; take another slice.&mdash;
What is there stirring? &mdash; Nothing, sir, that's new.&mdash;
How is the weather out? &mdash; It rains a few.&mdash;
So soon divorced! &mdash; Exchange has fallen, they say.&mdash;
This cap is pretty. &mdash; What's the price of hay?
&mdash;Two ships arrived &mdash; six bride-maids &mdash; wedding cake&mdash;
Seven bales of broadcloth &mdash;shocking &mdash; such a rake!&mdash;
Ten thousand dollars &mdash; Leghorn bonnet &mdash; brandy&mdash;
Miss Flacket's ball &mdash; New England rum &mdash; a dandy&mdash;
Thirty days' passage &mdash; dances well &mdash; confined&mdash;
Brown sugars &mdash; three weeks old &mdash; a gale of wind&mdash;
Pork &mdash; muslins &mdash; Kean and Conway &mdash; salt and crates&mdash;
The newest fashion &mdash; Troup &mdash; the Southern States&mdash;
In love &mdash; engaged &mdash; at auction &mdash; dances well&mdash;
Five failures &mdash; Saratoga &mdash; quite a belle&mdash;
Molasses &mdash; baby's cap &mdash; salt fish &mdash; face veils&mdash;
At church &mdash; ball dress &mdash; pot-ashes &mdash; fifty bales&mdash;
Ice-creams &mdash; grows late &mdash; my hood and shawl &mdash; polite&mdash;
I thank you, dear &mdash; a glass of wine &mdash; good night.

In boreal climes, as learned travellers say,
Where rugged Winter reigns with tyrant sway,
Each word that's breathed, and every vocal sound,
Ere they escape, in icy chains are bound,
And driven in tempests o'er a frozen sea,
Till Spring, returning, sets the prisoners free.
Then, wondering sailors, traversing the deep,
As on the deck their nightly watch they keep,
Hear strange discourse, and words from sense disjoined,
And mingled voices, to the vacant wind.
Such were the wild and windy sounds that rose,
Confused and loud, from city belles and beaux,
When Henrietta's high-bred company,
On that proud evening, graced her rooms for tea.
