Adieu to the village delights,
Which lately my fancy enjoy'd;
No longer the country invites,
To me all its pleasures are void.

Adieu thou sweet health-breathing hill,
Thou can'st not my comfort restore;
For ever adieu my dear ville,
My Emma, alas!  is no more.

She, she was the cure of my pain,
My blessing, my honour, my pride;
She ne'er gave me cause to complain,
Till that fatal day when she died.

Her eyes that so beautiful shone,
Are closed forever in sleep;
And mine, since my Emma is gone,
Have nothing to do but to weep.

Could my tears the bright angel restore,
Like a fountain they never should cease;
But Emma, alas!  is no more,
And I am a stranger to peace.

Let me copy with fervour devout,
The virtues which glow'd in her heart;
Then soon, when life's sand is run out,
We shall meet again, never to part.
