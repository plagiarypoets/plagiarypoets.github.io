I.
Well may that Country mourn her fate,
With mis'ry prest and jealous fears;
Who, when internal evils wreck the state,
Sees Time revolve her hasty years;
Who sees her Nobles interest pursue,
Ambitious proud advance, and Slavery close the view:

II.
But happy ye, thrice happy plains!
Unaw'd, uninfluenc'd by a Noble's arm,
Where the glad farmer proudly reigns
The peaceful monarch of his little farm:
Where Democratick laws afford
No towering title to a tyrant Lord,
But peace and pleasure, smiling, bless the soil,
And he who sows enjoys the product of his toil.

III.
Wide o'er the peace-encircled plain,
Columbia's tutelary power,
(No sighs declare internal pain,
No storms upon her forehead lour)
Extends her pleasure sparkling eye,
And thus, in rapturous strains, is heard to cry:&mdash;

IV.
"O Phebus!  lash thy fiery steeds,
And hasten on revolving years&mdash;
In arts of peace, and warlike deeds,
Unrival'd, see my land appears!
Here I behold the heavenly Virtues shine,
The Muses' airy train, and Liberty divine.

V.
"Great in the cabinet, or bold in fight,
Heroes and patriots rush before my sight;
I see the pageant move along,
The pride, the glory of the Muse's song;
What patriot virtues in a Hancock meet!
Or warm the heart of Maddison! &mdash; I spy
The Lightning crouch beneath my Franklin's feet,
And Nature, pervious to my Bowdoin's eye.

VI.
"O Washington!  around thy head,
I see Minerva's aegis spread&mdash;
&mdash;Hark!  heard ye not the tuneful lay,
Flitting thro' the fields of day,
'Tis bards who hail thee from afar,
The PRIDE OF PEACE AND SHIELD OF WAR.

VII.
"Hail, happy, happy land!
None but the good and great enjoy command;
Now do my Senate throng the federal dome,
Honour and freedom there confess their home.
Lo!  arts and commerce, plenty, peace appear&mdash;
What great events now fill the rising year!
To crown with glory, brighter than the past!
This truth does Liberty declare,
And Fame with brazen trumpet swear,
'Time's noblest offspring is the last.'"
