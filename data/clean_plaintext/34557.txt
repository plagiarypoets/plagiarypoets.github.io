O Skill'd Thy every Reader's Breast to warm,
To lull with Harmony, with Sense to charm,
To call the glowing Soul into the Ear,
(And now we live and now we dye to hear,
Born on the Waves of Melody along
Exulting shout, and triumph in thy Song!)
O POPE!  the sweetest of the tuneful Race,
This votive Tablet, grateful, Here I place;
Here where the Graces sport on Laurel Hill,
Fast by the Music of the murmuring Rill.
From hence the blueish Barkshire Hills survey,
Which oft have echoed to thy sylvan Lay;
When, young, in Windsor's blissful Fields you stray'd,
Immortal by your deathless Labours made!
There the first Music trembled from thy Tongue,
And Binfield Swains on ev'ry Accent hung:
The Larks the Sweetness of thy Notes confest,
And, dumb with Envy, sunk into their Nest;
While, in soft Silence, Loddon stole along,
And list'ning, wonder'd at thy softer Song.
Nor scorn the Prospects which Oxonia yields,
Her Hills as verdant, and as fair Her Fields,
As rich Her Vallies, and Her Streams as clear,
And Phoebus haunts, and &mdash; THOU hast charm'd Us Here.
For other Busts a single Wreath I wove,
But dedicate to Thine my Laurel Grove.
