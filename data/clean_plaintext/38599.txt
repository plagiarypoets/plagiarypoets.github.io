In the days of my childhood, as sportive I play'd
Among the young lasses around,
I was fond then of laughing, my grandmother said,
None merrier ever was found;
To fill up the moments with joy and delight,
I scarcely knew what I'd be at;
Whatever was pleasing that came to my sight,
I could not help laughing at that.

Still the humour prevails, tho' maturer I'm grown,
I am happy to smile time away;
The frolicks of fancy I still make my own,
And pleasantly spin out the day:
When the dull, or the splenetic, censure or chide
At my innocent freedom and prate,
I titter to hear their nonsensical pride,
For I cannot help laughing at that.

Young Collin declares for a husband I'm fit,
So he courts me from morning to night;
On the charms of my person displays all his wit,
And I own that it gives me delight:
He talks of the parson, the church, and the ring,
In praise too of conjugal chat,
That wedlock, indeed, is an excellent thing,
So I must not get laughing at that.

At length to his wishes, if I should comply,
As at present I seem to incline,
If but on his promises I may rely,
Not to check this good humour of mine,
To church with young Collin I'd soon trip away,
And answer all questions quite pat;
When it comes to the critical word call'd OBEY,
I shall scarcely keep laughing at that.
