We ask not Ben, what's the design, did raise,
This Mausoleum, to thy flesh or bayes?
Whether to eate, to write, to drink, to shite,
To hug thy Wench, to give thy friend the right
Of entertainment, with the lusty Wine,
We scruple not, great Genius, 'tis Divine:
And though our Nation could afford no room,
Near Chaucer, Spencer, Draiton, for thy tomb;
What thou ordain'st, though for thy pleasures,
Then Pyramids or Marbles guilded o're.
Here, here thou livest, and from thy latest night,
Breakest forth into our world, with mirth and light,
Whom thus great Soule we celebrate, but first
Smile on our Liquor ere we quench our thirst:
Appease thy Horace, when he views us here,
Doing homage to thy name in Ale or Beer.
We acknowledge Ben, here shin'd Ariadne's flame,
Sack was the Morning, Evening of thy name:
Thy Herculean Muse did rage at Inigo,
With feavered flames, not with flight so low;
But since the destinies have hither hurl'd,
Thy vast contrivance with another world
Of different fate, and a still clouded Sky,
Our Fortunes cannot reach a pitch so high.
Befriend us, Ben, be kind unto us now;
Inspire thy Chair, from thy Elesian bough:
This grove of Lawrell, though at this low rate,
Let it expresse what we but imitate.
Let thy great Muse, give to our drink new birth,
Antaeus like, to lift us from the Earth;
That whatsoere we swill, carowse, or quaff,
May act thy verse, and live thy Epitaph.
