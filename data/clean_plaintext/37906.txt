Faunus, the rural power, o'er streams and shades
Who gentle reigns, dear loves Lyceus mount,
Arcadian; yet oftime the god,
For lov'd Lyceus, courts the hills

Of fair Lucretilis, and my soft flock
Guards from wet winds and Summer's fiery sun.
Free ranging thro' the peaceful grove,&mdash;
Sweet thyme they cull; and each sweet shrub

That latent lies:  nor Martian wolf, nor snake
Green spotted dread.  Perchance adown the vale
And o'er yon smooth rock, where high nods
Ustica, Faunus oaten pipe

Echoes the past'ral song.  Thus blest of heav'n,
My gentle life I lead, and sacred powers
Watch over me; belov'd my muse,
My humble piety belov'd.

Come then, O mind of beauty, for to thee
Our rural wealth, fair flowers, and nectar'd fruits,
Lavish shall flow;  whate'er with smile
Plenty from her rich horn free pours.

Here 'mid the shades that darken the lone vale,
Deep hid from burning suns, thy fingers light
In melting sounds the Teian lyre
Shall wake, and sing the rival nymphs,

Penelope, and her magic arts,
With beauties magic charms, so false and fair.
Here Lesbian wines, innoxious, pure,
Crowning the board, shall tempt thy taste.

Nor fear lest Bacchus stain his festal rite
With wild uproar and quarrel; nor yet dread
Lest the hot-blooded Cyrus dare,
(By envy stung and mean revenge)

Disturb the genial hour &mdash; with ruffian hand
Tearing the rosy crown from thy fair locks;
Nor sparing e'en th' unconscious robe
That floats upon thy graceful form.
