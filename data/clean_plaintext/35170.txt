What Chaucer sung in Woodstock's rural bow'rs,
Was marr'd by death, or Time's unsparing hand;
The Swain of Mulla next essay'd his pow'rs,
And the fair legend of Camballo plann'd.
My bark advent'rous strikes the magic strand;
The blue-ey'd Nereieds on her track attend:
She wafts the prowess'd knights of Eastern land,
Who aid the feeble arm, the fair defend,
The glitt'ring crowns from sanguine tyrants rend.
Like them, be ardent for the public weal,
Nor from the sphere of honour e'er descend,
Thy spirit pious, without bigot zeal;
May thy sun set, as rose thy early dawn;
Thy name as spotless as thy hallow'd lawn!
