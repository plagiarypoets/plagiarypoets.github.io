Come Doric Muse in rustic stole, and sing,
While I, sad mourner, melancholy stray
Thro' tangled wood-walks to the crystal spring,
Where arching sycamores obscure the day,
And from the garish sun admit no ray;
There let me wander, silent and unseen,
There let me shape my solitary way,
Absorb'd in care and pensiveness, I ween,
As e'er was loftier woe-fraught breast of kesar or of queen.

Ah!  hapless theme, it wills me while I write
To drop affection's dew from either eye,
And, as with grateful reverence I indite,
Scapes from my bosom sorrow's deep-felt sigh:
And do you anxious ask the reason why?
Would you from sympathy the cause explore?&mdash;
Tis, that my youth's fond guard, unthank'd should die,
Whose kindness almost equal'd her's who bore;&mdash;
Tis, that my school-years' village friend, Dame Morris, is no more!

But vainly I the piteous tale relate
To those unconscious of her modest worth,
For heralds ne'er were fee'd to make her great,
She could not boast a memorable birth,
Yet better soul ne'er liv'd or died on earth;
Her charity unbounded bore the sway
O'er all her actions, and in time of dearth,
She dealt with open hand such gifts away,
That poor folk wish'd her life might last for ever and for aye.

Good nature too she had, and many a time
Of all its store right mickle was the need,
For truant lads would to her fruit trees climb,
Would raze the hedge-row with untoward deed,
Or in rude sport despoil the verdant mead;
Nay, I have known these wicked wights to wait
For a snug time when none their bent could heed,
Then on the garden's wealth have stol'n ingrate,
And left but pods upon the hawm where peas had bloom'd of late:

Thinking thereby this hostile crime to hide,
By making it appear the sparrows' theft;
But evil deeds are soon or late descried,
For watchful Marian, her maiden deft,
Shew'd to the wond'ring Dame the peascods cleft:
Yet did no angry threat her voice distend,
"Tis right, she said, I claim the portion left,
While, supperless to bed, the plunderers wend,
And feast upon the pleasant dreams which on deceit attend."

Ever to virtue true, and virtuous deed,
Goodness she honour'd, poverty she fed;
From all the ills of sordid lucre freed,
No base got means her couch disquieted,
But glad content hous'd in her humble shed;
Happy with this alone, she envied not
Imperial courts where luxury is bred,
But, with her kin around, prefer'd the spot
Where Providence had long time plac'd herself and homely cot.

O!  that the world would by her ways improve,
Would shun dissimulation's serpent-cell,
Nor wear the vizor-smile of feigned loves
While cank'rous thoughts within the bosom dwell:
But let true concord envy's wiles repel;
Then would benevolence unbounded reign,
Then would simplicity be counted well,
Serenity of spirit all would gain,
Nor any churlish cynic treat my Matron with disdain.

Or, with the preacher, if at length 'tis found
That all is vanity we seek below;
Since joy's bright fane is built on fairy ground,
Which those who longest live the surest know:
Then, from this nursery of thick-sown woe,
Like her, let us each anarch passion weed,
And in its place teach fairer germs to grow,
Teach hope with resignation to succeed,
And such as may in heav'nly clime bring forth immortal seed.
