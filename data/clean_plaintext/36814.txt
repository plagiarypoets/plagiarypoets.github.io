Russell, my Friend and Patron!  while I sing
In rapturous strains, I dedicate to thee
One heartfelt tone &mdash; one humble offering;
And howso'er unworthy it may be
Of all that thou hast kindly done for me,
Still, Russell &mdash; still, my first of Friends, believe
'Tis the heart's offering in sincerity:
And, for thy sake, I'd wish the wreath I weave
To flourish fresh as flowers dipped in the dews of Eve.
