When now the Sun had usher'd in the morn,
And glitt'ring dew-drops hung on ev'ry thorn;
Beneath the shadow of a spreading beech,
TOM lean'd, and NANCY sat upon her breech.
Their bleeting lambkins wander'd down the vale,
While NANCY listen'd to the Shepherd's tale;
Their faithful dog lay sleeping by their side,
When TOM began, and NANCY thus replied&mdash;

TOM.
Believe me, NANCY!  I'd a song indite,
To chant thy praises; but &mdash; I cannot write.

NANCY.
With thee, dear TOM!  I'll range the flow'ry mead;
But write no songs &mdash; for, ah!  I cannot read.

TOM.
Well, then, we'll love, from day-light till 'tis dark,
And leave such learning to our Parish-clerk.

NANCY.
Or e'en the Parson's maid might do as well;
For she's a scholard, and can write and spell.

TOM.
And thou can'st knit and spin, and that is better;
And I can work, tho' I don't know one letter.

NANCY.
O!  that we'd learn'd to read when we were young,
And say our catikeys &mdash; and vulgar tongue!

TOM.
Well; now each child may learn in SUNDAY SCHOOLS,
And little John will make us look like fools.

NANCY.
God bless Squire RAIKES, who first those Schools did found;
To which our Gentry now give many a pound.
Now, neat and clean, poor boys and girls we meet&mdash;
Not running wild and ragged, through the street.

TOM.
Now, boys and girls are taught to read and sing,
And say their pray'rs, and pray for Church and King.
Then let us go to Church on Sunday night,
And hear them sing Sol-fa' with all their might.

NANCY.
We will, and though I cannot sing the best,
My voice, so shrill, shall squeak amongst the rest.

TOM.
But, lo!  our sheep quite out of sight are got,
And now the noon-tide Sun grows plaguy hot.

NANCY.
Then you drive up your sheep, and I'll go home,
And boil the pot, and spin till you are come.
EXEUNT.
