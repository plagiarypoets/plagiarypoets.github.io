Can I forget thee!  when the dewy earth
Laughs out with joy beneath Aurora's eye,
When the glad zephyrs sing to morning's birth,
And the huge forests wave, in ecstacy,
Their giant branches; when the azure sky
Pours floods of living splendour; when the sea
Shouts forth his matin hymn of praise on high;
When the young flow'ret opens to the bee,&mdash;
There will thine image come!  all will be full of thee.

Or when at eve, in cloudy grandeur dying,
The last broad sunbeam sheds its golden light;
When pale-eyed spirits, on starry pinions flying,
Draw o'er the earth, the deep blue veil of night;
When heaven smiles in liquid splendour bright,
And the sad moon stands trembling on the hill,
In paleness watching for her lover's flight,
Then will bright thoughts of thee my bosom fill,&mdash;
Thy name will fill the breeze and whisper from the rill!

Thou art my only hope!  Oh I have seen
All the bright visions of my boyhood fade;
The budding wreath of life no more is green,
And my heart's darkened by the dull cold shade
Of error's sunless clouds!  Oh I have made
My life one wild of deep and sad distress,
Through which no ray of happiness has played,
Save loving thee!  that in this wilderness
Could dry up all my tears, and cheer, and heal and bless.
