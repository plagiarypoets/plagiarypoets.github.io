Fond memory lingers o'er the days of youth,
Whose rays effulgent glitter in the eye,
Whose hours, like odours on the fragrant south,
Roll on beneath an ever-glowing sky;
No scene around a pleasure can deny,
To hearts which e'er with living ardour glow,
A sweet response, whose echoes never die,
To His, who claims to be adored below
By Love, the bond of life, which smooths the warring brow.

Time hides his flight from youth's enraptured view,
And seldom soars upon his raven wing,
But beams delightful burst in every hue
That charms the sight with one eternal spring;
The heart, too ardent, feels no secret sting
Rising beneath the roseous bed around,
Suspects no gale will grief, or sorrow bring,
No chords of love emit a jarring sound,
But that the fairy scene will never know a bound.

Ah!  has thine eye ne'er paused upon the dawn,
Fretting the east with grand vermilion dies?
Seen mild Aurora, by her coursers drawn,
Recede before the sun's refulgent rise?
Short was the sheeny phantom to thine eyes,
Dazzling a moment &mdash; lost in vapours dun!
So fares life's morn &mdash; the beauty man descries;
It disappears, before the eye has won
Scarce one extatic view of what it dwells upon.

Then raise thy view to heav'nly worlds on high,
Attune to strains sublime the warbling wire,
Seek views whose radiance cannot wane or die,
And cherish hope that never can expire;
So youth shall blossom o'er the tott'ring sire,
Immortal beauties wake the living strain,
Whose dulcet notes shall fan the latent fire
And spread abroad o'er Zion's golden plain,
The holy joys that spring from Love's eternal reign.
