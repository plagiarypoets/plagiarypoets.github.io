Through forest paths, o'erstrew'd with rustling leaves,
October comes, to deck the fading year;
And of its spoil a varied chaplet weaves,
Erelong to hand on pallid Autumn's bier.
The dew-drop on his brow congeals;
His golden locks the wood-blast steals;
The scattering wind his chequer'd mantle rends,
And o'er his form the tempest-cloud impends.

Pale are the flowers that thinly plant his way;
The gelid drops o'ercharge their closing bells;
Their tissued wardrobe falls in quick decay;
And nightly cold their blushing grace dispels.
Their drooping heads the frost-star gems;
The whirlwind shakes their pensile stems:
Their transient bloom they shortly must resign,
And with their relics mark the year's decline.

The purple-vested Morn her hour delays,
And lingering seems with doubtful mien to rise:
Gold-sceptered Day a shorten'd visit pays,
And Night with rave crest usurps the skies.
With early beam, the vesper star
Flames on Twilight's misty car:
And swiftly to the chambers of the West,
The crimson-curtain'd Evening sinks to rest.

In wizard forms the dusky vapours float,
And veil the woodlands in their dim disguise;
The Robin trills his solitary note,
And tunes in warbling plaint his elegies:
The orphan beauties of the year
In melancholy train appear;
Pay their last mournful tribute to its shade,
And o'er its desolated ruins fade.

For soon the wheels of Winter's icy car
Shall crush these fragments of the shatter'd year;
Ev'n now, his hollow murmurs, from afar,
Proclaim the fury of his empire drear.
The echoing blast, his herald, blows;
His meteor torch blue-tinctur'd glows;
For Nature's sleep he weaves a snowy vest,
And soon shall rock her languid frame to rest.

The curl'd leaf, flitting on the blast,
The moaning gale, the shadowy sky,
Denote the Sun's dominion past,
And shades of northern darkness nigh:
For Sirius gems the zone of night,
And, clad in giant armour bright,
Orion, Winter's sentinel, ascends,
And o'er the sleeping world his watchful light suspends.
