The fleecy clouds that skim the blue expanse,
And with the winds of heaven in dalliance go,
In the glad sun's illuminating glance
Blush the deep crimson of his setting glow:
Bright is the azure sky &mdash; the world below
Is not less beautiful; the streaming gold
Is on the hills, is on the river's flow:
Whate'er of rich Arcadia hath been told,
Lies here in beauty's tints, before mine eyes unrolled.

Hushed is the busy hum of toiling man,
And nature's voice, long drowned, is sweetly heard:
Again the river, which unmurmuring ran,
Is audible:  each merry woodland bird
Carols aloud:  the shadowy woods are stirred
To music in the wind:  and on the air
Have odorous flowers their perfumed breath conferred:
Whate'er in sound is dear, in sight is fair,
Lives here in nature's breast to calm the brow of care.
