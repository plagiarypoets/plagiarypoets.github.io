Thief of my Rhymes!  O more unpitying Thief
Than ever plunder'd from the poor Man's Store,
Robb'd the pale Widow in the hour of Grief,
Or from its Hand the Orphan's Pittance tore!
O Theft of deeper Dye than that of yore,
When Phoebus, by the Charm of Beauty led,
Like some poor Swain, Admetus' Cattle fed,
And he, the God of many Mischiefs, bore
His Songs, his Flocks, his Flute, from fair Thessalia's Shore.

Yet, hadst thou, all rapacious as thou art,
Known the long Travel that thy Bard sustain'd,
To bear these simple Children of his Heart;
How oft from youthful Pastime he refrain'd,
Some thought of Pity had, perchance, remain'd,
And left them in these lonely Shades, to chear
His pensive Moments, when December drear,
The Thief of Nature, all her Aspect stain'd
With one unvary'd Gloom, and one dull Horror reign'd.

Thief of my Rhymes!  O worse than other Thieves!
They take the paltry Goods that Fortune brought,
But this the Soul a rifled Pilgrim leaves,
And robs her of her little Hoard of Thought.
Sore is my Wrath; some Vengeance have I sought.
Tremble, ye Miscreants, that in after Times
Shall rob an angry Poet of his Rhymes,
Which he with Toil of five long Years hath bought,
Or from their dim Cell draw the Cobwebs he hath wrought.

Of that sweet Stream whose witching Draught inspires
Illusive Dreams the Woes of Life to hide,
That, lull'd a while by more than mortal Lyres,
Repose &mdash; but soon, on Fancy's ebbing Tide,
Emerge enormous, and more dreadful Ride.
That Stream, divinely dangerous, may'st thou more
And deeper drink than any Bard before;
And the long Gloom of dark December 'bide
In B&mdash;'s leafless Shades to hear a Poet chide.
