Ere Morn illumes with rosy beams
Our plains, I wake the echoes round,
And tire the woods, and vales, and streams,
With many a love-complaining sound:
While still to ease my heart's consuming pain
Echoes, and woods, and vales, and streams, alas!  are vain.

On flowery banks, where oaks arise
In shade, no more I find repose;
I sigh, the ring-dove answering sighs,
Tears swell the stream that murming flows;
But, ah!  to ease my heart's consuming pain,
Streams, woods, and vales, and echoes, all are vain.
