Press'd with a lode of woes, my wearye soul
Hangs tremlynge on the awefulle verge of tyme;
But vaine the hope that would my feares controulle,
Each moment past was stamped with a cryme:
In daies of mirthe and nights of lawelesse sport,
My tyme has fledde and made a dread report.

Though in the syren's songe sweet musicke flowe,
And harmonie through the wide halle resound;
What now remaines but shame and feare of woe,
And torturinge pangs inflyctinge deadlie wound?
O pleasure boughte too dear and earn'd too harde,
By justyce doom'd to meet its due rewarde.
