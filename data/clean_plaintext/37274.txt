How blithely roll the fleeting days of youth,
The happiest oft in this terrestrial state;
Tuition moulds the soul to virtuous truth,
Man's steadfast prop in all the storms of fate:
And when, of age, at length the ripening date
Compels him other scenes, afar, to view,
He leaves his home, his school, and each lov'd mate,
In distant lands some calling to pursue,
Warm from his heart shall burst the lingering, last adieu.

We love the play-ground of our early years,
Where oft the hours of joy unnumber'd roll,
And memory long the hallowed spot endears,
Where first instruction dawn'd upon the soul:
And now, though hope's enchanting prospects glow,
In gay prospective through the coming years,
Backward the tide of feeling still must flow,
While busy memory every room endears,
And pays to Philom's walls the tribute of her tears.

We part, and some perhaps to meet no more,
In scenes like this to pass the halcyon hours;
Culling the richest fruits of classic lore,
And twining garlands of Parnassian flowers:
And we, who still instruction's path pursue,
Within these hallowed walls no more shall meet,
Yet while we breathe the lingering, sad adieu,
Hope rises to the soul in prospect sweet,
And scenes of future joy our raptur'd fancy greet.

We see transplanted to another scene
The plant of genius we have cultur'd here,
Where health shall glow, with roseate brow serene,
And joy and hope, each beating bosom cheer.
There where St. Mathew's lifts its sacred dome,
To lure our thoughts beyond this earthly dome,
Shall science find her consecrated home,
And learning fix her permanent abode,
And lead the youthful mind to virtue, and to GOD.
