What shall I sing?  the Muse assiduous kens
All subjects canoniz'd in prose or rhyme;
And all that time, in his important chace,
Has left unnotic'd, by the Bards unsung;
Yet none attracts such high dignity
As the soft Muff, replete with every charm.
Hail, blest production!  whether of Ermine,
Otter, or of grim Grimalkin form'd, all hail!
Or com'st thou from Siberia's hateful clime,
Or from Tartarian mountains, bordering on
Great Fubi's vast domain, or from the banks
Where Beavers cities build with rampart strong
To ward off savage Man. &mdash; Come to my arms.

When angry Boreas shakes the mountain's brow,
And blustring bellows thro' the forest wide,
The flood, stagnates each wane, spreads sheets of snow,
And decks with pendant gems the leafless bough;
Then the coy Maid, Daphne, or Phillis fair,
Or Cloe, fraught with ev'ry winning grace,
Thinks of her Muff in paste-board prison pent,
Unbinds the charm, and sets her captive free.
Ah!  was my heart a Muff, I too had known
Perhaps the joys of liberty; like thee
Encircling kiss'd her lily hand, or warm'd,
Oh rapt'rous thought!  her heaving breast.  Thee, too,
The deep-read Doctor, learn'd in Paeon's page,
Prowling, pulse-feeling all the city round,
Dangles with grace, tho' death attends his step.
Nor can the Lawyer live without thy aid;
For on the awful Bench of Justice sate,
And poring o'er the devious dark debate,
He warmth and wisdom draws from thy embrace.
The Fopling too, who not for wisdom cares,
Or knows aught worthy of poetic song,
Thy aid implores, to make him Lady-like,
Or to be fine.

Nor when the ev'ning shades descend, and cards
And pale quadrille usurp the frantic mind;
Art thou, thrown by, less useful; for in thee
Grimalkin, drawn by sympathy of scent,
Or by antipathy, and rage impell'd,
(Such deed, recorded stand in Prior's page)
Shall fix to thy embrace, dilate herself
In thy capricious round, and drop her young,
To furnish more materials for the Muff.
