Sweet Echo!  sportive Nymph, that dwell'st unseen
Within thy sound-encircled cave,
Or fleeting o'er the moon-light green,
Or where the baffled billows lave;
Some lonely time-disparted tower,
Oft at evening's pensive hour,
With loitering step I muse along,
Charm'd by the many-warbling song,
Whilst Silence o'er the sleeping vale
Fearfully spreads her gos'mer veil.
Now pleas'd I mark thy softer voice
Mimic the ruder torrent's noise,
List'ning 'mid the stilly scene,
By yond' willow-waving grove,
Oft, the trembling shades between,
In fancy's eye I see thee rove
"Over the hills and far away,"
Where the dapper elves do play,
Sounding sweet thy silver shell,
'Till near some hermit's moss-grown cell
(While 'mid the mazes of the wood
Thousand responsive notes on every side are heard),
Thou rests at length thy devious flight,
Smiling on the frowning Night,
Who, jealous of her drowsy sway,
Shuns the merry harbinger of day,
And seeks &mdash; tho' sadly loath to go&mdash;
Compell'd, the Stygian shades below.
