Unhappy daughter of distress and woe,
Whate'er thy sorrows, and whoe'er thou art,
For thee the tear of charity shall flow,
Warm from the purest fountain of the heart.

Perhaps, though now neglected and forlorn,
A Parent once beheld thee with delight;
The idol of a father's heart alone,
Or the lov'd darling of a mother's sight.

For thee, perhaps, they toil'd, and watch'd, and pray'd,
O'er thy sweet innocence with rapture hung;
And well they thought their tend'rest care repaid,
To hear the artless music of thy tongue.

When dawning reason shed her ray divine,
And all thy excellence became reveal'd,
How did they see thy op'ning virtue shine!
And hear thy praise, with transport ill conceal'd!

For who, alas!  can tell thy secret worth?
What soft angelic goodness might appear?
The bosom laid defenceless on the earth,
Might once be grateful, gen'rous, and sincere!

The tongue, that knew no friend to bid farewel,
Might once the noblest sentiments express!
The wretched head, that unsupported fell,
Might once be turn'd to stories of distress!

Some base deceiver, practis'd to betray,
Might win thy easy faith, destroy thy fame;
Then throw thee, "like a loathsome weed, away,"
The sport of Fortune, and the child of Shame!

Poor wanderer!  perhaps thou could'st not find
One gen'rous hand the slender gift to spare!
Insatiate Avarice the soul confin'd,
Or timid Prudence disbeliev'd thy pray'r.

Whate'er thy lot hath been, unhappy shade!
From sin, at last, and sorrow, thou art free:
Thy debt to Virtue it is amply paid;
And weeping Pity pays her debt to thee.
