'Tis hard to wean the heart from gone by years&mdash;
Yes!  there are hours when nature must be free
And dwell upon its former hopes and fears,
And those fond dreams that never were to be,
Life would indeed be fraught with misery,
And be a weary burden to the soul,
Did we not sometimes quit this earth and flee
Unto the realms of thought &mdash; where tears will roll,
And the heart yield itself to passion's sweet control.

Let sophists fume and prattle as they may,
This heart will bleed when dwelling on the past;
The moralists lore will not then have the sway,
A tear will start, tho' it should be the last.
And wherefore not?  when feelings rushing fast
From dark oblivion's cells again to light,
Crushing each worldly thought, like fate's fell blast,
Can aught of earth or powers of endless night
Forbid the heart to mourn o'er fortune's withering blight.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Can we gaze on the silent quiet dead,
When life's warm glow has left the inanimate clay,
When from our sides the immortal spark has fled
And not exclaim &mdash; "poor beings of a day,
What are ye?  when your worldly vain display
Is past &mdash; when ye have sped into the bourne
Of dread futurity.  Not one who may
Tell this.  Say, will there be a joyful morn,
Or do ye to your parent dust for e'er return?"

But hold, thou bold presumptuous man!  How far
Would thy flight of impiety thus go?
Would thy frail heart vainly presume to war
With Him who gave thee being?  'Ware the blow
That soon will end thy doubts.  "Enough to know
Thou art."  Doth not a feeling in thy breast,
A strange pang which thou know'st not of, say "no"
To all thy sceptic thoughts? &mdash; 'Twill never be supprest.
If thou canst do't &mdash; then say there is no place of final rest.
