Waste not thy sweetness on "the desert air,"
Thou gentle maiden, with that pallid cheek;
Let hope replace the faded roses there,
And bid thine eyes their lost expression speak.
What!  though the youth has left thy love, to seek
A brighter charm, at wealth's unholy shrine,
Let not his falshood thy fond spirit break;
He was not unworthy such a heart as thine.
Let not thy fingers for the wand'rer twine
The cypress wreath, nor willow's bodeful green;
But let the garland in thy tresses shine
Fair as the hope in early visions seen,
When many gallant knee did low incline
Before the majesty of beauty's dazzling shrine.
