O!  MADNESS, thou destroying Angel! &mdash; why,
Why, in thy fatal grasp embrace my friend?
Why bid thy spectres jeer his glaring eye,
And make each once lov'd form appear a fiend,
And change each once lov'd note to agony,
And make each smile, that charm'd him once, now send
A dagger &mdash; poison'd with the hate of life&mdash;
Into his soul! &mdash; and yet, prolong the mortal strife!

And can no spell of earth dissolve thy power&mdash;
No "kindred" ties destroy thy dread embrace?&mdash;
And must thou on a brother's greeting lower,
And when a sister's beaming eye would trace
The lineaments she lov'd, &mdash; still must it cower
Beneath thy grim and joy-repelling face?&mdash;
Thou dark, and sullen minister of wrath,
Why wast thou sent on earth, to cross Life's lovely path!

Life's other evils have their antidote&mdash;
But none for thee, O MADNESS, can we find,
When Sorrow with a grievous hand hath smote
The bleeding heart, Religion comes to bind
And heal the wound; but when thy spectres float
Before the shatter'd mirrour of the Mind,
What hand, but Heaven's own hand, hath power to quell
And chain the "Legion" in their dark and gloomy cell!

I know Thee! &mdash; Childhood felt thy burning hand
Press hard and heavy on my molten brain!
Around my couch I saw my kindred stand,
Transform'd into a hideous, Gorgon train;&mdash;
I strove to smite them with my infant hand,
Till struggling nature burst the maniac's chain!&mdash;
'Twas thy dark, damned deed, vile charlatan&mdash;
Curs'd be thy fiendish soul, and stolen form of Man!

Heaven! &mdash; whatsoever ill thou send'st in wrath,
Stop not the cunning mechanism of the mind
Till death!  Leave Reason's lamp to light my path;&mdash;
When quench'd let not Life linger still behind:
Oh!  rather with thy nimble lightning scath
Me like the Patriot!  Let my spirit find
Her fiery pathway through the riven sky,
Where thy bright portals open to her home on high!
