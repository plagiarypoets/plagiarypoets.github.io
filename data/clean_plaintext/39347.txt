Enshrin'd in your bosoms of snow,
There's a sweet little cherub, my dear,
Tis Sympathy call'd, and we know
It brightens Humanity's tear.

A gift the most lovely and fair
That Heaven on mortals bestows,
It pilots the pilgrim of care,
Repulsive of sorrow and woes.

Poor pale-ey'd Distress I descried,
And Merit on Misery's bed,
By Opulence surly deny'd
A scrap of superfluous bread.

Then I saw her dove-sembled descend
To succour poor pale-ey'd distress;
Benevolence, sweetly extend
And Merit, tho' wretched, caress.

So dew-dropping dawnings of morn
Pervade Nature's mantle so dark,
Rekindle o'er landskips forlorn,
Of life and of light the warm spark.
