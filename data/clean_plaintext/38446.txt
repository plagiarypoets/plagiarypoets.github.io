Comes there not gladness in the festal wind,
From the far chambers of the sapphire west,&mdash;
Whose chainless wanderings, pure and unconfined,
Pour unseen freshness o'er the green earth's breast?
Sweetly the rose leaf startles from its rest,
As the faint whispers wander fleetly by,
How like gay childhood, by some vision blest,
When the pure soul is buoyant as the sky,
And the bright sun of peace outpours its light on high!

Song thrills amidst the grove; there matin birds
Pour their rapt melodies on glancing wing,
Sweet as the accent of pure childhood words,
When the young spirit revels in its spring:
O, do long after years such transport bring
As the frail ecstacies which youth invest:
May the sun smile as bright, or wild birds sing
Such winning music for the joyous breast,
As in that early dawn, by sadness unoppress'd!

Oh, viewless wind!  passing o'er stream and flower;
Gathering rich incense on thy hastening wing;
What a sweet murmurer of life's morning hour;
The dawning splendors of its golden spring!
Thou bearest the wood birds' voice; the strains they sing
Come, as a rill's sweet prattling to my ear;
How my soul turns to clasp the dreams they bring!
Alas!  they wither as the waning year;
Oh, fragrant wind of earth, why art thou lingering here?
