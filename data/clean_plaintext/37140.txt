While lost to all her former mirth,
Columbia, weeping, bends to earth,
And seeks her Hero's grave&mdash;
Whilst stain'd with blood, she strives to tear,
Unseemly, from her fragrant hair
The wreaths that Summer gave.

The thoughts that musing Pity pays,
And fond Remembrance loves to raise
Shall on her steps attend;
Still Fancy to herself unkind,
Awakes to grief the soften'd mind,
And paints the bleeding friend.&mdash;

By Hudson's broad descending wave
Her ceaseless tears bedew the grave,
Where HAMILTON is laid&mdash;
That sacred spot, with cypress crown'd,
Shall jealous Honour watch around,
And Truth protect the shade.

O'er him whose doom thy virtues grieve,
Aerial forms shall sit at eve,
And bend the pensive head;
And fall'n by fate's severe command,
Imperial Honour's awful hand
Shall point his lowly bed.

The warlike dead of ev'ry age,
Who fill the fair recording page,
Shall leave their sainted rest&mdash;
And half reclining on his spear,
Each wond'ring chief by turns appear
To hail the blooming guest.

Great WASHINGTON unknown to yield;
MONTGOMERY, from Abram's field&mdash;
Shall gaze with fix'd delight:
Again their Country's wrongs they feel;
Again they snatch the gleaming steel,
And wish the avenging fight.

But lo!  where sunk in deep despair,
Her garments torn, her bosom bare,
Impatient FREEDOM lies!
Her matted tresses madly spread,
To ev'ry sod which wraps the dead,
She turns her joyless eyes.

If weak to sooth thy soften'd heart,
These pictur'd glories nought impart
To dry thy constant tear;
If yet in Sorrow's distant eye,
Expos'd and pale thou see'st him lie,
Where Greenwich Shades appear.

Where'er from time thou court'st relief,
The Muse shall still with social grief,
With thee her vigils keep:
Ev'n VERNON'S lone sepulchral vale
Shall learn the sad respected tale,
Where sainted relics sleep.
