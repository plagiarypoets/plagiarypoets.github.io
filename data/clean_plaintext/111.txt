Wrong'd, yet not daring to express my Pain,
To you (great Lord) the Causer of my Care,
In cloudy Tears my case I thus complain
Unto your self, that only privy are:
But if that any Oedipus, unware,
Shall chance, through power of some divining Spright,
To read the Secret of this Riddle rare,
And know the Purport of my evil Plight,
Let him be pleased with his own Insight,
Ne further seek to glose upon the Text:
For grief enough it is to grieved Wight,
To feel this fault, and not be further vext.
But what-so by myself may not be shown,
May by this Gnat's Complaint be easily known.
