Sweet Hellas' earth &mdash; my fancy's fairy-land&mdash;
My youthful spirit's glorious paradise!
Oh!  who may tell how dear the filial band
Which links to thee one born in distant skies,
But with a soul that shares thy destinies,
And feels thy glory, as it felt thy shame?
That I have lived to see thy star arise&mdash;
Thy banner spread for freedom and for fame&mdash;
Land of my love!  will be a thought to claim
A long proud record in my memory,
Where the prophetic echoes of thy name
Speak all of glad and golden days to be:&mdash;
I hear the omen, as thy warriors heard,
Before the fight, the wings of Victory's bird!
