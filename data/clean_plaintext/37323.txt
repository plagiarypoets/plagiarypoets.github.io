SANDY.
Speak, dowie Shepherd, gif I'm nae mista'en,
Griefs fair to thole your honest bosom pain:
For since I on TAY'S bonny banks ha'e been,
I've watch'd your ruefu' looks, and tearfu' een;
Row'd in your plaid, ye downa bear to hear
The sounds o' joy, whilk ilka bosom cheer.
The blythsome shepherd's pipe &mdash; the canty sang,
Gi'es ye na heart to join the youthfu' thrang;
Your dog and pipe ly silent by your side,
And o'er the hills your flocks stray far and wide.

DAVIE.
Oh!  friendly stranger, ye but guess o'er true;
My saul is bris'd 'neath griefs that's kent to few.
Now dead to ilka joy, for me in vain,
The spring wi' roses cleids the smilin' plain;
The lads and lasses gambol on the green,
And in ilk place the face o' mirth is seen.

SANDY.
How vain ay, thus, wi' dool and grief to pine,
And a' the sweets o' life and nature tine!
Enough o' this; gie's on your pipe a spring;
Gif ye will play, I'll do my best to sing.

DAVIE.
My saul is out o' tune; &mdash; gif I wad play,
The sounds o' sorrow wadna match your lay.

SANDY.
You're a' mista'en; I've aft heard sorrow sung,
The tear o' wae, frae the sad bosom wrung,
I've aften seen &mdash; Sae ye may sing or play,
And a' the sorrows o' your saul display.

DAVIE.
Ance in a day the sweetest joys were mine,
And, fool's I was, I thought they ne'er wad tine.
Then ilka hill and dail, and grove bloom'd fair;
But they hae tint their bloom, for now nae mair
My MARY gies them a' their sweets and charms;
Nae mair her smile my cauldrife bosom warms.

SANDY.
Joys, tho' they're gone, may, like the ruddy morn,
Return, dispel ilk cloud &mdash; a brighter form
Gie ilka thing. &mdash; I've seen wi' sorrow clad
The face o' wae, and soon that face look glad.
To you thae dowie plains may yet look gay;
You yet may join the shepherd's blythsome lay;
Wi' them ance mair your MARY may appear;
Her smiles may yet your cauldrife bosom cheer.

DAVIE.
Lang did I woo my MARY'S virgin love;
Witness ilk gowan brae, and shady grove,
Where aft she's heard my sigh, my plighted vow,
To constant love and sacred friendship true.
'Fore a' the youthfu' shepherds tall and clean,
Wha sang her praise, or watch'd her modest een,
She me prefer'd &mdash; Oh sad, oh luckless choice,
To lo'e a wretch, who poison'd a' her joys!

SANDY.
Your MARY lo'ed ye; she may lo'e ye still;
And you may yet wi' joy her bosom fill.

DAVIE.
That MARY was nae true to me, I ween'd;
Sair did I blame her, and miscaw'd my friend.
Oh sad mistake, for whilk I've dearly paid!
My friend is gane, and tint's for ay the maid.
Far frae thae bonny fields my flocks I drave,
Whare EARN'S stout aiks their bonny branches wave.
Love brought me back; but MARY was na' mair,
Nor SANDY near, to ease my dool and care.
Say, kindly stranger, did ye never see
Whare MARY lies?  Gif sae, then come wi' me.
Down whare the burn winds round a flow'ry mead,
A blasted yew waves o'er the silent dead;
A little stane just marks her lonely grave,
Green grows the turf &mdash; the rose and lillies wave
On it their blossoms, like my MARY fair,
Sweet, short-liv'd emblems o' her beauties rare.
Gif ye can sing o' sorrow, then I'll hear;
But sound o' joy maun nae mair strike my ear.
Sing not o' hope; ye canna wake the dead,
Nor to thae fields again my SANDY lead.

SANDY.
Ance mair I'll sing, and ye, ance mair, maun hear,
The sound o' joy shall please my DAVIE'S ear.
Know MARY lives, and it's your SANDY sings;
To you, your friend both peace and gladness brings.
To try your love, I tald to ilka ane
The story o' her death. &mdash; The little stane
I plac'd mysell, and on the turf the flowers,
Fair as e'er kepp't the dew or falling showers.
She thus conceal'd, and I in this disguise,
Ha'e watch'd your tears, and seen your sorrows rise;
But now convinc'd &mdash; dress'd forth in a' her charms,
Your MARY comes, to bless her shepherd's arms.
