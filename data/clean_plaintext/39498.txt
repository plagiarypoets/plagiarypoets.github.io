'Twas eve and the welkin look'd clear,
The lambkins in wantonness stray'd;
I mus'd on the charms of my dear,
Lain pensively under a shade:
A dove on a neighbouring spray,
Perch'd, mournfully wailing its mate;
I mark'd all the notes of its lay,
So nearly resembling my fate.

My Tray he lay faintly behind,
And mark'd ev'ry change in my look;
Alas!  were my fair half so kind,
I'd willingly handle my crook:
You'll say the comparison's vain,
But O!  were your tortures like mine?
My reason is lost thro' my pain,
In deep disappointment I pine.

Now Sol's bright career was adown,
Bland Zephyrus cool'd all the air;
The hum of the neighbouring town,
Bespoke them dissolving their care:
I drove home my flock to their field,
And thought that I penn'd them secure;
But ah!  with what shame I unfold,
I left them devoid of all cure.

I play'd on my pipe through my grief,
And thought that I'd banish dull care;
In music find ease and relief,
Or humming some fav'rite air;
My accents were lost in the strain,
My lays they spontaneously flow'd,
And move most melodiously plain,
To the charms of the fair one I lov'd.

Ye shepherds no more to the plains,
Beware how ye wander or stray,
Such woes there await upon swains,
Who whilom were sprightly and gay:
The graces combine in their maids,
To move the most obdurate heart,
'Twas innocent haunting those shades
Of Cupid, I first felt the smart.

No more I frequent the sweet groves,
Where at morn such fragrance arose,
I shun to hear cooing the doves,
It renews all the pangs of my woes;
I  for e'er bid adieu to the fair,
How fair and how constant they be,
One only engross'd all my care,
But me she thought proper to flee.
