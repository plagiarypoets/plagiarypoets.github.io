O lovely, tender flow'ret of the morn,
The fairest rose of flower-bespangled May;
What gentle smiles thy blooming free adorn,
In youthful freshness innocently gay.
Here, while along these grassy banks I stray,
Rememberance wakes thee in my feeling breast:
And with affection's warmly melting lay,
My heart steals after thee in peace to rest;
And, knit with thy sweet soul, to live with rapture blest.

How oft we wander'd through the fields of spring,
And gather'd golden fruit in baskets fair,
And heard the thrilling red-breast carolling
Its notes of joy, which pierced the scented air;
And when on beds of crimson roses there,
Where beechen trees had form'd a colling shade,
While curling ringlets of soft auburn hair
Were o'er thy face in loveliest form display'd,
We read the pleasing tales which Shakspeare child of nature, made.

O those were hours of bliss, divinely sweet,
Too dear to linger long in this dark vale of woe;
Hours which like morning dews will swiftly fleet,
And but the loved remembrance ling'ring show;
So short-lived is delight while here below!
Yet since I left thee, kindest sister, dear,
And kiss'd thy melting lips with rapture's glow,
Oft to my musing mind will bright appear
That soul-felt hour, and draw a swelling, heart-shed tear.
