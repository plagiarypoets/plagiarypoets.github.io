ROGER.
Well nibour Simon, are you here you're lane,
Lean in your back against a cauldriff stane?
An' whistlin' by December's dolesome day,
Now Phoebus an' the Spring's no' far away?

SIMON.
Forsooth am I, Roger, my honest frien'
What's this you're gain?  an' fu' a' sin the streen?
May be ye're thinkin' me like mony mae,
Whase lips are gladsome, while their heart is wae,
Na, Roger, man, whan a' thing's right within,
The scawls o' fortune are no' worth a grin.
Clad in my plaid, my heart's as fu' o' chear
As laird, or lord, that silk an' sattin wear.
For quite contentit, man, wi' this ly the bield,
What greater pleasure cou'd a palace yield?

ROGER.
It's well wi' you; but, Simon, had you been
Wi' me last night, you'd sing anither teen.

SIMON.
The Lord watch o'er's!  is a' thing right at hame?
You're either no' your sel', or in a dream.
Has ony harm come o'er the barn or byre?
Has young, or auld forfamish'd in a myre?
Upo' your tongue dwells some unchancy tale,
What ails you, Roger, man, to look se pale?
What pickle's this you're in?  your pobrach pow
Is a' gain o'er wi' feathers, caff an' tow.
You're just like ane new risen. &mdash; Syne your looks,
Wad gluff a minister wi' a' his books.
Speak, man, ye fanna need to ax me twice,
As far as I ca do, or yet advise.

ROGER.
We're a' right sober on't my trusty frien',
A wierd-wife took her lodgin' here the streen;
Mang ither things, daft Robbie bad her spae,
Whither it was to us for weel or wae,
That laird an' lord, an' wight o' less renown,
In bodies met, in ilka burrows-town?
An' when wi might expect this ugly stour,
Between this place an' Irlan' eans be o'er?

SIMON.
Well, Roger, man what mair?  for never yet,
Cou'd I imagin' what about they met.
Some say, the hills that drink up a' the rain,
Are said to be made level wi' the plain.
An' wondrous to be tauld!  when that's a' done,
A ladder's to be made to reach the moon.
An some aledge they're gain to raise a law,
To equal trade.  Sic fowks I never saw!
But ithers think (may heaven all ill forefeind)
That this sad warld is near hand at an end.
But, man, I long the wierd-wife's tale to ken.

ROGER.
Let never mortel hear the like like agen!
She says the time, the frightsome time's at hand,
When Brit' and Irish, ever mair maun stand
On equal foot, as ty'd wi' the same band.
Or mony a lass her lemmon lost shall mourn,
An' blood rin o'er the banks o' mony a' burn.

SIMON.
That's wondrous, Roger!  had she here an end?

ROGER.
Na, man, I fear she's sister to some fiend!
When this was o'er, she took's a' to the green,
Syne, turnin' up hir wild unwardly een;
She goodlied out, that in the lift she saw,
Irlan' wrestling 'gainst Britannia;
Lords against Commons, Commons against king,
English and Irish, down by turns each fling.
She said, she saw the Magna Charta flame,
Wi' ither sights, that makes me quake to name!
Shapes brinnin' like the light'ning thro' the air,
Carryin' English commerce to the Irish fair.
She swore, she saw, till moon an' stars wi' fright,
Or sunk into the sea, or vanish'd out of sight.

SIMON.
Wonder o' wonders!  Roger!  without threap,
You make the flesh on a' ma' banes to creap.

ROGER.
Wi a' came in right eery wi' the fright,
An' Elspy fainted when she saw the light.
Syne clappin' baith her hands, cry'd lack a day!
Ise spin na' mair, Mag, take ma rock away.
What need a' spin for ither fowks to wear,
Perchance wi' may no live anither year.
I own the wierd-wife's says I dinna like,
Bit held my peace, an' sat as dumb's a tyke.

SIMON.
Well, Roger, you did right, I hinna skeel,
O fowks wha lig o'er mickle wi' the deal.
Trust a' to heaven, gif commerce gae awa,
Bid God gae wi't, I dinna care a straw.

ROGER.
But bide ye, Simon, till ye hear the rest,
This morn, e'er light began to spring the east,
To town gaed Will Daniel, to smell out,
What main intent their honours met about.

SIMON.
An' here comes Daniel trodgin up the hill,
I'll pawn my lugs the lad has had a gill.
Well honest birky!  are you eans get hame!
We're grinnin' man, to hear what sort a' game,
The lads ha' been about.&mdash;

DANIEL.
&mdash;Ah!  had your tongue,
'Twill soon be o'er well kent by auld an' young.

SIMON.
Speak Daniel, speak, an set our hearts at ease,
Whan will this ugly collishangie cease?
Is Dod, God bless 'im, nye to wear the crown?
Is Berwick still to be a burrows town?
Then callents, let us now while we're alive,
An' ill may a' king Geordy's en'mies thrive!

ROGER.
Whisht, Simon, had your tongue, an' dinna ban,
We're o'er lang i' this warld, ay are we man!
'Twere better to be five feet under ground,
Than left to wither &mdash; Daniel, how di' they sound?

DANIEL.
Sound nighbour!  thin here's the very thing,
The fouwks ha' ritten latters to the king,
A' sworn by blood an' ownds, wi' might and main,
To make Britannia mistress o' her ain.

SIMON.
Heye, Danny, lad!  an' are wi' still to kep,
Our shops and commerce firm by the grip;
But, harkee, lad.  O now but a' be glad,
Our nibours ha' the spounk, na to part wi' their trade.

ROGER.
Onward wi'll wawk till doomsday, arm in arm!
An' live aboon the dread o' warldly harm.
