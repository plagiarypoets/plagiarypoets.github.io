'Twas at the dark, the solemn hour,
When midnight throws its gloom around,
When the deep-frowning tempests lour,
And the shrill-whistling winds resound
Along the forest drear, and o'er the lonely grave;
When even the courage of the brave
Sinks 'neath the pressure of the sullen shade,
When the heart's deceitful visions fade&mdash;
Visions of bliss by mortals never known,
Since virtue from the earth had flown,
And anger bar'd his blood-distilling blade;
Lone I wander'd by the tomb,
Where a wretch, who, with his keen-edg'd knife,
Loos'd the bands that bind the soul to life,
And plung'd himself in misery's deepest gloom,
Slumber'd in sleep of death profound;
Which shall ne'er awake,
Till the earth's last trumpet cleaves the solid ground.

A grisly spectre met my staring sight,
Dim as the purple meteor of the night,
In robe of gory crimson clad;
His clotted hands were smear'd with red,
His eye-balls roll'd in frenzy mad,
His hollow voice seem'd issuing from the dead.

"Shun the gloomy thought, that loves to prey
On the heart, and eats the soul away,
If you dread a living hell,
Nor with misery love to dwell."

He said &mdash; and from the tomb
Three yells, like Hyaens rushing on their prey,
Burst their rapid way.
It seem'd as if the womb,
Of those eternal realms of woe and pain,
Where agonizing demons reign,
Had cleav'd its iron walls again.
Soon he vanish'd from my eye,
In a show'r of blood that stained the sky.
Dreadful was the sight
Of that lonely night,
Now in ebon darkness veil'd,
Now with crimson overspread;
So dreadful, that the stoutest heart had quail'd,
And even the undaunted brave in breathless terror fled.
