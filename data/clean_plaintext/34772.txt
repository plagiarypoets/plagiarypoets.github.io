AIR.
Hence!  avaunt!  'tis patriotic ground;
The steady paths of freedom let us keep;
No ministerial agent will be found
Hardy enough to enter here, &mdash; to peep.

CHORUS.
Celestial Liberty now walks her round,
Hence!  avaunt!  'tis patriotic ground.

RECITATIVE.
From yon high realms of Empyrean day,
Wrapt in celestial robes, and hand in hand,
E'en Sydney's self, bends from his fear sublime,
And shakes his head, and listens to our rhime.
What is all the pomp and pow'r,
Which the Great so much admire;
Should Liberty e'er quit our shore,
Magna Charta's set on fire.

AIR.
Ye brown o'er-arching roof,
To best Virginia-proof,
Where Politicians chit chat with delight,
Oft at midnight hour,
You've seen us strut this floor,
And sagely set our blundering Statesmen right.

RECITATIVE.
Let us drink to G&mdash;n's fall,
With the K&mdash;es that haunt Whitehall.
Scorning th' arts of each Court elf,
'Founded on honour, Wilkes is still himself.'

AIR.
Rejoice, ye Capadosians, rejoice,
Rear up your noses high, exalt your voice;
The voice of freedom, and on ev'ry tongue,
Let strains of Liberty in thund'ring peals be rung.

GRAND CHORUS.
Oh!  Diddledo, Diddeldo, Diddledolarey!
See a Chief Justice exalted in Airey.
