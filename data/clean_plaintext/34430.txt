COLIN.
Fair is thy Chloe, Daphnis!  all agree,
But outward Charms can never conquer me.
Eliza's Soul replete with every Grace,
Adds double Lustre to her lovely Face,
Tho' on her Cheek the dimpled Smile is seen,
Yet Prudence spreads an Awe thro'out her Mien;
In Life's each Act, to Virtue's Laws subdu'd,
Free yet not light, tho' modest not a Prude;
All must admire, none ever could upbraid
The faultless Conduct of my Sloe-eye'd Maid.
