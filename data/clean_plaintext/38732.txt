The Summer was over, my Flocks were all shorn,
My Meadows were mow'd, and I'd hous'd all my Corn,
Fair Phillida's Cottage was just in my View,
A wooing I went &mdash; I had nought else to do.
On Flora's soft Sopha together we sat,
And spent some long Hours in amorous Chat;
I told her I lov'd her, and I hop'd she lov'd too,
Then kiss'd her sweet Lips &mdash; I had nought else to do.

She hung down her Head and with Blushes reply'd
I'll love you, but first you must make me a Bride;
Without Hesitation I made her a Vow
To make her my Wife &mdash; I had not else to do.
To the Village in Quest of a Priest did we roam,
By Fortune's Decree the grave Don was at home;
I gave him a Fee to make one of us two,
He married us then &mdash; he had nought else to do.

E'er since we've been happy, with Peace and Content,
Nor tasted the Sorrows of those who repent;
Our Neighbours all round us we love, and 'tis true
Each other beside! &mdash; when we've nought else to do.
With Phoebus the Toil of the Day we begin,
I Shepherd my Flock, while she sits down to spin;
Our Cares thus domestic we'll arduous pursue,
And ever will love &mdash; when we've nought else to do.
