Unjust defamer of a gen'rous  youth,
False to the sacred confidence of love,
To say that Thyrsis wrong'd with doubt my truth,
And pray'd thy arts, my passion's strength to prove.
To prove a faithful heart he long had known,
Fix'd by the noblest ties to him alone.

A thousand dear occasions have display'd
The pure effusions of a lasting fire;
And oft has gentle Thyrsis fondly said,
He knew my flame would but with life expire.
Then can I think, with mean dissembling art,
He sought thy frauds to practice on my heart.

When languid sickness chac'd his rosy hue,
And dim'd the lustre of his radiant eyes,
Still was my aching breast to Thyrsis true,
And seem'd e'en more his fading charms to prize:
Nor could the slaving victims of thy rage,
Tho' lost their auburn beauty, less engage.

Ah!  well I know what first provok'd thy spite
And made my Thyrsis early feel thy pow'r,
&mdash;Where bless'd with him I heeded not thy slight,
And in his absence loath'd each tardy hour.
This made his tresses dear thy vengeful sway,
This brought thy snows on manhood's blooming May.

But try thy utmost, tyrant!  to debase
The various graces of that wond'rous form;
Let deep indentures mark his lovely face,
And youth's bold tide his veins no longer warm;
Till thou canst sully his angelic mind,
Love's rosy charms will still my bosom bind.
