For ages past, a tow'ring oak had stood,
The pride and beauty of a neighb'ring wood;
The ivy round its trunk was fast entwin'd,
Together ev'ry day fresh branches bind.
On earth, being felled, the oak constrain'd to lie,
The ivy also seem'd to droop and die;
Its branches torn and with'ring, for awhile
Nothing appear'd its loss to reconcile.
But grief subsides, and after some few days
The ivy seems its drooping head to raise;
Then stretch'd afar, behold it in its pride,
It finds another oak, and climbs its side.
