What youth, with odours breathing sweet,
Enamour'd PYRRHA, of thy charms,
In rosy bower, a lov'd retreat,
Enfolds thee in his wanton arms?
For whom so simply neat, thy golden hair,
Dost thou in ringlets bind, and braid with nicest care?

How oft, he shall deplore,
Betray'd by love his easy youth,
And tell the Gods, by whom you swore,
Of broken vows, and alter'd truth,
How oft on love's smooth sea with dread surprise,
Hear the loud tempest howl, and view the angry skies!

Who raptur'd now enjoys thy charms,
And fondly trusts they ne'er will fail,
Secure of love's approaching harms,
Unconscious of the changing gale;
While I escap'd from wreck, and safe on shore,
Smile at the faithless winds, and distant billows roar.
