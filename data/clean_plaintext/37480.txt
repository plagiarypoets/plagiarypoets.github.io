Mild beam of heav'n, thou daughter of the dawn,
Come from thy eastern chambers; thy moist lips
Health's purest spirit breathe,
And on thy cheek the rose
Of health perennial blooms:  O deign inspire
A song which borrows all its hues from thee;
Of simple colouring all,
Like the young blooms of spring
When their soft foliage bursts the swelling buds,
And like thy flowing tresses unconfin'd,
In numbers wildly free,
Salutes thy smiles serene;
Fled are the shades of night, in what retreat
Shall we await them at the hour of noon?
In woods, in vallies deep,
And in the clefts of rocks;
They fled 'ere yet the golden sun had ris'n
Over the ocean-wave, when hov'ring mists
Disclos'd the grey-grown oaks,
That skirt the village green.
For when thou com'st, O Morn, as thou art wont,
Veil'd in heav'ns azure robe, which fairy Spring
With curious fingers wove
Of mingled blooms and flow'rs,
Nature delighted smiles; a voice is heard
Of gratulation through her wide domain,
From ev'ry living thing
That moveth on the earth,
Or wings sublime the liquid element,
Or in the beds of ocean dwells unseen,
Where huge Leviathan
Embroils in sport the deep;
The floods rejoice; hills, woods and vallies ring;
With universal shout, they clap their hands,
And from a thousand shores
Return the solemn hymn:
The birds their quire apply, and pour their throats
In strains of warbl'd minstrelsy, deep-felt,
When to their untaught lay
The list'ning heart attends:
Now while the sun climbs up the steep of heav'n,
Behold the prospect brighten!  wood and lawn,
Grey tow'r and airy cliff
Emerge, and rustic fane,
And distant villa bosom'd deep in trees;
While thro' the laughing air a radiance waves
Of sun-beams that with gold
Illume the village spire.
Now to some eminence, whence wide around
The various colour'd country lies effus'd,
Oft hies the impassion'd youth
Whom hallow'd genius fires
With warm poetic pencil to express
The breathing landscape, while an unskill'd muse
In sylvan shades conceal'd
Designs this simple wreath
To braid thy flowing tresses, meek ey'd morn,
And tries his Doric reed with weak essay,
Thou not unfavoring deem
Of his unpractic'd song.
