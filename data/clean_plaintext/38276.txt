Think not, good Sir, the muses lay,
Shall unregarded pass away,
Like Cibber's birth-day odes;
Supported by th' inspiring power,
Above the vulgar tribe she'll soar,
Immortal, as the gods.

Tho' Spencer's praise is still compleat,
And Milton claims the highest seat,
Among the sons of fame;
The world shall honour Dryden's verse,
And Pope's delightful strains rehearse,
While flows the silver Thame.

Old Chaucer in a barb'rous age,
Warm with a true poetic rage,
Could over time prevail,
And ev'ry Wiltshire swain shall praise,
The bard who made well-meaning lays,
And sung them to his flail.

Mira still shines in Granvil's lays,
And Sacharissa's pride and praise,
In Waller's page shall last;
While many an equal beauteous dame,
Without a bard to sing her name,
Into oblivion's cast.

Immortal Marlbro' and Eugene,
The hero's of great Anna's reign,
Were hero's not alone;
The world would other chiefs revere,
Did poets in their cause appear,
To make their merits known.

When resting in the silent grave,
What differ cowards from the brave,
Except the voice of fame?
O gen'rous Townshend, then excuse
The efforts of a grateful muse
To celebrate thy name.

When Britain's int'rest calls to war,
You draw the sword, devoid of fear,
Intrepid, yet serene;
Not vainly rais'd amid success,
Not meanly drooping with distress,
You keep the golden mean.

A foe declar'd to fraud and guile,
And bribes (the bane of Britain's isle!)
You, like a patriot stand,
Rewarding worth where'er it lies,
And combat knavery and vice,
With an unsparing hand.

The master of a vast estate,
Who prides himself in heaps of plate,
Is not compleatly blest;
But he who freely from his store,
Relieves the stranger and the poor,
And gives the aged rest.

Who honour more, than life, esteems,
And worse than death or bondage deems,
Detraction and deceit,
By virtue bound his blood will spend,
To serve his country or his friend,
That man is truly great.
