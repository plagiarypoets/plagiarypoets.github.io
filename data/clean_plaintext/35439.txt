By strangers left upon a lonely shore,
Unknown, unhonour'd, was the FRIENDLESS DEAD:
Nor child to weep, nor widow to deplore,
There ever came to his unburied head!
All from his lonely habitation fled;
Nor will the lanthern'd fisherman at eve
Launch on that water by the Witches' Tower,
Where Hellebore and Hemlock seem to weave
Round its dark vaults a melancholy bower
For Spirits of the Dead, at night's enchanted hour!

They dread to meet thee (poor unfortunate!),
Whose crime it was, on life's unfinish'd road
To feel the step-dame buffeting of Fate,
And render back thy Being's heavy load!
Ah!  once, perhaps, the social Passions glow'd
In thy devoted Bosom; and the Hand
That smote its kindred Heart might yet be prone
To deeds of Mercy!  Who can understand
Thy many Woes, poor Suicide unknown!&mdash;
He who thy sorrows gave shall judge of thee alone!
