Come hither, my fair child, and let me kiss
Thy rosy lips, steep'd in their morning dew;
And on thy brightness gazing, taste that bliss
A mother feels, when on her raptur'd view
Each beauty riper grows; the graceful hue
Of health sits blushing on thy tender cheek,
And in the azure of thine eye's soft blue
Float forms of joy, such as I hope to seek
In all thy future days:  a hope how frail and weak!

Ah, no! &mdash; the current of thy after-years
Can never flow so pure as at its spring;
But in its silent progress downward, fears
Will mingle too, and all their wormwood bring.
I trembling think Affliction's deepest sting
May pierce thy soul, when she, around whose form
Thy little arms in playful fondness cling,
Can offer thee no more her bosom warm
To solace all thy woes, and shield thee from the storm.

That rose &mdash; queen of the blooming coronal
Of wild flowers waving in thy golden hair&mdash;
Behold how soon its robes of damask fall,
And cease to shed their perfume on the air,
Leaving the parent tendril lone and bare!
Alas!  the ills which wait thee in life's scene
May in that flower their darken'd emblems bear,
When blighted hopes of joy, with pangs unseen,
Blanch thy young virgin cheek, and steal its ripen'd sheen!

My yearning heart in melancholy doom
Itself with fancied agony is rending;
Let me no longer o'er such frenzies brood,
But watch thee, my sweet love, whilst lowly bending,
Thou lispeth forth thy morning prayer &mdash; and blending
With thy bright upward glance such radiance mild,
It seems as if in thee from heav'n descending
(Fair Iris of my life!) an angel smil'd,
And whisper'd peace, and joy &mdash; Oh!  thou art safe, my child!
