'Twas winter; and except a leaf
Yet trembling here and there,
December, icy-handed thief,
Had stript the forest bare.

Its tawny foliage strown around,
And silver'd o'er with sleet,
Profusely carpeted the ground,
And rustled to my feet;

When 'mid the solitary scene,
A rustic seat I sought,
And pensive, yet devoid of thought,
Indulg'd a moral thought.

An aged oak with ample head,
And arms extended wide,
Part living, shiver'd part, and dead,
Rose tow'ring by my side.

A hoary rime its branches grac'd,
Resembling most a beard;
While, clasping its gigantic waist,
An ivy green appear'd.

Its rev'rend aspect fixt my eye;
I felt a pleasing awe;
A ruminating reverie,
Inspir'd by what I saw:

When Fancy, whose creative power
Can give to trees a tongue,
And furnish from their mystic lore
"A sermon or a song,"

Employing all her magic here,
Gave language to an oak;
Which, thus admonishing my ear,
Intelligibly spoke:&mdash;

Vain mortal!  wherefore dost thou come,
My nakedness to see?
Why leave a comfortable home,
To moralize on me?

All rifled as I am and torn,
To taunt me com'st thou here?
Or dost thou come, with me to mourn
The exit of the year?

Whate'er thy motive, mortal, take
Instruction from a tree,
And condescend for once to make
Comparison with me.

If honour, join'd to length of days,
Thou fondly would'st obtain,
Behold an object that pourtrays
At once, and proves them vain!

For monarch of the woods am I,
The mightiest of my name;
A monarch, not by courtesy,
But by a prouder claim.

Two cent'ries round their circles roll'd,
Ere I attain'd my prime;
Another, ere I waxed old,
Was register'd by Time.

Surviving still, though wounded strong,
I brave the wintry blast;
And many a man in years now young,
Will not behold my last.

Yet he whose all-destroying stroke
Lays men and forests low,
Will level me! &mdash; No more it spoke,
But ended with a bow.

"Will level me!"  My muse records
The language o'er again;
"Will level me!"  Emphatic words!
Nor altogether vain.

For, musing as I homeward turn'd,
I own it humbled me,
To think that I might lie inurn'd
Ere fell this arged tree.
