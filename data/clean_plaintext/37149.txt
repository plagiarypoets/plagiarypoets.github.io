MORNING.
As from the glowing East upsprings the beam
The clear blue arch with warmth and light to fill,
Rock, grove, and tow'r, reflected from the stream
Shew Earth's fair pictures touch'd with heav'nly skill;
Roll'd, thin and fleecy, o'er the western hill,
The yielding mist in radiance melts away:
The dew-drops on the leaf hang bright and still,
So soft the zephyrs through the foliage play!
In Youth thus upward darts the mental ray;
The clear ideas so defin'd evolve,
And, gradual fading from the glowing day,
The tender mists of Infancy dissolve.
So pure the feelings of a Dawn like this,
That ev'n its sorrows seem allied to bliss.

NOON.
The summer sun, in proud meridian height,
Gives Nature's features, strong, distinct, and clear,
And insect myriads, in his fervid light,
On glittering wing pursue their gay career.
Now ardent rays, from river, fen and mere,
The steamy vapours viewlessly exhale;
But soon low congregating clouds appear,
And round the still horizon slowly sail.
The thunder rolls; &mdash; cool breathes th' electric gale;&mdash;
From lowering darkness, with convulsive jar,
Bursts the near flash, and through the frighted vale
Spreads loud and wild the elemental war.
Yet far more wild, rage pride, ambition, strife,
When passion's storms convulse the Noon of life!

EVENING.
I mark'd the westward orb's departing blaze,
While spires and turrets, magnified and bright,
As o'er the valley pour'd the purple haze,
Seem'd floating glorious on a sea of light:
But as I gazed the vision vanish'd quite;
Swift faded all the splendors of the scene;
And yet, methought, reluctantly the night
Veil'd the fair landscape in her shroud serene.
Ah!  transient as that purple light, I ween,
The golden dreams of genius or of fame,
That oft, in meteor brightness, intervene
To gild life's evening clouds with lambent flame.
But memory and affection yet may give
The magic touch that bids the Picture live.
