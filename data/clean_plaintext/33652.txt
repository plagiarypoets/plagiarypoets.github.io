That time of Year when th' Earth grand Parent shews;
Doth beauties choice, new flaunting Brood disclose:
When paints her Cheek, with Gems adorn'd (as 'twere)
Imbroidered Garb; may Curtisan appear:
Whilst, more advanc'd, the Sun with wanton eye,
Much fonder ray doth Court her from the Sky,
Smiling in Beams:  when spruce-drest Groves abound;
Thro chirping Consorts noise withal resound,
Sweet Songs of joy:  Heaven chearful, pleas'd survay'd;
Cloud-marks discharg'd, bright, azure Face display'd,
Dropt pearly Dews; then free from Congelation;
The World restor'd since former Youth's privation.

No sooner had the Lady Morn in state,
Usher'd by Star, walk'd forth her Eastern gate;
From glorious Couch Rose-spread to take the air,
That still might seem with blushing Cheeks more fair;
Scatt'ring her Dew like Crystal Pendents round,
As Favours to adorn the fruitful Ground:
But straight beheld on large Ortesian Plain
(Prime Rendevouz) great store o'th Pastor-train,
Choicest Arcadian youth, most active Men,
Each walking from their Country-grange as then.
Young Females (last) conjoyn'd, that gaudy Day
Quick, early Risers too, but mirthful Play
Was their chief end, supreme; and more to grace
PAN'S Festival, stil'd God of Sheep, that Place,
Each  Shepherdess shew'd trim'd and beautifi'd
With handsom Garb; careless, neglected Pride;
Nice, formal freaks of Art could shun, forbear,
Tho flaunting too:  good skins and Features there:
As Nature thought to th' World it should be known,
She was not ti'd to gorgeous Courts alone.

Let it suffice, some had the name of Fair,
Might Princes please:  Young Pastors too did share
For manlike Form, ingenuous Parts combin'd:
Tho Shepherds call'd not prov'd of servile kind
(Since kept their Own or Fathers Flocks) but there,
Like Graziers now, gentiler Stamp did bear. . . .
