Wit long opprest, and fill'd at last with rage,
Thus in a sullen mood rebukes the Age.
What loads of Fame do modern Hero's bear,
For an inglorious, long, and lazy War?
Who for some Skirmish or a safe Retreat,
(Not to be dragg'd to Battle) are call'd Great.
But oh, what do ambitious States-men gain!
Who into private Chests whole Nations drain?
What sums of Gold they hoard is dayly known,
To all mens cost, and sometimes to their own.
Your Lawyer too, that like an O Yes bawls,
That drowns the Market-Higler in the Stalls,
That seems begot, conceiv'd, and born in brawls;
Yet thrives:  He and his crowd get what thy please,
Swarming all Term-time thro' the Strand like Bees,
They buz at Westminster, and lye for Fees.
The godly too their ways of getting have;
But none so much as your Phanatick Knave:
Wisely the wealthiest Livings they refuse,
Who by the fattest Bishopricks wou'd loose;
Who with short hair, large Ears, and small blue Band,
True Rogues, their own, not Gods Elect, command.
Let Pigs then be prophane; but Broths allow'd,
Possets and Christian Caudles may be good,
Meet helps to reinforce a Brother's blood;
Therefore each Female Saint he does advise,
With groans, and hums, and ha's, and gogling eyes,
To rub him down, and make the Spirit rise.
While with his zeal transported, from the ground
He mounts, and sanctifies the Sisters round.
On Poets onely no kind Star e're smill'd;
Curst Fate has damn'd 'em every Mothers Child:
Therefore he warns his Brothers of the Stage
To write no more to an ingrateful age.
Think what penurious Masters you have serv'd;
Tasso ran mad, and noble Spencer starv'd.
Turn then, who e're thou art that canst write well,
Thy Ink to Gaul, and in Lampoons excell.
Forswear all honesty, traduce the Great,
Grow impudent, and rail against the State;
Bursting with spleen, abroad thy Pasquils send,
And chuse some Libel-spreader for thy Friend:
The Wit and Want of Timon point thy mind,
And for thy Satyr-subject chuse Mankind.
