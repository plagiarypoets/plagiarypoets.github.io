Ye lovely orbs, that in your courses roll,
Spangling the firmament with living light,
In countless millions spread from pole to pole,
And streaming through the shadows of the night,&mdash;
How can my ravish'd soul, in love and wonder lost,
Enough adore the hand that form'd your glitt'ring host!

Oft, through the silence of the starlight hour,
When other eyes are clos'd in gentle sleep,
When I, a stranger to her healing power,
O'er the dim lamp my midnight vigils keep;
Sick of the gloomy scene, and pale quivering light,
That saddens all my soul, and tires my aching sight.

Softly I steal me to the open air,
To breathe awhile the balmy breath of heav'n,
Look round that world, supported by his care,
And all the various blessings widely given.
Rapt with the glorious view, my soul essays
Hosannas to his name, his mighty name to raise!
