Whenas I view'd with ravish'd wonderment,
Earth's every beauty and each landskip gay;
To heav'n my adoration I up-sent,
And deem'd nought here cou'd beauteous be as they:
But when my eyes up to the heav'ns did stray,
And view'd all glorious walking thro' the sky
The gorgeous sun, my wonder flew that way,
Compar'd with that great sight all glories die:
For what (methought) with it cou'd dare to vie?
Ah me, I had not then, fair maid, beheld
Thy blooming cheeks and either sparkling eye,
Those worthier wonder than earth's gayest field:
Those lovelier than each light that rolls on high,
Who views new lives, and yet who view must die.
