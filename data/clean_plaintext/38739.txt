Genius of SETTLE, animate the Lay
Which tells in Numbers near as bad as thine,
When LONDON'S Senate drives its Care away,
Intent alone to drink, and dance, and dine.

Now every Hall with solid Dainties groans,
And pours its Fur-gown'd Gluttons to the Street;
While as in Dirt they drag along the Stones,
Each Paunch exults in what it has to eat!

Now to their Stands, in clumsy Crouds they pour,
With Wine and Pipes their famish'd Guts to cheer;
Lamenting that 'tis almost Half an Hour,
Since last they gorg'd on solid Beef and Beer!

Now from Guildhall the gorgeous State drags on,
And many a Coach, with many a Statesman cramm'd,
Each Carriage groaning under Half a Ton,
While slip shod Gapers find that they are bamm'd.

Wet to the Skin, and draggled to the Rump,
They seek the Gin-shop, to the Purl-house run;
And with 'em home, five Miles from Aldgate Pump,
Ere they had come to see such dirty Fun.

Now to the Barges, now the Streamers fly!
Against the Tide to RUFUS HALL we work:
&mdash;But Peace to Grumbling &mdash; solid Comfort's nigh,
In Cakes, and Tongues, and rich Westphalian Pork.

The Duties of the Morning we discharge:
&mdash;Back in the Gloom, while Rain incessant pours;
Again, with Weight unweildy, load the Barge;
&mdash;With Pop-gun Gratulations from the Shores.

Now, safe as Sailors, every Danger past!
Full well we know our Knives and Forks to play:
&mdash;But highest Pleasures must the shortest last!
"We eat, in Dreams, the Custard of the Day."
