Then Love, sweet sighing, sat with bending Eyes,
Her Swain's lov'd Picture on her Bosom bound!
She look'd like some soft Angel of the Skies,
While all the Guests, entranc'd!  flock'd around,
Fear, for her sake, snatch'd up the rusty Steel,
And Anger drop'd the uplifted sword,
Revenge and Malice lost their maddening zeal,
And Envy now for once ador'd!
Courteous she curtsied as she pass'd along,
And seem'd to breathe Arabian Air!
A sky blue zone around her waist was hung,
A Robe of white adorn'd the Fair!&mdash;
But sweeter still, if Sweeter can be found,
Celestial Pity, with a Dove like Eye,
Cast a soul-melting Look around,
While from her Bosom, heav'd a trembling Sigh!
When her full Memory, from historic Page,
Recorded Tales of agonizing woe,
She felt the Patriot's Flame, the Prisoner's Cage,
The Curse of treacherous Friend and furious Foe.
So strongly on her Brain impress'd,
The various Maladies of Man,
That Distant Ills disturb'd her fainting Breast,
As if before her Face they all began.
