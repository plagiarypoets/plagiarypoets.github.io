Once more, my Hawkins, I attempt to raise
My feeble voice to urge the tuneful song
Of that sweet Muse, which to her Country's wrong
Or sleeps, or only wakes to Latian lays.
Great is the merit, well-deserv'd the praise
Of that last Work, where Reasoning just and strong
In charming verse thy name shall bear along
To learned foreiners, and future days:
Yet do not thou thy native language scorn,
In which great Shakspear, Spenser, Milton sang
Such strains as may with Greek, or Roman vie:
This cultivate, raise, polish, and adorn;
So each fair Maid shall on thy numbers hang,
And every Briton bless thy melody.
