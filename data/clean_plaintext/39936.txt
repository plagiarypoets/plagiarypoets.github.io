Look on the sky!  look while its glories last!
See the Sun's harbingers!  Those purple hues&mdash;
Those roseate tints &mdash; that golden girdle vast,
That fades into the blue, and strives to lose
The splendid in the delicate!  Who that views
These varied wonders, does not grieve, to know
That they must vanish with these twinkling dews,
Soon as the Sun his dazzling orb shall shew,
He whom they herald forth &mdash; He by whose light they glow?

Look on the silent lake it pictures forth,
Chastened, the brightness of the morning sky.
From polished South far up to utmost North
The mingled colors of the rainbow lie,
Seen through the early mist that lightly by
Floats on the breeze.  The coming Sun will cast
A brightness on it that will blast the eye,
And these bright splendors will no longer last
Than their bright types in heaven.  The Sun approaches fast.

Now fade these gentler beauties &mdash; every tint
Lost in a blaze of undistinguished light,
And he who did these pictures fair imprint
Upon the sullen sable of the night,
Now dashes all into confusion bright.
But who will grieve, when to our eyes is given
All nature in a moonlike splendor dight&mdash;
A lake from which each shadowy mist is driven
A glory-shedding Sun, for a soft-painted Heaven!

Life dawns in beauty on the gloomy past,
Such joys as this world gives are strewed around
In fair profusion; promising to last
Till the dread trump its warning note shall sound.
But life's delights are still a weakness found,
As rainbows glow not in the clear blue sky,
And he to paltry things is meanly bound
Who joys not that the "perfect day" is nigh,
When all delights are merged in simple bliss on high.
