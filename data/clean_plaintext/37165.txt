Within that deep embowering wood was seen
A nymph of fairest, comliest deport
Grave, yet her smile was Heaven's light I ween,
The twilight hour she ever lov'd to court!&mdash;
And when the moon-beams on the rill disport,
Or through the branches chequer the green sward,
Would walk alone, and often stop full short,
Her bright blue eyes upraising heavenward,
And breathe forth accents soft, like sweetest music heard.

These sacred haunts, the sages, as was meet,
Sought; and this maid yclept Solitude.
There Folly ne'er was seen; but, with staid feet,
Shunning the world's turmoil, came oft the good,
The sweets to taste of intellectual food.
Yet, ever and anon, the nymph was seen
To fondle a fair boy, an urchin rude,
And kiss his rosy lips, and sparkling een,
And press him to her breast, right lovingly I ween.

And when, with sport o'ercome, beneath the shade
Asleep she found him, gently would essay
Upon her snowy breast to place his head,
And with his auburn ringlets fondly play;
Then her sweet lips to his would softly lay,
And balmy kisses rapturously steal;
Till, fearful that they would betray
Her wantonness, and ardent love reveal,
Quick she would fly away, her blushes to conceal.

He was a sportive and most trickish wight:
And to reform him was her choicest pride;
Yet, while her speech was meet with wisdom dight,
He, laughing, glanc'd his roguish eye aside,
And all her gravest lessons would deride.
Often she strove to gain his venom'd darts,
Which he with wily skill did ever hide;
And when she list not, made her bosom smart,
And laugh'd to hear her sigh, and gloried in his art.
