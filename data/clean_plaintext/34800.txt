On many a wind upborn the Theban swan,
Safe in his strength of wing, the Heav'n explores.
Aloft on curling clouds he scorns the plain,
And through the trackless void securely soars:
Whilst like the toiling Bee my humble sight
Still loves the ground, nor tempts the dangerous height.

With ceaseless wing, from flow'r to flow'r I rove,
Whatever sweets the freshen'd meadows yield;
The thymy copse I wing, the blooming grove;
From all with pain my little stores are fill'd.
Haply from these, as some propitious time,
The Muse collects her song and no ungrateful rhime.

Not such the song, but nobler far attends
Caesar triumphant up the sacred hill,
When in slow Majesty his Car ascends,
And drags the chain'd Sycambrian at his wheel,
These Themes, my friend, thy bolder notes demand,
The lyre of Julius and a master hand.

The muse of Antony shall best display
Our various joy, when Rome receives her Lord,
The pompous Sacrifice, the Festal day,
The Votive Games, for Caesar safe restor'd;
He comes &mdash; at once contentious discords cease,
Hush'd is the Forum, and the Bar at peace.

Now the big Pomp, slow moving, floats along;
The sons of Rome, unnumber'd, pour behind;
Loud shouts of joy resound from every tongue,
And Long Triumphal Ios load the wind.
On to the Temples press the grateful train,
An hundred altars blaze, and Hecatombs are slain.

That day, tho' all too weak, my voice will I,
Exulting, strive to reach the victor's ear,
For who can then restrain the swelling joy,
Or the tumultuous shout in silence hear,
Io auspicious hour!  Hail welcome morn!
Hail to the Sun's and Caesar's wish'd return.
