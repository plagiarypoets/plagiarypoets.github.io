But where shall now the daring Muse
That rich exhaustless treasure find,
Of lively, warm, and brilliant hues,
Where strength with beauty dwells combin'd,
To paint those glorious visions of delight,
Which met within the walls my ravish'd sight?

Could I that pencil's force command,
Which once pourtray'd ALCINA'S land;
Or his, who taught the song to rove
Through fair ARMIDA'S magic grove;
Or his, who paints ACRASIA'S wanton bow'r,
And decks the charming spot with ev'ry fairy flow'r.

Had I that bold seraphic tongue,
Which youthful EDEN'S glories sung;
Or his, whose heroes rest from toil
In CYTHEREA'S verdant isle,
Who wanders wild thro' Pleasure's flow'ry plain,
And bathes in passion deep the rich voluptuous strain:

Then might I hope, with happier hand, to draw
Some faint resemblance of the scenes I saw;
Tho' still the picture would be far behind
The bright conception of the painter's mind,
Which these artificers of tuneful speech,
With all their varied skill, would fail to reach.
At first the glare of bliss was too intense
For mortal strength, and each bewilder'd sense
Sunk lifeless down before the plastic pow'rs
That reign'd eternal in those fairy bow'rs,
Whose magic there on ev'ry object threw
The dazzling light of Beauty's brilliant hue;
And fill'd the wanton airy that danc'd around,
With charming odour and delightful sound.
But who can tell the pride of fragrant bow'rs,
The rich profusion of immortal flow'rs;
The crystal streams that sweetly flow'd along,
And o'er their pebbles made melodious song;
The painted tribes that, perch'd on ev'ry spray,
Attun'd their notes to love's harmonious lay?
There still did smiling Summer's golden eye
Look down propitious from a cloudless sky;
There to the charm of Spring's ambrosial pow'r
Was join'd the boast of Autumn's wealthy dow'r,
Who there, for ever ripe, yet ever young,
On each fair tree in purple triumph hung;
There still with dewy step the gentle dawn
Mov'd o'er the verdure of the glossy lawn;
And there, with influence meek, and sober grace,
Still bath'd in coolness Nature's smiling face;
Nor e'er allow'd the splendid orb of day
To lift above the hills his glaring ray,
And drive, with flaming torch, the peaceful morn away.

Now had mine eyes these charms at leisure view'd,
And thus the gracious Pow'r his speech renew'd:&mdash;

"What here, my son, thy wonder sees around,
Makes but one province of my fairy ground;
But one of five, which form a finish'd whole,
And yet with diff'rent beauties charm the soul.
Full in the midst of this extensive plain,
Where Fate's command has fixt my splendid reign.
Appears that MOUNTAIN of immortal fame,
Which bears SUBLIMITY'S exalted name;
From which enchanting PITY'S VALE descends,
And to the South its shadowy length extends;
While to the North, when round the mount you roam,
You meet with RIDICULE'S capricious DOME:
But in the sea which bathes its western side
Lies FANCY'S ISLE, in wild romantic pride;
And here, where now you breathe ambrosial air,
East of the Mount, is BEAUTY'S GARDEN rare.
In all these scenes are diff'rent seats assign'd
For diff'rent orders of the tuneful mind,
Who, while their hours in endless rapture flow,
Forget the hardships they endur'd below.
These fair abodes, at leisure now to view,
Let us, with heedful steps, our course pursue;
Nor will my vocal aid be needful here
To point them out, as they by turns appear;
Since well thy curious eye has known so long
The various features of the sons of song,
That one slight glance will bring to Mem'ry's view
Their name, their genius, and the scenes they drew."&mdash;

He spoke, and mov'd &mdash; nor did my eager mind,
By sloth or fear discourag'd, lag behind.&mdash;
And now, what first of all our notice drew,
And with its gentle beauty cheer'd the view,
Was a rich spot of gayest freshness green,
In midst of which a silver fount was seen,
The floating surface of whose mirror bright
Reflected back the images of sight,
And show'd each pebble small in clear display,
Whose sparkling smoothness at the bottom lay;
Its velvet bank no foot could e'er forsake,
Until his lips had touch'd the limpid lake,
So sweet the murmur of its tinkling sound,
And such the coolness which it breath'd around.
There sate the slave, whose pow'rs from AFRIC'S shore
To ROME'S proud walls her better Genius bore,
And taught him there, with Freedom's flowing vein,
To pour translucent forth his comic strain.
And there, in negligent but neat array,
The gay FONTAINE in opposition lay:
Unrivall'd Bard, whose fame o'er all prevails
For simple apologues and comic tales;
Around their Poet still, without dismay,
Frisk'd all the brutal tribes in wanton play,
And at his feet his darling Reynard lay.
There both enjoy'd that richest bliss refin'd,
Which feeling souls an earth so rarely find,
When mind congenial meets congenial mind.
Oft bending down, with amiable grace,
Each view'd with pleasure his reflected face;
And oft the GALLIC Bard, in sportive mood,
Made playful eddies in the circling flood,
But went at times too far, and dim'd its waves with mud.

From thence not far a charming bank was seen,
Cloth'd in the brightness of eternal green,
O'er which the beech its rustic umbrage hung,
And flow'rs from which in wild profusion sprung;
Not those, whose gaudy pomp the wearied gaze
With more of wonder than delight surveys;
But those whose simple and unmingled hues
Each eye with calm and constant pleasure views;
The golden crocus and the violet pale,
The sweet narcissus that embalms the gale,
And gentle primrose buds, the pride of ev'ry vale.
There wanton kids skipp'd o'er the glossy ground,
And lambs in frolic measures danc'd around;
And there, on Nature's couch extended, lay
The two great Masters of the rural lay;
That ancient Bard, who, made SICILIA'S plains
Resound the sweetness of his DORIC strains;
And he who fill'd the groves, erewhile so mute,
With the sweet echoes of his SAXON flute;
Who to the verse in measur'd pomp that flows,
Preferr'd the humbler garb of graceful prose:
And yet the GREEK foregoes his tuneful claim,
And yields HELVETIA'S Son the palm of fame;
Gladly he bows to that superior mind,
Whose matchless art his darling Muse refin'd;
Who bade her move with more majeftic pace,
With more bewitching softness fill'd her face,
And deck'd her simple form with more attractive grace.

Still onward led by Taste's indulgent pow'r,
I next beheld a gay delightful bow'r,
O'er which with lavish pomp the mantling vine
Spread the rich umbrage of its fruit divine;
And where around, each purple swarm between,
The fragrant myrtle wreath'd its brilliant green;
There, gaily perch'd the rustic arch above,
Sate the two birds of frolic and of love,
The wanton sparrow here, and there the gentle dove.
Within the bow'r, by equal taste conjoin'd,
Two jocund minstrels lay, at ease reclin'd;
The sprightly Sage from TEOS' winding shore,
And LESBIA'S Bard, whom proud VERONA bore;
The tuneful teachers both of soft desire,
And matchless masters of the sportive lyre:
The GREEK rehears'd, in many a liquid line,
The charms of beauty, and the joys of wine;
While the sweet ROMAN'S more voluptuous tongue,
Of countless stars, and countless kisses sung:
Soft were the notes, to youthful Fancy dear,
And tho' condemn'd by Reason's voice severe,
They charm'd the feeling heart, and sooth'd the tuneful ear.

The bow'r was left; and o'er a wide expanse,
In liveliest verdure drest, we next advance;
Its length delightful reach'd a river's side,
Whose distant waves in silence seem'd to glide;
As velvet smooth appear'd the level green,
In which no rough rebellious tuft was seen,
So quick the scythe each rising growth destroy'd,
And the round roller was so much employ'd.
While this refreshing scene engag'd mine eye,
Four gentle knights came softly riding by,
Each mounted on a well-proportion'd steed,
Of those ARABIA'S fertile pastures breed:
Adown their sides no tinsel trappings hung,
Nor cloth of gold a gaudy lustre flung;
Their pride was steel alone, whose polish'd hue
Around their steps a sober glory threw;
His courser each with graceful ease bestrode,
And o'er the plain in gentlest measure rode.
The first was he, whose comprehensive mind
At once the warrior and the sage combin'd;
Whose sweet  but simple page records so well
The luckless field where youthful CYRUS fell,
And all those toils the brave Ten Thousand bore,
Before they reach'd again their native shore.
Next was the man on whose mellifluous tongue
Assembled ROME so oft with rapture hung,
And who conjoin'd with sweet Persuasion's pow'r
The boast of Wisdom's philosophic dow'r.
The third, in rank of time, was BRITAIN'S Sage.
Who fill'd with purest truth his moral page,
And brought, in Diction's loveliest robe array'd,
His charming CLIO forth to Virtue's aid.
And last appear'd the Prince of GALLIC prose,
Who shun'd in FERNEY'S shades his bigot foes;
Whose daring head with ev'ry wreath was crown'd,
But most triumphant on historic ground.

But now the glorious cavalcade was past,
And we the distant river gain'd at last,
To which no torrent gave unwonted force,
Nor rugged rock detain'd its gentle course,
But smooth as glass the peaceful waves appear,
For ever silent, and for ever clear.
Across the stream one simple arch was flung,
And o'er the flood in slender beauty hung,
Full in the midst of which we paus'd awhile,
And turning to the left beheld an isle&mdash;
A charming isle &mdash; which, tho' of smallest size,
Yet fix'd, and long detain'd our wond'ring eyes:
For lavish Nature had assembled there
Whate'er was costly, brilliant, rich, and rare;
With sweet reluctance there the bashful rose
Appear'd her virgin beauties to disclose,
While the bold tulip, flaunting by her side,
Display'd, unask'd, her many-colour'd pride;
There too the orange spread its golden bloom,
And fill'd the circling air with rich perfume;
And there the gorgeous peacock, proud and vain,
Show'd the broad splendor of his starry train:
Two graceful swans, in purest white array'd,
Around the isle their silver circuit made,
And IRIS over all, for ever young,
Her bright unfading arch of glory flung.
In this delicious spot, by Fate confin'd,
Past their sweet hours two TUSCAN Bards refin'd:
The man who first array'd in tragic hues.
The simple features of the Past'ral Muse,
And raising next his voice to wars alarms,
Sung the success of GODFREY'S pious arms,
And TANCRED'S luckless love, and fair ARMIDA'S charms.
He too was there, who taught his FAITHFUL SWAIN
A language foreign to the rural plain;
And whose refinement deck'd each brilliant part
With much of nature, but with more of art,
Which always charm'd the ear, and sometimes reach'd the heart.

Now from the isle our wearied eyes withdrew,
And up the river bent their alter'd view;
Where a rich barge came slowly down the stream,
And ting'd the water with a golden gleam;
A barge in Art's most elegant array,
With burnish'd Prow, and purple streamers gay,
All but the topmost flag, whose sable hues
Confest the liv'ry of the Tragic Muse.  
The painted oars two tender Poets plied,
And cut with graceful ease, the silver tide;
The GALLIC stage's boast, whose classic mind
To purest chastity his verse refin'd;
Who wretched PHEDRA'S guilty flame pourtray'd,
And DIAN'S victim sung, the hapless maid
By her reluctant fire's ambitious pride betray'd:
And he whose magic brought, in strains divine,
Where harmony attunes each golden line,
The fate of SHORE'S unhappy wife to view,
And fair CALISTA'S vain repentance drew.

Thus long reposing on the bridge we stood,
Which now we past, and reach'd a pleasant wood,
Compos'd of ev'ry various race of trees,
Whose size or shape the judging eye could please;
But chief the graceful larch and poplar tall
Profusely rose, and overtopt them all.
Shrubs too were there, of ev'ry leaf and bloom,
Whose tints were beauty, or whose breaths perfume.
Each feather'd warbler's song we there could hear,
Whose voice had pow'r to charm the tuneful ear;
But chief in number, from their little throats
The thrush and linnet pour'd melodious notes.
Nor had we travers'd long this ample shade,
Until we lighted on a secret glade,
Where, screen'd from vulgar eyes, a groupe was seen
In fourfold dance upon the flow'ry green.
There was the ROMAN Bard, whose lyric tongue
With frequent praise his clear MAECENAS sung;
Who, dazzled oft by Favour's brilliant ray,
To base OCTAVIUS rais'd the partial lay,
And cast on Flatt'ry's hues his matchless art away.
There too was he that charm'd this latter age,
The grace and glory of the TUSCAN stage,
Whose tender hand the cruel conflict penn'd
Of clement TITUS and his guilty friend,
And mix'd with tragic colours, dark and strong,
The softer, livelier tints of lyric song.
Two sister Graces, with their zones unbound,
Beat, with this favour'd pair, the verdant ground;
The third, a pleas'd spectator, stood beside,
With music's pow'r their hounding steps to guide,
And make the sportive maze in juster measures glide.

But when we left this forest of delight,
A fair pavilion rose before our sight,
On pillars rear'd of PARIAN marble pure,
Whose strength and grace thro' ev'ry age endure
There with IONIA'S order, rich and gay,
Did that of CORINTH hold divided sway;
And there was Triumph's tree, the laurel, seen
Around each shaft to wreathe its deathless green;
While Night's melodious bird, the leaves among,
Pour'd the sweet cadence of her matchless song,
To whose congenial notes two Poets here,
Together seated, lent a raptur'd ear.
The MANTUAN Bard, whose pure and perfect lays
The voice of ev'ry age has join'd to praise;
Whose wond'rous art describ'd, in polish'd strain,
The sports and labours of the rural train;
And changing themes, from PHRYGIA'S flaming shore
LATIUM'S plains the pious exile bore:&mdash;
The BRITON too, on whose enchanting tongue
The whole exhaustless pow'rs of music hung;
Who deck'd in ev'ry colour rich and rare
The violation of BELINDA'S hair;
Whose splendid course with WINDSOR'S praise began,
Who thro' the mighty maze of manners ran,
And led his ethic Muse o'er all the field of man.
On chairs of gold, enthron'd in equal state,
Of Beauty's realm these matchless Monarchs sate,
Supreme of all that boast her lovely dow'r,
Those sweet companions of the leisure hour;
With whom in careless mood we oft retire
From the proud masters of the lofty lyre;
From those who shake the nerves with comic art,
Or with tumultuous passions tear the heart:
These are the darling Bards, whose gentle sway
The mind without fatigue can still obey;
Who soothe th' enchanted ear, and steal the heart away.
