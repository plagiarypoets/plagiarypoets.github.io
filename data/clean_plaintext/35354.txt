But now 'tis time to end this doleful ditty,
And leave at once the dismal Vale of Pity;
'Tis time, high time, to change this woeful measure,
And treat my guests with brisker notes of pleasure.

Come then, thou jolly jocund Pow'r,
Gay Lord of Laughter's loosen'd hour,
Who gav'st me late to lead along,
In praise of Whist, the sprightly song,
And taught, in Satire's sparkling stream,
To soak the dry and sober theme;
Once more let thy propitious smiles
Inspire my last of comic toils;
Once more renew his sportive vein,
Who ne'er will trouble thee again.

The largest lobster ever got
Was yet unboil'd in Change's pot;
"Id est," a suit of raven black
Was hanging still on Midnight's back;
O'er which, without the least remorse,
My Friend and I pursued our course;
That Friend, who from the upper story
Came down to show me scenes of glory,
With scenes of dreary dismal hue,
And scenes of fun and frolic too.

But now a dim and distant ray
Began to melt the dark away;
No light that grew on Nature's soil,
But child of tallow and of oil;
By which we soon conclusion drew
We enter'd had an avenue,
If avenue it might be reckon'd,
Whose part the first had ne'er a second;&mdash;
For while the left was planted all
With wond'rous stately trees, and tall,
Upon the right was nothing set else,
But burs and kecksies, docks and nettles,
And all that vile and useless tribe
Which none but Botanists describe,
Those formal souls, who, think, like asses,
That Nature rang'd her works in classes,
And that philosophic precision
Consists entirely in division;&mdash;
Nor could I here a wish avoid,
That he who deck'd this dexter side
Had not much rather left it bare,
Than fill'd it with such worthless ware:
Like those who late, in SCOTIA'S land,
EDINA'S modern City plann'd,
And when among their streets they came
To that which bears the PRINCE'S name,
With houses fill'd the northern side,
But left the other blank and void,
Producing thus the finest row,
That EUROPE or the World can show;
But for a street &mdash; Oh Lord, Sir, no.

But to return from this digression,
Deriv'd from ocular impression:
This avenue, thus oddly dighted,
Was likewise very strangely lighted;
For on the right a brilliant border
Of lamps appear'd, arrang'd in order,
While on the left did nothing stand else,
But one poor row of farthing candles.
On then we past, and many a queer
Discordant sound assail'd our ear:
The Lion rais'd, from time to time,
His voice terrific and sublime,
Which soon, from t' other side the way,
Was answer'd by the Ass's bray;
The horned Owl, of solemn note,
Sweet ATTIC warbler, pour'd her throat,
To which there instantly  came back
The Duck's response, of, Quack, quack, quack;
There too the Peacock's horrid squall,
Follow'd the Blackbird's madrigal;
And there the Linnet's lays divine 
Were answer'd by the grunting Swine.
That I should ask what such a scene
Of motley sounds and sights could mean
Will by my Reader scarce be doubted;
But ere I got my lips about it,
My noble second-sighted Guide,
To what I had not ask'd, replied.

You need not thus, my boy, be staring,
Like some stuck pig, or some dead herring,
For that whereof you critic would be
Is all but right, and as it should be.
A strange capricious gentleman
Form'd of this avenue the plan,
Who here has always rul'd the roast,
And almost evry pow'r engrost;
Of all our schemes the great deviser,
And of this realm, in short, Grand Visier:
His name (I see you burn to get it)
Squire CONTRAST is &mdash; now don't forget it.
By his direction and his rule
Was built the HOUSE of RIDICULE;
Yon edifice, that stands before ye,
In all its odd fantastic glory.
You see how gay the southern side
Appears, in marble's richest pride,
And how its walls and windows deck'd are
With all the pomp of Architecture;
While on the north was never seen
A pile so paltry and so mean;
So poor and vile a work of patch,
With walls of brick, and roof of thatch:
The gate itself, you may behold,
Is one half cedar, fring'd with gold;
While t' other half, not quite so good,
Is all of rotten worthless wood.&mdash;
But now let's in &mdash; come, follow me&mdash;
And you shall see &mdash; what you shall see.

I did not disobey command,
And turning to the better hand,
Ourselves within a place we found
With tools of Cookery hung round,
And call'd (as Taste bewhisper'd me)
The kitchen of Buffonery:
There, by the dim uncertain flame
Which from a fire of cinders came,
We saw three seated round a table,
Which, tho' but coarse, was comfortable&mdash;
Three lovers of the laughing mood&mdash;
And smoking hot before them stood
As large and thick a mess of porridge
As ever warm'd a ploughman's courage,
To which (if I the fact may mention)
They seem'd to pay no slight attention;
For which one skill'd in Nature's laws
Might have, perhaps, assign'd a cause,
And said (and probably said right)
That they had all an appetite.
Two were in ancient garb array'd,
And had pursued the comic trade;
The one was that satiric Sage,
Who charm'd so long th' ATHENIAN Stage.
And there, to please the vulgar eye,
Made wasps to buzz, and birds to fly;
Who taught a tuneful band of frogs
To croak among the STYGIAN bogs,
And to his theatre drew crowds
To hear the language of the CLOUDS.
The other Bard was he who drew
The strange discordant interview
AMPHYTRION'S wilder'd slave between
And the arch-thief that filch'd his mien;
Who tun'd, when Comedy was young,
To LATIAN sounds her infant tongue,
And treated ROME with many a feast
Of coarse conceit and vulgar jest.
The third, who only dealt in prose,
Appear'd a FRENCHMAN by his cloaths;
The same whose fancy brought to view all
The noble deeds of PANT AGRUEL;
O'er Satire's field who wander'd wide,
With nought but Caprice for his guide,
And for one flow'r in Humour's meads
Pick'd up a thousand worthless weeds.
While we this trio view'd, old ARI-
STOPHANES began to carry
A hearty spoonful to his throat
Of hasty-pudding, piping hot;
But feigning that he had forgot
To his own chops the nearest way,
Lodg'd it in those of RABELAIS;
Who, to revenge the dire disgrace,
Threw some into the GRECIAN'S face;
And he, who now with fury burn'd,
The ardent compliment return'd.
Nor yet would PLAUTUS idle stand,
But lent them both a helping hand;
And thus what first was nothing at all
Was now become a gen'ral battle,
Where lumps of pudding flew around,
Inflicting many a scorching wound;
Nor did we think it safe to stay
To see the issue of the fray,
But took FRENCH leaves, and came away.

The place which next we went to see
Was call'd the Room of Repartee;
Still on the floor that touch'd the ground,
And there two gentlemen we found;
With watchful eye they seem'd to stand,
And each a battledore in hand,
With which the cork with feathers crown'd
They made from each to each rebound
The one his stroke at times who mist
Was ROME'S great Epigrammatist,
The smart facetious poet MARTIAL,
To whom DOMITIAN was so partial,
That he his dwarfish slight essays
Preferr'd to VIRGIL'S lofty lays;
The other, he whose witty rage
Corrupted once the BRITISH stage,
And stead of Humour's genuine feasts
Gave nought but strings of brilliant jests:
His sprightly hand the courtship drew
Of Mr. TATTLE and Miss PRUE:
SCANDAL was his, the constant railer,
With FONDLEWIFE, and BEN the Sailor,
And BLUFF, the man of wordy valour.

But new this room's survey was ended,
And thence up stairs we next ascended;
Lightly we tript, and landed soon
In Satire's large and long saloon:
Where at each end a table stood,
For science one, and one for food.
The former drew our first regards,
At which were placed two bitter Bards,
Renown'd on earth for Satirists,
Tho' here they play'd Anatomists.
The one, was he who dar'd assume
The Censorship of guilty ROME,
And for the bold indignant rage,
With which he lash'd a shameless age,
Was doom'd to linger in exile
Upon the brutal banks of NILE.
The other Bard was better bred,
And better knew the Courtier's trade:
Content with safe and vulgar game,
At titled Vice he ne'er took aim,
But chief his bitterness confin'd
To caitiffs of the tuneful kind,
And mix'd his keen satiric lays
With fulsome notes in BOURBON'S praise.
The ROMAN, who display'd his art
In carving of a female heart,
Each latent spot and secret flaw
With vile malicious pleasure saw;
And ev'ry speck of sable hue
With cruel scorn held up to view.
The FRENCHMAN, with as much severity,
And still with rather more dexterity,
Was lab'ring to dissect a dull
Malignant Poet's hard-grain'd scull,
Of vanity and envy full,
Whose worthless cavity contains
Enough of wind, but little brains.

Now turning to the other table,
Which rather look'd more comfortable,
Thereon two covers we survey'd,
And things in rank for supper laid,
While warm and snug, another pair
Of Satirists were seated there&mdash;
The GREEK, whose lively fancy drew
So many a pleasing interview;
Who heroes old so well could show
Conversing in the shades below,
And whose celestial dialogues
Made all OLYMPUS whores and rogues
His messmate was HIBERNIA'S boast,
In caustic wit himself a host;
Expose to view who durst presume
The secrets of the dressing-room;
Who ev'n reveal'd to vulgar sight
The raptures of the bridal night,
And trembling STREPHON'S eager joy
To find a woman in his CHLOE;
But worst of all, whose faithless hand,
At slighted Rancour's dire command,
The vile disgustful picture drew
Of that inhuman brute YAHOO.
Before them, hunger's best relief,
An ample dish of steaks of beef,
Stood smoking, juicy fat, and nice, 
Of which they each secur'd a slice,
And season'd it, without dispute,
As best it might his palate suit.
The GREEK was mighty well content
With pickles from JAMAICA sent,
And pepper brought from SURINAM,
More hot and fiery than a dram.
Not so ST. PATRICK'S dirty Dean,
Who rubb'd along his platter clean
Of assafoetida a pound,
Which threw a dismal stench around,
And then he gobbled up in haste
His odoriferous repast;
Which done, no longer would he stay,
But instant rose, and ran away.
Then to my keen inquiring eye
My gracious Guide made this reply:&mdash;
"I cannot bring my tuneful tongue,
To sounds of other order strung,
To tell you now the shameful place
Where this strange wretch has hid his face,
Who views those sights with pleasure's smiles,
From which each other eye recoils;
To whom those sounds alone are dear,
That strike with pain each other ear:
If curiosity be strong,
Much better go with him along,
And see him there, in all his glory,
Rehearsing of a filthy story;
But me you, must, my child, excuse,
Whose eye such objects never views."
To this what answer I should make,
Long time to think I did not take:
"I feel," says I, "no inclination
For such minute investigation;
And rather ne'er would see his face,
Than follow him to such a place."

At this laconic declaration
My Tutor smil'd with approbation;
And after what I have recounted,
Up stairs a second time we mounted,
And reach'd the third concluding story,
Of all this House the pride and glory,
In which was, Humour's ample hall,
And Wit's gay closet, neat and small;
So small indeed, that it was fit
To hold but one or two.  In it
We saw, reclining at a table,
The matchless Bard, whose comic fable
Of HUDIBRAS would almost force
Smiles from the muscles of a horse;
His pow'rful hand was sketching out
A picture of the rabble rout,
Where many a figure strange he drew,
And many a phiz grotesque and new;
And tho' some features soon decay'd,
The greater part shall never fade.
At this great Master's feet was seen,
Of humble imitative mien,
A pupil Bard, who from his draught
Some strokes to fill his canvass caught;
And tho' his tints were not so strong,
Their strength perhaps might last as long:
'Twas he whose skill, in sportive lays,
His philosophic lore conveys,
And ALMA'S progress, sov'reign dame,
Attends o'er all the human frame;
'Twas he who last presum'd to sing
The virtues rare of CARVEL'S ring;
The ladle, cause of nuptial strife,
And grave PURGANTI'S wanton wife:
On these effusions rests the claim
On which alone he builds his fame;
Whilst all his long and lofty lyrics,
And all his am'rous panegyrics,
Are, in this land, remember'd not,
And even by himself forgot.

But leaving now Wit's closet small,
We enter'd Humour's spacious hall,
In midst of which there stood a board
With bottles well and glasses stor'd,
Where sate three Chiefs, who might to trial
Of comic pow'rs the world defy all.
The first was he who brought to light
The follies of LA MANCHA'S knight,
With all his crazy freaks and fancies,
And all his laughable mischances;
Who of ideas trac'd the train
That rose in SANCHO'S motley brain,
Where ignorance, in rich display,
With Shrewdness held divided sway.
The next, whom FRANCE with justice styles
The greatest cook of comic smiles,
Was he whose courage dragg'd to light
That horrible, but useful sight,
The heart-strings of a hypocrite;
Who AGNES drew, devoid of art,
With HARPAGON'S penurious heart,
And stern ALCEST'S eccentric mind,
The virtuous hater of his kind.
The third (tho' last yet not the least)
Produc'd a glorious ENGLISH feast,
Where ev'ry course of rich and rare
Was usher'd with a bill of fare:
Of all the services was chief
An ample roast of FOUNDLING beef;
There SQUARE appear'd, that strangest fish,
And PARTRIDGE, that delicious dish;
And there as good a WESTERN pudding
As ever plate or trencher stood in.
To this great Lord of high and low
We PARSON ADAMS likewise owe,
And all the tricks the sons of art
Play'd on his honest simple heart.
These matchless three had each a beaker
Before him of his fav'rite liquor;
The BRITON'S plain but rich regale
Was stout balsamic BURTON ale;
The FRENCHMAN, to refresh his brain,
Had got a flask of brisk Champagne;
The SPANIARD'S draught, still more divine,
Was pure and strong MADEIRA wine,
Distill'd, some say, from equal parts
Of female tongues and lions' hearts,
Which he who drinks becomes so clever
That he can talk and fight for ever.
Nor did they keep, with selfish mind,
Their liquors to themselves confin'd;
But still by turns each fill'd his glass,
And made around the bottle pass.

But now our review of this Mansion was ended,
And down stairs again we directly descended.
When my Guide, from some whimsy or sudden suggestion,
Took it into his noddle to ask me this question:
"Since you now, my dear boy, at such leisure have seen
Both the Mansion of Mirth and the Valley of Spleen,
With freedom declare (nor my query think odd)
In which would you like to take up your abode?"
To such catechising I frankly replied,
"Let me visit in both, but in neither reside;
For in my simple notion it would not be clever
For a man to be crying or laughing for ever;
I know that the truly poetical race
(Which, as Vanity whispers, perhaps is my case;
And your notice, good Sir, might indeed make a spirit,
The most bashful and diffident, think he had merit);
I know that these masters of magic divine
To the pensive are chiefly suppos'd to incline;
And yet (tho' but little, perhaps, to my glory)
I must own that I should be prodigiously sorry,
Were I doom'd in Solemnity's shades still to roam,
And never revisit this comical dome,
Whose possessors are sometimes so much to my mind,
And with whom such amusement I frequently find,
That I'm sure there's more virtue in their compositions,
Than in all the prescriptions of all the physicians:
For which of your Doctors could ever discover
So cordial a draught for a chop-fallen lover,
As the potent, delicious, balsamic elixir,
Of which the good Dr. CERVANTES was mixer?
Which with patients agrees of all sexes and ages,
And sorrow and care in an instant assuages;
Which refreshes the heart, and re-comforts the liver,
Which will sparkle, and warm, and enliven for ever."
