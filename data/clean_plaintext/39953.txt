Fair is the freeman's country; fair the land
That once hath felt a tyrant's galling chain,
Yet since, from proudly echoing strand to strand,
Hath sprang to light and liberty again;
Whose navy, once an atom on the main,
Hath spread o'er seas, superior to its foe;
And seizing on the trident, dares to reign
Where late it laid its proud opponent low,
Beneath the power of freedom's swift avenging blow.

Fair are those hills where late in rugged might,
The forest oak was seen to rear its head;
Yet now, across the fancy dazzled sight,
Fair visions flash, as meteors from the dead;
The peaceful dwelling, where the savage tread
Of wolf and panther, lately rous'd the glen,
A populated city in the stead
Of savage tenements, and less than man
Who roam untutored, where, now walks, the denizen.

Yet fairer still is that blest fabric rear'd,
Upon the basis of the enlightened free,
The monument, ten million souls have dared
To build despite, threats of tyranny;
And which, still rises, like the forest tree,
To heights beyond the fond imaginings
Of its best architects; may yet it be
The star, to which, with fast increasing wings
Nations unborn may fly, to seek, what freedom brings.

How beautiful, how bright, its glimmerings shine
Though the dark veil of Superstition's fare,
Like the fair gem, when raised from out the mine,
Diffusing light and radiance once again;&mdash;
It reaches o'er the broad and vasty main
To shed its influence upon other spheres,
And penetrates the mist which long hath lain,
Unknown to birth, amid the darksome years
Of error, and of crime of slavish hopes and fears.

There yet will be an era, when the light
Of liberty, shall shine o'er Europe's land,
And to her sons, reveal the inspiring sight
Of simple Truth, with her unaided wand
Dispersing ignorance, from strand to strand,
And rearing on its soil an edifice
Subservient to no despot's, stern command,
But based on merit, and with only this
To guide its peace, and point its votaries to bliss.

For now, if ever, moves the "march of mind,"
To test with truth the busy scene below,
And little place will error's priesthood find
To graft that fruit, which ne'er can thrive or grow,
Except in souls that have not felt the glow
Of Science's light, diffusing all around
Its brightness, and inspiring man to know
What little knowledge in this state is found,
And rousing all those energies by darkness bound.

For human intellect is like the mine
That lies unseen beneath some citadel,
And till it feel th' exciting torch of pine
Along its train, no talent sound will tell;
But when aroused, no engine will repel
Each barrier to its vent, with greater force,
Nor can strength check the vast and mighty swell
Which curries all in its resistless course.
And leaves but little trace, of its dependant course.

Columbia!  thou hast seen thy brighter day,
The beauteous day of plenty and of peace,
And now emerging from that dreary way,
That leads to slavery, thy perils cease;
Yet, may the genius of thy sons increase
To build fair Science to its topmost height,
And from those bonds, that tie her down, release
The goddess Truth, to shed once more a light
In every freeborn soul, that claims its natal right.

Then, yet more fair will seem thy beauteous soil,
And brighter will thy heroic realms appear;
Then, ever guarded from each tyrant's toil,
Thy glorious country will have nought to fear
From ought of weak, ambitious man's career;
But proudly echoing o'er the vasty sea,
O'er which thy ships will ever dare to steer,
The cry of Liberty, till courts agree,
That heaven hath shed around, its blessings o'er the free.
