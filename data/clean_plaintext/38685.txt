Swells not with indignation ev'ry vein,
When parts and Churchill pour the manly strain?
Affecting Freedom, slave to Faction's band,
He points his bitterest thoughts at her command;
Makes murth'rous lies in proudest numbers shine,
"Whilst Reputation bleeds in ev'ry line."
(O!  dire disgrace to great Apollo's court!)
Shews fire and swords, to please, in wanton sport.
How great a genius is by Faction stain'd!
And like Andromeda to rocks is chain'd!
With pow'rs to tear the wreath from Dryden's brow,
Make Butler laugh, and Pope submissive bow;
Whilst gentle Spencer gently waves his hand,
To point the beauties of the Fairy Land:
Pow'rs that can lead at will th' Aonian throng,
And awe the Earth with majesty of song.
O!  that such pow'rs, as dare the highest height,
Shou'd rake the kennels, and lick Tyburn's feet!
And even there, (so god-like is his skill,)
(For fallen angels are immortal still)
He calls forth flow'rs, as from Arabia's trees,
Makes carrion sweet, and villains gibbets please.
