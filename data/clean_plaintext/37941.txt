By Nature planted &mdash; and by Nature rear'd&mdash;
Uncultur'd emblem of Life's chequer'd gleam&mdash;
Fresh from no dew-drop &mdash; by no sunshine cheer'd,
To animate its fade that fondly seem,
A humble flow'ret woos the summer-beam!
Ye stormy winds, awhile your flight delay,
That frets the current of its rival stream:
Oh, let it bloom its short-liv'd &mdash; languid day&mdash;
Then &mdash; in the lapse of Time &mdash; die silently away!
