Fam'd Erin's harp, too long hast thou been laid,
In songless silence, 'mid ruin'd Tara's walls;
Too long, alas!  have thy witch-notes been staid;
Notes that erst sounded high amid those halls,
Where desolation now, and ruin appals,
And nought reminds us of thy ancient song,
Except when Fancy some chance-cadence calls,
Whilst kindred sympathies the strains prolong,
And paint thee to the ear in numbers smooth and strong!

What, though with feeble powers I thee invoke,
And o'er thy chords a languid finger fling;
What though no poet's fire inspire each stroke,
Nor minstrel rapture brush thee with its wing:
Yet still, once more, I'd gladly hear thee sing
Some wild song of thy ancient minstrelsy,
Once more, with rapture, hear thy peerless string
Proclaim the matchless powers long lost in thee,
And pour in melting strains thy heavenly melody.

Oft, oft hast thou, in numbers wild and bold,
To noble daring roused brave Erin's throng,
And while you fired the young, inspired the old,
Or melted the rapt soul with Pity's song;
Or, 'mid sweet raptures, often didst prolong
The musings of some maid enchain'd in love,
Whose wilder'd fingers stray'd thy chords among,
Which while to fix on thee she vainly strove,
She look'd like one inspir'd with thoughts all fix'd above!

Whilst mouldering damps, for many woeful years,
And rusts corroding round thy chords have clung,
Oft down some aged minstrel's cheek the tears
Have stolen, as of thee he hopeless sung:
His country's sorrows yet, and woes among,
Would fancy paint thee to his soul again,
And on the future, as he musing hung,
Prophetic would describe some future strain,
And swear thy long lost notes had not yet slept in vain!
