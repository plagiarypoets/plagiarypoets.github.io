On each new scene the sons of [   ] vertu
Shall give fresh objects to thy [   ] view,
Bring the graved gem or offer as you pass
The imperial medal and historic brass.
Then o'er its narrow surface may'st thou trace
The genuine spirit of some hero's face;
Or see, minutely touched, the powerful charms
Of some proud fair that set whole realms in arms;
The patriot's story with his look compare
And know the poet by his genial air.

Nor, for they boast no pure Augustan vein,
Reject her poets with a cold disdain.
Oh, think in what sweet lays, how sweetly strong,
Our Fairfax warbles Tasso's forceful song;
How Spenser too, whose lays you oft resume,
Wove their gay [   ] in his fantastic loom;
That Cinthio prompted oft even Shakespeare's flame, 
And Milton valued even Marino's name!
