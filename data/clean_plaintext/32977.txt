When cold starv'n Winter white with Ice and Snow
Declining from our Hemisphere doth goe:
And watrie Planets plunged deepe do yeelde,
Their mantions unto Hyems pleasant childe,
When lucklesse Eccho learnes againe to sing,
The pastorall Songes which Sheapheard neare a Spring;
Or hard beside some murmering Brooke repeat,
Whilst little Lambkins bout the fieldes do bleat.

The amorous God that lovely Tyro knew,
In likenesse of her Husband Enipeu,
Hated by Grecian Nimphes, him whilome loved,
And by the Thuscane, French, and Spanish glouted;
Remembring the rare beautie that was saide
T' adorne faire ISIS face, himselfe araide:
And falling foorth the straights of Gibraltare,
Where by Alcides plast to Coloms are,
His nimble teame of Dolphins he made post,
Along the Spanish and the Gallicke coast:
And when he came where Englands pride doth pay
Her dayly tribute to her Soveraigne Sea,
There he at last unyoakt his wearie teeme,
And went to seeke the faire commended Queene:
Whom by her silver slyding streames he found,
Amid her Maydens on th' enameld ground:
Whose face faire without art, did quickly daze
His eyes, that greedely on it did gaze,
As Phoebus doth our feeble sight,
When we dare looke on his daseling light;

For like the man that unawares doth see
A blasing Comet in the sable skie,
Not having ere before seene such a sight,
Astond, long stares upon the streaming light:
This great God long beheld her beauteous face;
Her beauteous face that Natures workes doth grace,
Till therewith ravisht, he perceivd his hart
Began to faint, and wonted courage part:
And felt each sense enchaunted by her beautie,
Forget his wonted office, and his duetie:
Which wanton Cupid saw as he did lie
Lurking under a sandie banke, to prie
On ISIS beautie, and being v'ery glad,
That then the long desired meane he had
T' avenge him for the envious tale he tolde,
Unto his mother then, when faine he would
Have maried Psiches:  straight he to the hart
Strake ISIS with a leaden headed dart:
Then with an other all of burnisht gold,
He warmd his hart, that had long time been cold;
And made him supplyant, crave remedie
For those hot flames that in his brest gan frie:
But crave in vaine; for when his suite she heard,
At first she waxed pale, being afeard:
But after, like the Rose in month of May,
Coullard with heate of Phoebus goulden ray
For shame her face did seeme, and to him sayd,
That she long since had vowd to die a Mayde:
Therefore in vaine he labourd, and in vaine
Should sue, if in the end he hop't to gaine
That guerdon, whereton they have only right,
Who under Loves lasciviious banner fight:
And therewith with her faire troope went her way,
Leaving the God behind, who did not stay
Long after her; but wroth that she was gon,
He studied long which way she might be won
Unto his will; like to a gallant Souldier,
Who for the first repulse doth not give over
The fortresse, which to gaine he goes about:
Who thereby more enrag'd, doth waxe more stoute;
And backe returnes, meaning in spight of foes,
To scake the walles, and enter ere he goes.
But after he had long time beate his braine,
And could devise no way how her to gaine,
He vowd the next time that he could come to her,
To use his force, and not his words to woe her.

Within a Wood from ISIS streames a part,
There is a Cave made in despight of art,
So fitly is the growing Marble wrought,
To beautifie the entry of the Vault:
Through this a River glides, whose sandes do show,
LIke those that do in westerne Tagus grow:
Which left the earth some while her selfe to drowne,
Within this darke, but pleasant mansion
Much like the Nubian Niger, which doth slide
In one place under earth of no man spide:
Hither proud Medwaie, one of ISIS traine,
In hunting having lost his company came;
Where, with her dayes toyle over-wearied,
Downe on a bancke she layde her weary head,
Meaning when she had slept awhile, to go
After her lost Companions:  but O
We entend often one thing, when an other
Crosseth our purposes; the which, O there
Was to be seene:  for that place which she thought
Should work her rest, her most disquiet wrought:
Because a Satire that before had spide her,
Taking the Vault when she thought none had eyed her,
Who did imagine she was Phoebus sister:
And with Endimion, who had often kist her,
Appoynted there to meete, whereby they might
Reape that same harvest, that doth Love delight,
Did follow her:  and had't been true, he then,
Meant to bewray it unto Gods and men:
All in revenge of that disgrace was done,
To Marsius, by the God that guides the Sunne.

But when the fearefull Satire came unto
The entraunce of the Cave, he durst not go
Boldly into't, afrayde least he espied,
His base leawd enterprise might be denied:
But villain-like stale softly to, and peeped
At first there in, where he a Nimph that sleeped
On the bare floare did see, whom straight he knew:
But nor for Phoebe, nor one of her crew.
And woondring at his hap, forgate anon
The Goddesse, and her deare Endimion:
And looke how that same Faun that doated on
Faire Iole, stoode like a senselesse stone,
Scard and amas'd, when softly he had crept,
It being darke where as Alcides stept,
Thinking that he faire Iole had bin,
Cause she was armd with Club and Lions skin.
So stood this Satire for a while astond,
Viewing the sleeping Nimph on the bare ground:
Yet that unlookt-for change pleasd him so well,
That straight to toying on her lippes he fell,
Whereby he causd her from her sleepe awake;
Where she spying this Satire, straight gan quake,
And stood even like, if that the like might bee:
Scard and amased at this companie,
Like Gadian Spaniards when as they did see,
The valiant English by their chivalrie,
Caesarean conquerours of their towne before,
They are suspected they had gaind their shore.
Or like to him whose fellowes sodainlie,
Stroke with a Dart sent from Joves armorie.

But as the Bride besnarled in the net,
Which the false Fowler closely for her let,
Altho fast bound, yet flutters with her winges,
And to be gone, standes byting of the stringes:
So did she with her tender force withstand,
And strugled strongly both with foote and hand,
Thinking her selfe thereby againe to free
Away out of his brutish companie;
And with sharpe wordes revilde him, to maintaine
Her honour spotlesse, but twas all in vaine:
For the young Satire fealt she was unable,
Beeing so tender bond, with him to graple:
Yet seeing her so hot, and out of quiet,
And very desirous for to put her by it,
So gently as he could he askt her why,
She so should hate the harmelesse Satirie?
Who answered straight, Their foule deformed shapes,
Their manners rude, unfit for Maydens laps;
Did make her loath their vile base companie:
To which the Satire foorthwith did replie.

Sweete Nimph (quoth he) What?  is it these that grow
Foorth of our forheads, that dislike you so?
(Poynting unto his little hornes) If these?
That God which conquerd India, and did please
The Candian Queene, had such:  or if too red
My face doth seeme?  know Phoebus from the bed
Of his faire Love arysing, redder farre
Doth looke; yet rode he oft in Climens Carre.
But happily, nor these our Hornes nor Face,
But these our hayrie Breastes, worke our disgrace:
Which I confesse are rough, but like his Breast
Where lovely Venus oft hath stolne her rest.
Nor should we ought the more ill shapen seeme,
Because Goate-like wee cloven footed beene,
Since Cupids mother is wed unto him,
That hath a pool-foote, and halts of a lim.
And well I wot, wee Jove our shape did take
When to Antiope he love did make:
Therefore I must conclude, if Nature had
This perfect shape of ours imperfect made,
Because in heaven and earth the like there are,
Mongst God and men to be excus'd it were:
This sayd, he threw her downe upon the sand,
For, O her force too weake was to withstand:
And there in spight of her, he puld the flower,
The fragrant Rose, which neare before the hower;
(Tho ofted sought) by any was obtayned:
Hard was her hap that so vile slave it gained.
That done, he shooke her off, as great men now,
Those that their turnes have served use to do;
And thence departed, leaving her full woe,
And sorrowfull behind, for she did know,
She like the Rose, was cropt from native stem,
Whose vertues wholy lost, do nor younge men,
Nor lovely Maydes delight, or ought content
Either for shew, or for their pleasing sent.
Yet went she home againe, but did not tell,
What hard misfortune was to her befell,
But proudly, as before, when she was free;
Shee presseth next her Mistris still to bee,
And jets it by her side; she never showde
By any actions she awry had trode.
Nor did her fellowes ere her fault perceive:
So studied she their eyesight to deceive.

Yet after this, scarce Phoebe the ninth time
Had showne her selfe to this our northerne Clime,
When Isis almost fainting thorow heate,
And hunting in the chace, being in a sweate:
By chaunce a faire and pleasant Lawne espyed,
Through midst of which a shallow Brooke did slide:
And liking well the place, the upper brimme,
Toucht with her foote, and finding coole and trimme
The water, willed all her Maydens there,
To bath themselves, which when Medwaie did heare,
She hung the head, afraid she should bewray,
That yet none knew, and onely sought delay,
Till jealous Thamis whether she would or no,
Cause her Maydes her garments to undo;
Where, with her naked body straight was showne,
Her shame; the which unwilling to have knowne,
She covered with her hands:  but all servd nought,
Twas knowne, and she confest where it was wrought:
Desiring pardon, cause twas forced on her,
And gainst her will, she duffred that dishonour.

But as Diana raged when she knew
Calisto, one of her faire retinew
By Jove was forced; so did ISIS now:
And straight commaunded her from thence to goe,
And tolde her for her leawd fact angered,
That whether to the Northerne Pole she fled,
Where windie Boreas doth dayly strow
The tops of Hyperborean hilles with Snow:
Or to the Tropicks, where Apollos torch
With extreame heate the sandy ground doth scortch:
Yet therefore should she not escape or flie
The just reward of her hypocrisie,
Which could so vilde a fact so long time hide,
From being by her, or her fellowes spide.
Which when poore Medwaie heard, discomfited;
Unwitting what to doe; for feare halfe dead:
From thence she traveld by uncertaine wayes,
Like a great Shippe in the wide Ocean Seas;
Whose stately Maste being spent, and proud Sayles lost,
Is by each wave hither and thither tost:
And still bewailde her miserable state,
Her wretched life brought to so low a rate:
Life seeming long to folke in miserie,
But short to those live in felicitie.
Yet comfortlesse as she was, like that wight,
Which on the high Alpes, having lost by night
His way, and knoweth not which hand to turne,
Sits on a Bancke, where while as he doth mourne
His happes unto the sable mantled Skies,
Farre off some Sheapheards by a fier espies,
She farde; hearing the jangling of a Bell:
Following the which, she came unto a Cell,
Amidd the shadow of faire spreading trees:
Through which did breath a coole refreshing brees,
Where the woods Burgeses did dayly sing
Sweete Laies unto a pleasant purling Spring,
That thereby ranne:  which pleasing melodie
Might well delight, with his rare harmonie
Each mortall creature; whereas she did see
An olde Man clad in russet, on his knee,
Devoutly mumbling Mattens:  which good sight,
At that time cheard her over dulled spright:
And till his mourning dueties he had ended,
At the entrance of the Cell she him attended:
Which finisht, in she went, whom when he spied,
What wight she was much mus'd, and more her eied.
All in astoond, for sillie man he nere
Before that time, like strange sight had seene there.

If she some Goddesse were, he wist not well;
For of strange Goddesses he had heard tell,
That would leave hautie heaven, and resort
To earthly Springes and Groves, to take their sport.
Or if some Nimph to neighbour-woods belnging,
He did not know; yet for he had a longing
To wit what mister wight she was, he did,
After he thither had her welcome bid,
Intreate her shew, by knowing, which quoth he,
You may be duely honoured by me?
To which, Medwaie revived by's courtesie,
Him mildly answered:  Father take not me
For other then a wretched wight, opprest
With mightie griefe, who crave but roome to rest,
Till wearie limbes I have refresht againe,
Wherewith from foorth her eyes great shewes of raine
Fell downe her blubbred cheekes, whereat th' old man
Rewing her sad distressed state, began
Entreat her tell the causes of her grief.
Who (sighing) did her fortunes tell in briefe,
Both how the Satire in the Cave had us'd her,
And how therefore her Mistris had refus'd her:
Which when the olde man heard, rewing her paine:
Alas faire daughter (quoth he) do not plaine,
For plaintes in these extreames do nothing vaile:
And tis not good in vaine to weepe and waile.
What woman, know there is no maladie
So hard to cure, but hath his remedie.
Jove doth not alwayes foorth his thunder cast,
Nor still doth the hot raging Sommer last,
Still Boreas doth not with impetuous sway,
Raise mighty tempestes in the Ocean Sea.
Nor will these sorrowes dayly on thee tende,
Thy patience prowd away from thee they'll wende.
All humaine accidents about do wheele,
And in one place do never sojorne still,
No more then this great heav'n which dayly wee,
To turne with an unwearie course do see:
Then even as Heaven the which is Fortunes sourse,
About the earth doth keepe a lasting course:
So must we thinke those fortunes which do fall,
Bred by high heaven; yet not perpetuall.
Cold Winter past, the healthy Spring doth come,
Then cholericke Sommer, after sicke Autum:
Nor doth the influence of the heavens each hower,
Downe in one place still good or bad lucke power:
Therefore sad Nimph, since what is thee befall,
Thou canst by no art backe againe recall,
Comfort thy selfe, and hope that God will send
To these thy greife, when he sees time, an end.
In the meane season, and till thou have reard
Th' unwieldy burthen, and thy selfe hast cheard,
Stay heere with me.  So down he wild her sit,
And ease her wearie limbes:  who glad of it,
Did rest her selfe straight on the dustie ground,
As glad so good an harbour she had found
In her great neede; as weather beaten Thrush,
In a great shower is of a sheltring bush.

Not farre from whence where this old man abode,
Downe in a bottome grew a shadie Wood:
By which a River [illeg.] so cleere,
That from the bottome each thing doth appeare
Most lively to the curious gasers sight:
Hither at any time no Shepheard might
Drive his rich fleecie bleating flocke to grase,
For reverence of those Nimphes that haunt the place.
So't fortun'd as sad Medwaie walkt about
One day to ease her greife, she did finde out
This pleasant place, where by the River side,
An entraunce through a stonie Rocke she spide:
To which she went, and did by steps descend,
Into a darksome Hall, through which she wend:
Unto a fayre roome, lightened all by arte,
For under ground it was, and farre apart
From sight of heaven, the things that there made light,
Were precious Carbuncles, and Diamonds bright,
Rich Emeraulds, and Opols discoloured:
About which roome, the antique Images
Were plast, of many worthy personages.

Fame saith, that Merline while he liv'd, did make
(Doating upon a Lady of the lake)
This bowre, by his great skill at her request,
And therein plast the pictures of the best,
And noblest wights that should in Brittaine be,
After his death there sad Medwaie did see,
On one side, the last man bore name of King,
In Brutus long raigning race, who thought to bring
From Armorick, an Host of valiant men,
To foyle the Saxons, that had footing then
In Brittaine tane, had not him Visions stayde,
That wild to Rome his Jorney should be made.

There was that Rhodericke, the great surnamde,
Who for deviding Wales, was highly famde:
and Howel Dha, who auncient lawes corrected,
And Officers to see right done, elected:
With Griffeth Canon, who victorious raigned
Full fiftie yeares; and when  he peace had gayned
Unto his Countrey, dyed:  And Llewelline,
The brave last Prince of auncient Brittish line;
Whose life by them whom he did trust, betrayde;
Altered the government which they had swayde
Two thousand and four hundred yeeres and od.

Aye me, that nought on earth hath his abode,
Heere permanent:  aye me, that one mans fall,
Should be the ruine and decay of all
His house:  aye me, I should have cause to rew
His losse, whose memorie olde greifes renew.

On th' other side, in lively Tables were
Pictures of Noble-men, and Ladyes faire:
Among all which, those seemd the liveliest,
That should live under Faire ELIZA'S rest:
Who though a Woman, yet beyonde compare
Of all the Princes in the world that are:
For in her raigne Arachne busely,
Maketh her webs in rusty Armorie:
And mightie Staves by rotten Woormes are eaten,
For want of use, that death had wont to threaten.

These when she had oreseene, she further went,
And to an other Roome thereby had ment
To goe, wherein the carved Pictures were,
Of those that Englands royall Crowne should weare:
And reached at the Key that thereby hung,
But could not moov't, so to the wall it clung:
For that same entraunce, cause she was no Mayde,
(Like the faire Empresse who the Sceptre swayde)
Was her denied, for so by hidden skill
Of Magicks art, and by infernall spell
Twas framde, that none might have accesse therein,
That were defiled with Venerian sinne:
Onely she hapt through the Key-hole to spie
The fairest Picture that she ere did see.

The counterfeict of Englandes Soveraigne,
ELIZABETH, thrice happy in her raigne:
Under whose rule her Subjects not desier
To change their state of womanish Empire:
Who whilst hatefull Erinnis hell doth leave,
And both with fier and sword her neighbours greeve;
And in the mumure of a cruell storme,
Which threates the machine of the world to harme:
In peace and quiet doth her Realme maintaine;
Supressing Will, and suffering Justice raigne.

Thou most bright Sunne of this our Nothern clime,
Live thou for ever, or live Nestors time,
To maintaine Artes, as hitherto th'ast done;
For wayle the Muses must when thou art gone:
And if it fortune that at any time,
(Luckely) this ragged and unpolisht Rithme,
Into those faire hands fall, that holdes the bridle,
With which thou justly rulest many people;
Behold it with a favourable eie,
And thinke that none can praise thee worthelie.

After the Nimph perceived she was denied
The entraunce of that roome, she would abide
No longer there, but left the enchaunted place;
And thought returne, and shew what she that space
Had seene, unto her Hoast:  but being wearie
Of that unweeldie burthen she did carrie,
She sate downe to rest, and by and by,
Was faine for helpe unto Lucina cry:
Who hearing her, straight came, and with her goes
Some other Nimphes, to helpe  her in her throwes:
Where they to get her, speaking words of ease,
Did from her wombe a little babe release.
Which by and by they laide in mother's lap,
Who with salt teares gan thus to waile her hap.
O cruell Mistris (quoth shee) that exilde me,
When a rude Satire gainst my will beguilde me.
Making me wander like a vacabone.
Through darke woods and ore bleere hills unknowne:
Or like a Ghost, whose freinds forgotten have,
The sencelesse corpse to burie in a grave.
Well hoped I for my long service don,
A better guerdon then this, to have won:
But hopte in vayne; for woe!  my cursed fate
I now do finde:  but dine it all too late.
Who serveth thankelesse folke, shal be rewarded
Not as they hopte, nor as they have deserved.
More had she saide, had she not bin by him
Even then surpriz'd, that long to Thams had bin
A wearie suter, who then from his Sonne
Old Proteus, the skilfull God, did come.

Deepe in the Ocean, where yet never ground,
By longest fadome [illeg.] could ere be found:
Under a hollow Rocke, ther is a vault,
By often beating of great Billowes wrought:
So that it seemes to be the noble acte,
Of some rare Mason, or skild Architect:
About which secret Cave, do daly lorke
Amid the Rockes, the monstrous cruell Orke:
The admirable Whale, which with great rore,
An other Sea into the Sea doth poure:
All with the dead-sleepe charming cold Torpil,
That knowes he carries in his flancke, that wil
Deceave the traitrous Fisher of his pray:
And Scolopenders, who into the Sea
(Caught with sharpe hooks) their entrails foorth do cast:
And when the hookes are found, and daunger past,
Receive them in againe, where as each one
His office holdes, as he before had done.
There dwels old Proteus, who by his great skill,
In the deepe secrets of blacke Magicke, will
Commaund Apollo staie his foaming horse,
Pluck downe heavens stars, and stop faire Cinthias course:
And can great Pluto in his Realme affright,
When ere him list, to shew his powerfull might.
Heere had old Neptune bin, but then his arte prov'd vaine:
His Circles, Characters, straunge words, all usde
In order number, time, his will refusde:
For sure that arte hath no power ore the soule,
Nor doth the world afoard an hearbe so foule:
Or potion made of poysoned Minerall,
That can the minde unwilling, make loves thrall:
Which made Joves Brother discontent, thence part,
Dispayring ere to ease his greivous smart:
Since then, his hopes did faile, but as he went,
He heard a woman wofully lament,
With pitteous plaintes her greevous martyrdome:
And going that way whence the plaintes did come,
Distressed Medwaie he did hap to spie,
Bewayling of her Babies myserie.
Whose sight did comfort him that hoped by her,
He might worke meanes to slake his tortring fier:
Which to effect and bring about the sooner,
Knowing her fortunes, thus he straight gan wooe her.

The much griefe (quoth he) I have boren long,
Makes me the more to rue thy too much wrong,
Sad Nimph, all undeserved (I wot) by thee:
Wherefore if thou'lt, devise, and but tell me
How I may quench these fiers in my brest,
By fraude or force I passe not, I protest,
Of all those many Sea-gods waite on mee,
The choise and comliest Ile bestowe on thee,
To be thy Husband, in thy Mistris place.
This said, straight Medwaie gan to waigh her case,
And sadly counts the wronges she had endured,
The great disgraces nere to be recured:
All by her Mistris, all without desart,
As she did judge; yet judg'd she not her part,
Traytrously fell her to her greatest foe,
Though by her sh'ad bin wronged farre much more:
But, but a small while that thought did possess her,
So much did Neptunes promis'd husband press her,
'Twould seeme sh'ad not forgot the sport was made
Late in the Cave, how ere at last she sayde:
If to that place great God where sometime you,
With all the Sea-gods of your retinue,
Were by Ocean richly entertained,
When he proud Thetis to his first wife gained:
Do go to morrow ere the fierie Sunne
The harnesse from his horses hath undunne:
There you that cruell Lady straight shall finde,
That to us both hath prooved too unkinde.
Where having caught her, you may force her stench
Your bleeding woundes, and burning fiers quench.
But be you sure to catch her by some sleight,
Else will she scape you (for she's woondrous wight)
And serve you as Coronis hath tofore,
When she out ran you on Phocaion shore:
But poore soule shee, no sooner tolde this tale,
When Neptune being afeard the time would faile,
If he would longer stay, in hast did hie
To seeke his love; which when Medwaie did see,
Repenting (but too late) that ever he,
Had here deceaved by his flatterie;
Even as a wilde Bull darted by some one,
Begins to roare, and up and downe to runne
Amid the presse, all feareless of his harme:
So Medwaie vext, cause he did not performe
His oath; and for her fault in conscience stunge,
Voyde of all patience, furilike flunge,
And oft for spight, her body threw to ground,
Till at the last, she with her selfe did take
A truce, and summoned sad wordes, to make
Her sorrowes knowne; with which the quiet skie
She vext, and sighing, thus at last gan crie,

O foolish, that I was foolish and madd,
To thinke that false forsworen Neptune had
Fayth in his wordes, or to imagine hee,
(Changing his nature) would be true to mee.

You hollow Caves, grim Plutoes auncient place,
You hellish furies, blacke nightes ougly race:
Infernall Floodes, O plundge mee deepe into
The bottome of that hot abisme, where lie
Tormented Ghostes in wretched miserie.

O thou the guyder of the golden light,
O thou faire Queene that cleerely shinst by night,
And you bright Starres that wander in the Skies,
If you have power over our Destenies,
And that you be both of our good and ill,
The onely authors, then togither will
So many mischiefs on my head to light,
As can, or may, upon a wretched wight.
And thus as shee lamented in despaire,
Her tattered Garments shee in peeces taire:
And her two snow-white handes plaighted together,
Enrag'd she wrong, and thumped without measure.
Her tender Armes against the senselesse ground,
And her small Babe (strange tale) being unbound,
And layde along upon the soft greene gras;
No sooner toucht the earth, but straight wayes was
Ore-growne with with earth, and from her tooes out went
Small writhing rootes in unquoth wonderment.
And her small body being lessoned,
Into a small long stalke was fashioned.
To Flagges her fingers changed and last of all,
Her Head turnd to that plant we Cats-taile call.

Which wondrous change, when Medwaie saw, she mourned
Cause to so vile a plane the Gods had turnd
Her guiltlesse Babe; till at last even she
Did like to snow, that on the Alps doth lie
All Winter time; which when as westerne windes,
Together with the warmth of Sunne unbindes,
The clodded lumpes so water straight doth change,
Making small Brookes, as downe the hill it doth range:
For she consuming unto watrie teares,
Was to a River turnde, the which now beares
Th' unfortunate Nimphes name, fall'n by the fault,
Which in the Cave was by the Satire wrought.
