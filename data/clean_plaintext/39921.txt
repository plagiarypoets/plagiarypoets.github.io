Ye lovers of Science lament,
No longer must Coughron impart,
What deep in rich nature lies pent,
E'en truths of mysterious art.

A worthy acquaintance to all,
His passions were gen'rous and free;
Renowned, and great in his fall,
Nor saw more than years twenty-three.

On banks of meandering Tweed
The youth first would nature define;
But (urg'd by Minerva) agreed
To rifle her stores on the Tyne.

Each artist his aid wou'd implore,
Affirming him prince of the train;
Who could with such majesty soar,
As witness his CURVE on the plane.

His Phillis was heard in the groves,
Crying, "He that could please is no more;"
Thro' fields of Elysium he roves,
The king of all kings to adore!

His judgment, his genius how great;
His reasoning faculty strong:
A lawyer, an artist compleat,
And worthy, thrice worthy my song.

His praise future ages will ring,
Yea myriads of Coughron will tell;
In strains undulating they'll sing,
How wreathed with laurels he fell.
