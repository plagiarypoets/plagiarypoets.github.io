O Thou!  that with thy drowsy Wand
Canst wakeful Eyes to Rest command,
Suspend the Lover's anxious Care,
And make a Truce with black Despair;

While thy Mimic Pow'r, of Shapes
Numberless, that in the Cell
Of the busy Fancy dwell,
Pleasing Dreams and Visions makes:

Tell me from what glorious Store
Thou has brought the richest Form
That did ever Night adorn,
Or visit Sleeping Minds before.

So like BELPHOEBE, so Divine
Did the beauteous Image shine,
Wretched TIMIAS thought him blest;
&mdash;Of the heavenly Dame possest.

Sweet it look'd, and so it smil'd
As when first th' indulgent Maid
My unwary Heart beguil'd
And to fatal Love betray'd.

SLEEP!  why shou'd'st Thou thus deceive
One too easy to believe?
Why with His vain Hopes conspire
To flatter thus his fond Desire?

Rather let him see Disdain
In her angry Looks appear;
In her Eyes the Tokens clear
Of sad Resolves t' encrease his Pain.

In some hated Ghost, whose Pride
Thousand hapless Souls have sigh'd;
That knows to frown; put on the Face,
And BELPHOEBE's borrowed Grace.

Bid the haughty Shadow come,
(In her Voice and in her Mein
An Unusual Fierceness seen)
Sternly to pronounce his Doom.

Then, perhaps, from hopeless Love
Thou his wretched Mind may'st move;
Or thy Brother DEATH release,
Whom in vain You strive to ease.

But if the Hand, that shou'd save,
Never will the Cure apply,
Let him then sleep in his Grave;
Let a Wretch despair and die!

But if You with pow'rful Art
Can soften Minds, and change the Thought;
That BELPHOEBE may be brought
To sigh, and love, and feel my smart:

Then may oft such Dreams return,
When in Mutual Fires we burn;
Till our Hands and Hearts shall join,
And I shall Ever call Her Mine!
