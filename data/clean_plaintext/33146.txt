Happy happie Fishers swaine[s]
If that yee knew your happines;
Your sport tasts sweeter by your paines,
Sure hope your labour relishes;
Your net your living, when you eate
Labour finds appetite and meat.

When the seas and tempest roare
You eyther sleepe or pipe or play,
And dance along the golden shore:
Thus you spend the night and day;
Shrill windes a pipe, hoarse seas a taber
To fit your sports or ease your labour.

First ah first the holy Muse
Rap't my soules most happy eyes,
Who in those holy groves doe use
And learne those sacred misteries
The yeares and months, old age and birth,
The palsies of the trembling earth.

The flowing of the sea and Moone
And ebbe of both, and how the tides
Sinke in themselves and backward run.
How palled Cynthia closely slides,
Stealing her brother from our sight,
So robs herself and him of light.

But if cold natures frozen parts,
My dull slow heart and cloudie braine,
Cannot reach those heavenly [ar]ts,
Next happie is the fishers paine
Whose lo[w] roofes peace doe safely hide
And shut out fortune, want and pride.

There shall I quiet fearelesse raigne,
My boyes my subjects taught submission,
[A  b]o[a]t my court, my sonnes my traine,
Nets my purvaiors of provision,
The steere my sceptre, pipe musition,
Labour my Phisicke, no Phisitian.

So shall I laugh the angry seas and skie:
Thus singing may I live, and singing die.
