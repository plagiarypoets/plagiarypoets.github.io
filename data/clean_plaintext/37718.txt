Child of the sunny lockes and beautifull brow!
In thoughtfull tendernesse I gaze on thee&mdash;
Upon thy daintie cheek Expression's glow
Daunceth in tyme to thine heart's melodie;
Ne mortall wight mote lovelier urchin see!
Nathlesse it teens this pensive brest of mine
To think &mdash; belive the innocent revelrie
Shall be eclipsed in those soft blue eyne&mdash;
Whenso the howre of youth no more for thee shall shine.

Ah me!  eftsoon thy childhood's pleasaunt dais
Shall fly away, and be a whilome thing!
And sweetest mearimake, and birthday lais
Be reck'd not of, except when memories bring
Feres to their embers with awaking wing,
To make past love rejoyce thy tender sprite,
Albeit the toyles of daunger thee enring!
Child of the wavy lockes, and brow of light&mdash;
Then be thy conscience pure, as now thy face is bright.
