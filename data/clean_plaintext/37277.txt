Now spring returns, but brings no more to me
The pleasure it was wont; each ling'ring ray
Of hope is fled, and now I hate to see
All nature seem so beautiful, so gay:&mdash;
Dark autumn suits me best.  To sit and hear
The howlings of the wind at midnight's hour,
Or watch the falling leaf, so dry and sear,
Possesses for my soul a soothing power.
I love its clouded skies so dark and drear,
For there's no brightness then to mock my sight,
With promises of bliss and visions of delight.

Yet once I loved thee, Spring, when life was new,
And hope was bright, and I believed its truth:
I prized each picture my fond fancy drew,
And deem'd that pleasure was the boon of youth.
But ah!  since then the chilling hand of care
Has withered all my hopes, my joys are flown,
And I can gaze on things so bright and fair,
With heart unmoved as the cold marble stone.
My soul is sunk in sullen, calm despair,
And autumn's gloomy scenes can charm me now,
More than the Spring's young bloom, or Summer's ripened glow.
