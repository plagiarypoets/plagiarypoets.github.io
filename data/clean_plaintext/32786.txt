I that obscur'd have fled the Sceane of Fame, 
Intitling my conceits to nought but care, 
I that have liv'd a Phoenix in loves flame, 
And felt that death I never would declare, 
Now mount the Theater of this our age, 
To plead my faith and Cupids cursed rage.

Oh you high sp'rited Paragons of witte, 
That flye to fame beyond our earthly pitch, 
Whose sence is sound, whose words are feat and fitte, 
Able to make the coyest eare to itch: 
Shroud with your mighty wings that mount so well, 
These little loves, new crept from out the shell.

And thou the true Octavia of our time, 
Under whose worth, beauty was never matched, 
The Genius of my Muse and ragged rime, 
Smile on these little loves but lately hatched, 
Who from the wrastling waves have made retreate, 
To pleade for life before thy judgement seate.

And tho the fore-bred brothers they have had, 
(Who in theyr Swan-like songes Amintus wept) 
For all their sweet-thought sighes had fortune bad, 
And twice obscur'd in Cinthias circle slept: 
Yet these (I hope) under your kind aspect, 
(Most worthy Lady) shall escape neglect.

And if these Infants of mine artlesse braine, 
(Not by theyr worth, but by thy worthinesse) 
A meane good liking of the learned gaine, 
My Muse enfranchis'd from forgetfulnesse: 
Shall hatch such breede in honour of thy name, 
As moderne Poets shall admire the same.

As moderne Poets shall admire the same, 
I meane not you (you never matched men) 
Who brought the Chaos of our tongue in frame, 
Through these Herculean labours of your pen: 
I meane the meane, I meane no men divine, 
But such whose feathers are but waxt like mine.

Goe weeping Truce-men in your sighing weedes, 
Under a great Mecaenas I have past you: 
If so you come where learned Colin feedes 
His lovely flocke, packe thence and quickly haste you; 
You are but mistes before so bright a sunne, 
Who hath the Palme for deepe invention wunne.

Kisse Delias hand for her sweet Prophets sake, 
Whose not affected but well couched teares: 
Have power, have worth, a Marble minde to shake; 
Whose fame, no Iron-age or time out weares. 
Then lay you downe in Phillis lap and sleepe, 
Untill she weeping read, and reading weepe.
