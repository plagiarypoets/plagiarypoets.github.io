SPENSER*.
ELEGIAC.
Like as a Huntsman, after weary chace,
Seeing the Game from him escape away,
Sits down to rest him in some shady place
With panting Hounds beguiled of their prey:

So, after long pursute and vain assay
When I long weary had the chace forsook
The gentle Deer return'd the self-same way
Thinking to quench her thirst in the next brook:

Then She, beholding me with milder look,
Sought not to flee, but fearless still did bide:
Till I in hand her, yet half trembling, took
And with her own good will her firmly tide.
Strange thing me seem'd to see a Beast so wild
So goodly won; with her own will beguil'd.

* This Sonnet, if I recollect, is beautifully set by GREEN.
