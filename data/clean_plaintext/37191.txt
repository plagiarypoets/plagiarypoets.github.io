Th' experienc'd sailor long inur'd to danger,
Rides over Death, nor heeds his stern array;
Life's youthful voyager, to fear a stranger,
Through paths of equal peril journeys gay;
But ah!  how often doth he turn astray,
Following fair bubbles all around him curling,
Lur'd by the lustre of their foamy play&mdash;
While the fix'd mariner, his sails unfurling,
Bent on the port, pursues his destined way!

May I, who gaze upon this beauteous ocean,
An early sorrower!  not coldly brave,
Nor yet, as once, with fond and blind devotion,
Of Hope's young treacheries, the willing slave&mdash;
May I be thankful for the wreck I save!
And since I know how fatally alluring,
May I ne'er tempt again the smiling wave,
But with firm mind each passing change enduring,
Look to a haven, that's beyond the grave!
