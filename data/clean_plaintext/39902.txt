Now Spring's (chearful season) return'd,
Be joyous, ye sons of the spray;
Why longer should Nature be mourn'd?
Come, Phillis, and listen my lay.

O come, my delight and my love,
Thy shepherd no artfulness knows;
The wreath that you yesterday wove,
To day shall be fix'd on my brows.

And Flora shall lend me her stores,
(For Flora must shortly be here)
To crown thee, my fair one, with flow'rs,
Such crowns, even goddesses wear.

See, see how the primroses grow,
What violets the hedges adorn;
Already the sloe-bushes blow,
Diffusing their sweets to the morn.

Bright Phoebus in golden array,
Revisits our borders again,
Ye villager virgins be gay,
Be jovial, each jocular swain.
