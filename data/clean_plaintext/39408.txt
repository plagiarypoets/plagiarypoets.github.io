Poet of Nature, hail!  Thy thrilling lay
Falls on my heart; and, for a while, subdues
The sense of care, that each returning day
Wakes me to know.  Led by thy gentle muse,
And Fancy's magic aid, once more I stray
'Mid fair Devonia's shades, and gaze anew
On each enchanting scene, that charm'd my youthful view.

Belov'd Devonia!  In life's halcyon hours,
'Twas mine to wander in thy lovely vales;
Where early spring expands her infant flow'rs,
And health comes wafted on the tepid gales.
And still I love thee, though my feeble pow'rs
Fail when I strive to speak that love, or tell
How oft, on days gone by, fond mem'ry loves to dwell.

Haunts of my youth!  hills, dales, and devious streams!
Farewell!  perchance for aye. &mdash; For me no more
You spread your varied charms &mdash; yet oft in dreams
Does wakeful Fancy all those charms restore,
Glowing and bright &mdash; as when Sol's orient beams,
In Summer morn, illume the eastern sky
With the swift-changing tints, that mock the gazer's eye.

Devonia!  thou canst boast full many a name
To art and genius dear &mdash; names that shall live
In days remote:  and, lo!  the voice of Fame
To Carrington, the deathless meed shall give
He breathes a lofty strain, and well may claim
To rank with proudest bards, whose verse sublime
Shall live, till Nature sinks, subdu'd by conq'ring Time.

Patrons of Genius!  say, shall care, shall pain,
Prey on a heart that feels the sacred glow
Of inspiration?  Shall so pure a strain,
To taste and virtue true, unheeded flow?
No!  be it yours to bid a cheering train
Of new-born hopes arise; till, free as air,
His buoyant spirit soar above the reach of care.
