When Venus saw Mythella's face,
Adorn'd with ev'ry beauteous grace,
Her bosom heav'd a conscious sigh,
Fierce envy glisten'd in her eye;
"Those charms, she cried, presuming maid,
Those blooming beauties soon shall fade,
That rose that blushes in your cheek,
Those lillies whit'ning on your neck,
Those eyes," she said, and wing'd with malice flew,
Swift as an arrow from the toughest yew.

Where female envy rears her head
'Midst beauties wither'd, graces dead;
Here lay Matilda's curling hair,
Here Chloe's shape, there Caelia's air;
Here Sacarissa's well-turn'd arm,
And many a wither'd, faded charm.
These kill'd, by female envy lay,
Hid from th' enliv'ning beams of day:
Attendant furies near the goddess stand,
And wait malignant for her dire command.

While malice struggled in her breast,
Thus female envy she addrest;
"Assist me, goddess, to erase
Each beauty from Mythella's face,
To dim those eyes that dare to shine
In haughty rivalship to mine;
Then Venus will alone remain,
Unrival'd 'midst the beauteous train."
She spoke; while Envy gladen'd at the thought,
And thus addrest her furies, malice-fraught:

"Unchain that dire disease, that dwells
Tortur'd 'midst mangled beauties yells,
That dire disease, that speckling harms
With venom'd breath all mortal charms."
The list'ning furies heard her voice,
Unchain'd the fiend with hideous noise;
The dreadful monster growl'd delight,
And instant took his airy flight
Thro' croud of females, as he hissing past,
Each trembling fair one fear'd the monster's blast.

But when the fiend Mythella saw,
In her he fix'd his deadly claw,
Now fair Mythella soon had fell
A victim to this fiend of hell;
When lo!  appear'd a lovely maid,
In milk white, snowy vest array'd,
Her ruddy cheek with blushes show'd;
While dove-like virgin modesty alone
Smil'd in her face, and in each beauty shone.

'Twas health:  the fiend confess'd her sway;
He grow'ling left his beauteous pray,
And now Mythella shines more bright,
Than th' ev'ning star, or morning light,
And roseate health with crimson dye,
Sits twinkling, sparkling in her eye;
Female envy no more shakes,
With malice fraught, her deadly snakes;
And Venus sighing, yields the golden prize,
The palm of beauty to Mythella's eyes.
