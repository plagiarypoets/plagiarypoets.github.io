'Tis General Nature, in thy art and mine,
Must give our fame in future times to shine:
Sublime and pathos, like the Sun's fix'd flame,
Remain, and please thro' every age the same;
Humour's light shapes, like vapours in the sky,
Rise, pass, and vary, and for ever fly:
HOGARTH and SWIFT, if living, might deplore
Half their keen jokes, that now are jokes no more.

What Truth's rich page of real event supplies,
What Fancy's powers of fabled act devise,
Before the lie &mdash; but where the field so wide,
There Judgment's hand Selection's step must guide.

To Horror's forms the mind aversion feels,
To SPANIOLET'S slay'd saints and torturing wheels;
Nor praise for nauseous images we win,
For SPENSER's Error, or for MILTON's Sin...
