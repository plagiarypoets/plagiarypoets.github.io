Far distant from his native soil,
Where Indian forests gloomy wave,
Where Freedom spurns a tyrant's guile,
And injur'd Merit finds a grave,
In Melancholy's pensive mood
Ill-fated Poland's chieftain stood:
Plow'd was his face with many a scar
In glorious combat nobly won,
When struggling 'midst the rage of war
His falling country bless'd her son;
Indignant wrath his manly bosom fir'd,
And more than mortal power the words of Fate inspir'd.

"Dark be the grave, and thick the clay
On Russia's female tyrant's heart;
Horrors surround in dim array
Both mortal and immortal part;
Tarnish'd with blood, and reeking o'er
With purple crimes and husband's gore;
What tho' thy bands on Helle's shore
Eclips'd the pallid crescent's gleam,
And wide the Arctic banner bore
To Grecian isles from Oby's stream;
Let Poland's free born shades confound thy sight,
And plunge thy conscious soul in everlasting night.

"Prepare the feast for Berlin's king,
Let Mirth and Joy attendants wait;
Triumphal Paeans round him sing
The happy day of Poland's fate;
Raise while you may the enliv'ning strain,
And swell the glories of his reign;
For mark the moments as they fly,
From heaven thy bear the unerring blow,
See Vengeance roll her fiery eye,
And Justice frowning let her go;
Faithless and false, inglorious and unjust,
Thus tumble from thy throne, and moulder in the dust.

"And ye, who with unfeeling stare,
Saw prostrate Virtue bite the ground,
Who stood with breasts devoid of care
When human nature felt the wound;
Shall Time's long annals stamp for shame
Deathless your guilt, accurs'd your name;
Thrice dipt in more than Stygian wave
I see your bloody scourge descend;
Make wide and deep the spacious grave,
For Tyranny shall find an end;
Kingdoms shall flame before Dissention's breath,
And Freedom glorious rise amidst firebrands and death.

"It shakes; the sun is sanguine red;
Convulsions rock this earthly ball;
Ocean unbares its channel'd bed,
And works of Ages tott'ring fall:
See where outstretch'd, of giant size,
O'erthrown, grim Superstition dies!
No more he heaves his dragon head
On classic Tiber's hallow'd shore,
Nor blasts, with foul and noxious shade,
The gentle groves which Brutus bore:
Conquer'd at last, and ratified his doom,
The gloomy North expands to lend a friendly tomb.

"Melting as snow in spring away,
Toss'd round like angry Ocean's foam,
Mark proud Vienna's power decay
The pageant of Almighty Rome;
Languor and fear in ambush wait
Around the dizzy chair of state;
Perch'd o'er the high Cesarean king,
Tyrant of every peopled grove,
The Eagle droops his flagging wing,
No longer found the bird of Jove:
Feeble that sounding clang terrific far,
When all his nations nine burst furious into war.

"Unhappy fields, where once I stray'd
Careless and free, in infant mood,
In flowery mead or sylvan glade,
As yet undy'd with native blood,
What tongue shall tell, what voice relate,
My country's fall, my country's fate!
What tears express the dismal hour
That saw her Heroes all give way,
That plum'd Opression's leagued power;
And sunk her Nobles in the clay,
Proclaim'd Sobieski's awful senate gone,
And dash'd into the dust his Europe-saving throne.

"What though ye now, abject and vile,
Augment the lordly victor's pride,
And o'er your blood be-drenched soil
Behold the insulting foe deride;
Rejoice, your vengeance but delays,
It musters wrath, it brews apace;
Sapp'd underneath by Heaven's decree
See all yon empire headlong borne;
The frozen Pole from fetters free
By more than Hecla's furies torn:
On Wolga's bank and wintry Astracan,
The Sun of Science rear the Sacred Rights of Man.

"Wide spreading mark that gen'rous flame,
More glorious still the more opprest;
It came from Heav'n's most hallow'd beam,
To consecrate the human breast;
Its lightning-glace makes Tyrants quake,
And more than Europe's despots shake;
Inspir'd by this, the hapless brave
To pathless woods and caverns fly,
Welcome with joy the dusty grave,
Or mangl'd, mock'd, unburied lye,
Inspir'd by this, the freeborn heart rebounds,
Exile and Death you turn to weak and empty sounds."

He said; a fairer, brighter gleam
Mantl'd with rays the orient sky;
Heroic shapes embattl'd seem
To float before the dazzl'd eye;
Smiling applause they forward bend;
New life they light, new ardours lend.
Brutus was there, of form divine,
With whom the Roman freedom died;
And He, who on the banks of Rhine
The servile Roman World defy'd;
There dimly great, unhappy Wallace stood,
Who thrice his country's wrongs resisted unto blood.
