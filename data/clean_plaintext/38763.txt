I, who my Royal Master once did save,
And thence the glorious Name of Royal gain'd,
Am now prophan'd by every Peasant Slave,
To deck Rebellion's hideous Brow constrain'd.

Of me the civic Crown, in Days of Yore,
Was form'd for him who 'midst the bloody Fray
Preserv'd a Neighbour press'd in Battle sore;
And by his Valour bore him safe away.

But they that wear me now, wild, frantic, blind,
Their Force against their fastest Friends employ,
Regardless of the Ills that lurk behind,
Headlong they rush, their Country to destroy.

Against the Laws of God and Man they rise,
Pretending Grievances, but feeling none:
God's tender Mercies tow'rds this Isle despise;
Too prosperous grown, they seek to be undone.

Oh!  had they chosen out some baneful Weed,
Which better with their black Designs might suit;
Then from foul Disgrace I had been freed,
And might have still remain'd in high Repute.

But Vengeance shall not sleep!  A chosen Band
Of Men renown'd in Battles shall appear,
And carry Desolation thro' their Land;
And from their Rebel Heads my Foliage tear.

I too will lend my Trunk and spreading Boughs,
Whereon the Catiffs shall suspended swing:
That all may know the Cause which I espouse,
And to my Shrine the proper Off'rings bring.
