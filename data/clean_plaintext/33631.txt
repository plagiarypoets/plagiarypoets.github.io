Our Stone is the Representative of the great World, and hath the Virtues of that great Fabrick, comprised or collected in this little System; it is the virtue Magnetical, attractive of its like in the whole World:  it is the Coelestial Virtue, expounded universally in the whole Creation, but Epitomized in this small Map or Abridgment.
This Virtue or Power is in it self barren, sluggish, dead and unactive, and for this cause it remaineth without fruit; but being loosed by Art, it doth through the co-operation of Nature, produce that Arcanum which hath not its like in the whole World; for it doth heal the imperfections of all Creatures and Metals, taking away their sickness, and restoring them to perfect Health.
The reward which this Mastery will bring to the Artist, is indeed inestimable; for having it, he needs want no worldly blessing, for wealth he need take no care, and from all frailties of Body he hath a most sure Antidote.
Pray then to God, that he would be propitious unto your studies and labours, in giving thee the true knowledge of this secret Mystery; it is the gift of God, I have holpen thee what I can, but venture not to practise barely upon my words, for know that what I have only hinted, is far more then what I have discovered; and what I have declared to thy first apprehension most openly, hath yet its lurking Serpent under the green Grass, I mean some hidden thing which thou oughtest to understand, which thou being Cock-sure at first blush wilt neglect; but yet it will bite thee by the heel when thou approachest to practise, and make thee begin again, and it may be at last throw away all as a man desperate:  for know that this is an Art very Cabalistical, and we do study expressions such as we know will suit almost with any mans fancy, in one place or other; but be sure to take this Maxim from one who knows best the sence of what he hath written:  Where we speak most plainly, there be most circumspect, for we do not go about to betray the Secrets of Nature; especially then in those places which seem to give Receipts so plain as you would desire, suspect either a Metaphor, or else be sure that something or other is supprest, which thou wilt hardly without Inspiration ever find of thy self, which in tryal will make all thy confident knowledge vanish; yet to a Son of Art, we have written that which never heretofore was by any revealed.

Now for a close of this most secret Gate,
Whereat few enter, none but they who are
By Gods grace favour'd; its not luck ne fate
That in disclosing this can claim a share:
It is a portion which is very rare,
Bestow'd on those whom the most High shall chuse,
To such the Truth I freely shall declare,
Nor ought through Envy to them shall refuse,
Nor with unwonted Riddles shall their hopes abuse.

Of uncouth subjects now shall be my Song,
My mind intends high Wonders to reveal,
Which have lain hidden heretofore full long,
Each Artist striving them how to conceal,
Lest wretched Caitiffs should these Treasures steal:
Nor Villains should their Villainies maintain
By this rare Art; which danger they to heal,
In horrid Metaphors veil'd an Art most plain,
Lest each Fool knowing it, should it when known disdain.

Remember Man how he produced was,
How formed from a lump of abject Clay,
From whence Created; he each thing doth pass,
Which next to Angels ever saw the day:
For God in him infus'd so bright a Ray
Of his own Image, which the Body joyn'd
To it, ennobled so that both pourtray
Their Maker, as though Heaven with Earth combin'd
A little System of the Universe to find.

But yet though he of Soul and Body both
Was made, and of the two the nobler part
The Soul by far, which for the most part doth
The subject nominate; yet that same Art
That made so rare a piece, doth from the part
Less noble name the whole, Adam, or Dust,
Wherein a Mystery was couch'd, whose heart
Of life the Centre, to Earth's bowels must
Return, the Earth it self for Man's sake being curs'd.

Right so our Stone containeth Natures two,
One hidden, subtle Soul, Heavens Progeny,
The other gross, compact, terrene also,
Earth's product must to Earth by destiny;
Which when resolv'd is made a feculency
To sight, but the Coelestial part is still
(Though over-clouded) most pure inwardly,
And shall at last most Pearlie drops distill,
Which shall the barren Earth with fruit in plenty fill.

Thus all our Secrets from the Earth do flow,
'Tis Earth which for our Base at first we take,
Our Water also unto Earth must go,
And both together must a Limus make,
Which we with respite by our Art must bake,
Till all become a Spirit glorify'd,
Whose firmness wasting, time shall never shake;
By perfect union th' are so surely ty'd,
Each Element the other three within it self doth hide.

Take then that thing which Gold we please to call,
But 'tis not Gold, yet Gold it is in truth;
Metalline 'tis, yet from a Mineral
It flows, which Art by Nature holp renew'th,
And to a Fool an ugly face it sheweth;
Yet to a Son of Art it lovely seems,
'Tis Stellar white, and tender in his youth,
And vile appears in many mens esteems,
Yea the most part of men it for a trifle deems.

From it is made a subject of great price,
Shew it the Goldsmith and he'l swear 'tis Gold;
But look you sell it not, if you be wise,
The Basis 'tis of Secrets manifold,
This for their secret main the Sages hold:
The like is in Gold digged from the Mine,
But to procure it is scarce to be told,
That you may understand, though every line
Were plainly wrote, yet might your practice oft decline.

For 'tis a Labour hardly to be borne,
So many tricks and turnings in it be,
And he that tryeth it is surely forlorne,
Unless a crafty Master, credit me;
For I have tryed both, yet could not see
How any in this way can be secure:
I therefore who have vowed secrecy
Have writ this way, which we can scarce endure
For knowledge-sake to try, its ease will none allure.

Our Kingly road I also hinted have,
Our way in which a Fool can hardly erre,
Our secret way, which much sad toyl will save,
Which is so easie, that I may averr,
If thou shouldst see it, thou wouldst it preferr
To any Earthly pleasure; yet beware
That you mistake not, for I do averr,
A mingled Doctrine these lines do declare,
For both ways in this Book of mine do claim a share.

Learn to distinguish every sentence well,
And know to what Work it doth appertain;
This is great skill, which few as I can tell
By all their reading, yet could ere attain,
And yet of Theory this is the main:
Also to know accordingly to give
Due heat, which in one way thou must be fain
T' increase ten-fold, thou mayst me well believe,
For what doth one decoct, t' other away will drive.

Also their Operations different
Appear, the one thou must sublime and boyl,
O tedious way!  in which much time is spent,
And many errours, which the Work will spoyl:
The other silently doth make no toyl,
Like the still voice which to Eliah came,
About which Work thou needest not to broyl,
Nor wantst thou Fiery Vulcan's parching flame,
A far more gentle heat begins and ends this Game.

But if thou canst each work perform apart,
And knowst them afterward to reconcile,
Then art thou Master of a Princely Art,
The very success will thy hopes beguile;
Thou hast all Natures Works rankt on a File,
And all her Treasures at command dost keep,
On thee the Fates shall never dare but smile,
No Mystery is now for thee too deep,
Th' art Natures Darling, whether thou dost wake or sleep.

Pardon my plainness, if the Art thou knowst,
'Twas the fruit of my untame desire
To profit many; and without a boast,
No man above my Candour shall aspire:
My zeal was kindled with Minerva's Fire,
And thou who to this Art wilt now apply,
My Book in Natures way shall lead thee higher,
Then ever thou shalt favour'd be by Destiny.

Peruse these lines, and being read, review
And read again, and on them meditate,
Each reading shall fresh Mysteries and new
Discover, which are scatter'd in each Gate;
For they so linked are, that all relate
To each, and we our words have woven so,
That thou mayst soon erre by misleading Fate,
Unless for to distinguish thou do know;
Remember that 'mongst Briars thick, sweet Roses grow.
