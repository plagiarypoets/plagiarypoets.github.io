An others came. &mdash; Desires and Adorations,
Wing'd Persuasions, and veil'd Destinies,
Splendours, and Glooms, and glimmering Incantations
Of hopes and fears, and twilight Phantasies;
And Sorrow, with her family of Sighs;
And Pleasure, blind with tears, led by the gleam
Of her own dying smile instead of eyes!

ELEGY
Weep for my Tomcat!  all ye Tabbies weep,
For he is gone at last!  Not dead alone,
In flowery beauty sleepeth he no sleep;
Like that bewitching youth Endymion!
My love is dead, alas, as any stone,
That by some violet-clad smiling river
Weepeth too fondly!  He is dead and gone,
And fair Aurora, o'er her young believer,
With fingers gloved with roses, doth make moan,
And every bud its petal green doth sever,
And Phoebus sets in night for ever, and for ever!
And others come!  ye Splendours!  and ye Beauties!
Ye Raptures  with your robes of pearl and blue;
Ye blushing Wonders!  with your scarlet shoe-ties;
Ye Horrors bold!  with breasts of lily hue;
Ye Hope's stern flatterers!  He would trust to you,
Whene'er he saw you with your chestnut hair,
Dropping sad daffodils; and rosepinks true!
Ye Passions proud!  with lips of bright despair;
Ye Sympathies!  with eyes like evening star,
When on the glowing east she rolls her crimson car.

Oh, bard-like spirit!  beautiful and swift!
Sweet lover of pale night; when Luna's lamp
Shakes sapphire dew-drops through a cloudy rift;
Purple as woman's mouth, o'er ocean damp;
Thy quivering rose-tinged tongue &mdash; thy stealing tramp;
The dazzling glory of thy gold-tinged tail;
Thy whisker-waving lips, as o'er the swamp
Rises the meteor, when the year doth fail,
Like beauty in decay, all, all are flat and stale.
