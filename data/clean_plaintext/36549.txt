Sweet is the social hour when eident toil
Has made the business of the day complete,
When cordial friendship lends her seraph smile,
And humour bland lights up the moments fleet;
And temperance fills the cup of comfort, meet
To chase the vapours dank that often lie
On hearts of finest mould, and genius sweet,
With learning join'd, throws out the rich supply
Of thoughts that melt the heart, or steel the purpose high.

But if it is by idleness profan'd,
Or in a tempest of delirious joy
Blown up, where no good purpose is obtain'd,
No thought brought forth which wisdom can employ,
Save as a beacon, frowning to annoy
Each future festive moment as it rises;
Or monitor, with gall drops to destroy
The cup of bliss, for fear of new surprises,
'Tis the dark fiend of hell in one of heaven's disguises.
