While CAMS bright Honors courtly Bards reherse,
Chaste ISIS triumphs in her WARTON'S Verse:
Hears ev'ry Grecian, every Latian Rill,
Their Murmurs softned by the Muses Skill;
And AVON boasts, that erst the tuneful Train,
Taught her glad Echos many a deathless Strain.

When that bright Maid, in whose devoted Breast,
The patriot Passion swallow'd all the rest,
ELIZA rose, to quence the Bigots Brand,
And break the Chain that bound Religion's Hand,
Then free-born Reason beam'd the heav'nly Smile
That call'd fair Science to her fav'rite Ile.
Then Learning saw the magic Prison fall,
And sprung to Liberty at BACON'S Call:
In Arts, and Arms, accomplish'd SIDNEY shone,
Nor HOOKER reign'd in sacred Lore alone;
Then RALEIGH rose, whose now resplendent Name,
Let JAMES'S Annals tell with Pride and Shame:
Reign'd JOHNSON then, the MARTIUS of the Stage,
And manner'd FLETCHER charm'd th' admiring Age.
Thou, museful SPENSER tun'dst thy Dorian Lays,
And taught'st in mystic Gloriana's Praise,
That ev'ry Labor virtuous Fame beguil'd,
And smil'd on all whom ELIZA smil'd.
Hero's, like Suns, thus lend their Light and Heat,
To Stars of Genius which adorn their State.
