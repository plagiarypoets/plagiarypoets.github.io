Blushing Love, whose Eyes blue languish,
Sweetly timid, swept the Lyre;
Wak'd the Soul to pleasing Anguish,
Thrilling Throbs, and quick Desire.
From the Chords his flutt'ring Fingers,
Swift responsive to his Wishes,
Call forth Transports, Raptures, Blisses.
In slow, sad Strains the Minstrel lingers,
The solemn Airs, in mellower Cadence charm,
And the long Sounds hang on the list'ning Ear.
The Passions feel his various Power;
Hope beckons, Pity's Eye renews
The Tear; Joy knows one cheerless Hour;
Despair takes Breath, and Hope pursues.
No more Fear trembles; Anger stands compos'd;
Fain would Revenge arrest his lifted Arm;
And, from her Pangs dear Melancholy rous'd,
The pensive Smile of Patience seems to wear.
