The Cupids had left all the Lawns,
The Shepherds fell out about Pan;
The Noise had affrighted the Fawns,
And all the kind Wood-doves were gone.

The Reeds had forgot their sweet Strains,
Nor murmur'd so soft as before;
Disputes had distracted the Swains,
And Love was regarded no more.

Poor Damon might talk to the Wind
His Passion for Nisa the Fair;
And think, and think on, till he pin'd;
And sigh till he vanish'd to Air.

The Shepherds sad Comforters prove;
Talk nought but of Pan, and the Times;
Inhumanly banter his Love,
And call it all Whining, and Rhimes.

To shun all their Jeers, and their Strife,
He flies to a neighbouring Cave,
To lament the hard Fate of his Life,
And hopes 'twill be shortly his Grave.

Against the damp Rock he reclin'd,
Like a languishing Lover, his Head:
"My Soul now unload thy whole Mind;
Here none can upbraid thee," he said.

He thought it a kind of Relief,
Whilst here he lamented alone;
Kind Echoes repeated his Grief,
In Plaints full as soft as his own.

"O!  all ye soft Powers above,
And must I be silent and die?
Did Nisa but know how I love,
The Charmer cou'd never deny.

"Young Colin had skill to complain,
And mingle such Art with his Woe;
The Nymphs were all touch'd with his Pain,
And Tears from the Nereids flow.

"But Damon, a plain-hearted Swain,
On mere simple Truth must rely:
But what can mere Truth hope to gain
In a Lover, so artless as I?

"What Oceans of Love through me roll!
Oh!  'tis not in Words to impart
The Billows, that hang on my Soul;
The Sorrow, that choaks up my Heart.

"Why, ye Fates, was I destin'd to bear
A Sorrow, I cannot reveal?
Or kill me, or help me declare
To Nisa the Passion I feel."

Young Colin stood listening near,
And thus he surprizes the Youth;
"If Nisa is human, she'll hear:
Ah!  Damon, no Language like Truth.

"Go tell her your own artless way;
Great Passions can ne'er be express'd:
Simplicity still wins the Day;
She knows how to guess at the rest.

"True love in a Soul, that's sincere,
Is better than Language, or Art:
Fine Similes tickle the Ear,
But Nature will soften the Heart."

"'Tis done &mdash; I have writ to my Fair;
But tremble to wait the Reply:
Ah!  Nisa, true Lovers are rare;
May Damon be happy, or die."
