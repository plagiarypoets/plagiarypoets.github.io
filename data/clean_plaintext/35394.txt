Under the arms of a goodly oak-tree,
There was of Swine a huge company,
They were making a rude repast,
Grunting as they crunched the mast.
Then they trotted away: for the wind grew high&mdash;
One acorn they left, ne more mote you spy.
Next came a Raven, who lik'd not such folly:
He belong'd, I believe, to the witch MELANCHOLY!
Blacker was he than blackest jet,
Flew low in the rain; his feathers were wet.
He pick'd up the acorn and buried it strait,
By the side of a river both deep and great.
Where then did the Raven go?
He went high and low&mdash;
O'er hill, o'er dale, did the black Raven go!
Many Autumns, many Springs
Travell'd he with wand'ring wings;
Many Summers, many Winters&mdash;
I can't tell half his adventures.
At length he return'd, and with him a she,
And the acorn was grown a large oak tree.
They built them a nest in the topmost bough,
And young ones they had, and were happy enow.
But soon came a Woodman in leathern guise:
His brow like a pent-house hung over his eyes.
He'd an axe in his hand, and he nothing spoke,
But with many a hem!  and a sturdy stroke,
At last he brought down the poor Raven's own oak.
His young ones were kill'd, for they could not depart,
And his wife she did die of a broken heart!
The boughs from off it the Woodman did sever;
And they floated it down on the course of the River;
They sawed it in planks, and its bark they did strip,
And with this tree and others they built up a ship.
The ship it was launch'd; but in sight of the land,
A temptest arose which no ship could withstand.
It bulg'd on a rock, and the waves rush'd in fast&mdash;
The auld Raven flew round and round, and caw'd to the blast.
He heard the sea-shriek of their perishing souls!
They be sunk!  O'er the top-mast the mad water rolls.
The Raven was glad that such fate they did meet&mdash;
They had taken his all, and REVENGE WAS SWEET!
