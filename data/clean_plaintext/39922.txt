'Twas as bright PHOEBUS, from the ocean rose,
And sighing Zephyrs sprang to kiss the boughs;
That ROGER, artless, as his numbers are,
Reclining, thus address'd his faithless fair,&mdash;
"O SUSAN!  canst thou so ungrateful prove?
And set at nought thy ROGER'S plighted love!
Canst thou forget what goodly fairings I,
Would bring thee home?  What pleasing ballads buy&mdash;
With minims set, and pins to deck thy hair?
Nor ever thought a village-lass so fair&mdash;
How canst thou, SUSAN, from thy vows depart?
Vows, whilst upon thy sheath I carv'd my heart;
The glass and spoon, you said, should disagree,
The much lov'd kettle lose it's use at tea;
Christmas should turn to Whitsuntide, and reel
The year about, &mdash; as doth thy fav'rite wheel,
E're thou would faithless prove, or change to be,
The pride, the joy, of any Swain but me.

"Now, ah!  ambitious of some wealthier spouse,
Thou disregard'st me, disregard'st thy vows."
