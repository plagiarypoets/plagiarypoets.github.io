When first thy beauty beam'd upon my soul,
Like morning darting on the misty deep,
Indifference, like a cloud, broke up, and stole
Away; and passions numberless from sleep
Awakening, o'er the trembling heart-strings sweep
Their fiery fingers, and my peace consume,
As some wild wassailers their revels keep,
While dumb Night nods without his sable plume,
Or whispers with pale Death, who piles their early tomb.

Little, ah!  little did I then surmise,
While all my heart had dreamt of loveliness
Played on thy cheek, that those enchanting eyes
Could shine undimm'd upon my soul's distress,
Because, perchance, my heaps of coin were less
Than others boasted who thy heart assail'd
And gain'd, despite the well-feign'd tenderness,
The ready syren tears, that never fail'd
To moisten our press'd cheeks when I at fortune rail'd.

But go thy way into the merry world,
And shine thy hour upon the painted scene,
Whence sorrow seems to nether darkness hurl'd,
While joy smiles in each face where she had been:
Yet aye remember that the laughing Queen
Of Love ne'er visits the brown vale of years,
Nor e'er has been to herd with wrinkles seen;
But, as the frosty head of age appears,
Turns back, and leaves life's thread to Grief's or Clotho's shears.

And when thou stand'st deserted in thy age,
On the last sands of ebbing life alone,
Try then thy fierce repentance to assuage,
By recollecting that the only one
Who lov'd thee for thyself, perchance, is gone
To join the cohorts of the grave for thee;
Or, if he live, fly to him, he will moan
Thy fate, when all have fled thee, and will be
Thy guide to that sad realm where all sleep silently.
