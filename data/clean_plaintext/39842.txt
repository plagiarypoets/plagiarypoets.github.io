Welcome great chieftain!  Freedom's boast,
To Freedom's sacred land;
Welcome to an admiring host
Whose grateful hearts expand
With joy to hail the warrior brave,
Whose arm was boldly stretch'd to save
Their country in her darkest hour,
When shrinking from the oppressor's power,
She mourned the ruthless fate which seemed to say,
"Thy freedom soon expires, crush'd in its natal day."

Thy heart was gallant, young and warm,
Thy sword was prompt and true;
And midst the battle's loud alarm,
Thy conq'ring banners flew.
'Twas freedom's cause thy soul inspir'd,
'Twas holy zeal thy bosom fir'd,
When strong thy generous wrath arose,
And rush'd with ruin on our foes.
How bright the glory then thy valour won,
A nation's gratitude, the love of Washington!

That sacred name, what thoughts of pride
Does it not yield to thee,
Whene'er thou think'st how side by side
Ye won our liberty?
For us, we never shall forget
To whom we owe that mighty debt!
And join'd with his immortal name,
Thine, living on the rolls of fame,
Through every age, admired and lov'd shall flow,
And teach each generous heart with patriot warmth to glow.

Then welcome to the honours now
Our grateful hearts prepare;
The wreath to decorate thy brow
Is braided by the fair;
And bards have waked each tuneful shell,
To bid the songs of triumph swell;
Ten thousand thousand hearts beat high,
Throughout this land of liberty,
To tell the list'ning world with loud acclaim,
The glory that is due to Fayette's honour'd name.
