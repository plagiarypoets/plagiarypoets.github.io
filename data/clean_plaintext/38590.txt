Fret not thy self, thou man of modern song,
That thou'rt confin'd, and eke thy cheek is sore;
Nor pining say, the Fates have done thee wrong;
Mischance like this has hap'd to bards of yore,
And shall to future bards, till time shall be no more!
Behold thy Ann (of all that's good the best)
Of virgin charms displaying matchless store,
Pillows thy head upon her snow-white breast,
And looks of love shall lull thy sorrowing soul to rest!
