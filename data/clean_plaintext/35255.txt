Still from dark nook shall bat-wing'd Scandal fly,
Rise and renew, though oft smote-down, her shriek,
Harsh in our ears repeat her one shrill cry,
Tho' false, still urg'd, and mischievous, tho' weak?
You tell me only Christians persecute,
But, taught in Candour's school, corrected say,
The Christian never acts the murd'rous brute,
Till from his shepherd's fold he runs astray;
Then grows he savage-fierce to rend and tear,
But, spite of red-cross mark, no lamb of Christ is there.
