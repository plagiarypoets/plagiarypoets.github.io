ZARA'S EVENING PRAYER.
Father of all! &mdash; of life and boundless love!
Omnipotent, omniscient Lord of Heaven!
Who sittest enthroned 'midst cherubim above!
To Thee all glory, prayer, and praise be given.&mdash;
Witness if I be silent morn or even,
Ye hills, ye vales, and ever-rolling sea,
Whose ambient floods around the world are driven.&mdash;
O, Lord!  how good is every thing from Thee!
To utter all thy praise falls short &mdash; Eternity.

Most blessed Jesus! &mdash; glory of the world!&mdash;
The Lamb of God! &mdash; the Saviour of mankind!&mdash;
Whose holy life to mortals hath unfurl'd
A page, where all the laws of Heaven we find.&mdash;
Light of creation!  sunshine of the blind!
Oh!  may Thy name for ever hallow'd be;
Warm every heart, enlighten every mind.&mdash;
Lord, from Thy presence whither shall I flee?
In earth and Heaven above all glory be to Thee!

Then bless the Lord, my soul; O bless the Lord!
Almighty Father!  on my bended knees
I call upon Thy hallow'd name adored!
Join every living thing, ye rolling seas,&mdash;
Ye woods, ye waves, ye spirits of the breeze,
And thou that tread'st th' ethereal fields above,&mdash;
Star of the day!  whose last beams yon tall trees
Have tipp'd with living  gold, high o'er the grove,&mdash;
O praise th' Eternal God, &mdash; the Lord of life and love!

Ye harmless birds, that tune your happy lays,
And innocently open your glad wings,
Rock'd by the breath of Heaven upon the sprays,
Where every blossom which is lovely springs,&mdash;
O tune each little throat that sweetly sings
To your great Maker! &mdash; every note be laud!&mdash;
Who built yon arch, where Night her spangles flings?&mdash;
Who reared the mounts? &mdash; who spread the seas abroad?&mdash;
Earth &mdash; ocean &mdash; echoes &mdash; lightnings &mdash; thunders &mdash; thunder, "God!"

"Hail, Source of Being!  Universal Soul
Of Heaven and earth!  Essential Presence, hail!"
Lord of the endless Heavens, and worlds which roll
Beyond the bounds of mortal fancy frail!
O Thou, who ridest upon the stormy gale,
Upholding all the star-bespangled steep!
To Thee I bend the knee!  my lips do fail
To utter praises! &mdash; Ah!  I can but weep!&mdash;
Lord, read my heart; Thou know'st its inward feelings deep.
