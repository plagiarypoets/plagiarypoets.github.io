"There is a living spirit in the lyre"&mdash;
'Tis true; but if a hand unskill'd should dare
To wake its chords without the genuine fire,
The inspiration which but few can share,
Would that soul-thrilling harmony be there?
That wild, ecstatic, overwhelming madness,
Which lifts the mind beyond each earthly care,
And turns its thoughts of anguish into gladness,
Or leaves, at least, behind a mild and pleasing sadness?

It could not be; the vain attempt would bring
Derision on the self-confiding wight,
Who dar'd to strike the muse's hallow'd string,
Nor knew to guide its symphonies aright:
Yet such, methinks, am I; my upward flight
Is clogg'd and stay'd by gross terrestrial things;
And if, by chance, a beam of heavenly light
Should break upon my spirit's wanderings,
How fleeting is the joy its transient radiance brings.

I fain would soar above this lower sphere,
And, eagle-like, mount upward to the skies:
My ardent soul disdains to linger here,
And with those master spirits longs to rise,
Who sought and won the invaluable prize,
The meed of never-dying, endless fame:
Though dead to earth their memory never dies,
It is a spark of an immortal flame,
Quenchless as is the source from whence at first it came.

'Tis pleasant in the sleepless dreams of thought,
To let imagination rove at will&mdash;
Through many a future year with pleasure fraught;
But in our sober moments comes a thrill,
Which tells us that they are but visions still:
So 'tis with all my aspirations high;
Though, for awhile, they may my bosom fill
With hopes of fame, at reason's touch they fly,&mdash;
As when the sun appears the darkness passeth by.

Yet will I not forsake the flowery ways
Of poesy, which I have trod so long;
Though mine may be but rude, unpolish'd lays,
I cannot live without the light of song;
Its beams have oft dispell'd the dreary throng,
Of dark despairing thoughts which haunt my breast:
Then who can blame me that I would prolong
The dear delusion which has brought me rest,
When I might else have sunk by care and grief oppress'd?

Surely, my gentle friend, thou wilt not be
A rigid judge, though such a strain as mine
Is far beneath thy glowing minstrelsy;
Poetic bays I willingly resign;
But as a dimly-twinkling star may shine
Amid surrounding gloom, my humble lays
May faintly glow till swallow'd up by thine,&mdash;
And, lost amid their bright, unclouded blaze,
They cease to shed around their dim and feeble rays.
