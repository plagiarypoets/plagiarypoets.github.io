TIME &mdash; EVENING.
Goddess of Nature!  source of ev'ry joy
That nobly agitates the frame of man,
But not of those that flatter and destroy,
Accept the song that from thyself began!
At Russel's tomb unceasingly I mourn,
And pour to thee that hymn that echoes from his urn!

Thy hands, perhaps, in some romantic dell,
Where Nature reigns, all beautifully wild;
Beneath the craggy mountain's awful swell,
A pious trophy to his name have pil'd:
Where oft, when sails the breezy morn along,
Thou join'st the warbling woods in harmony of song.

And where, again, at Evening's solemn hour,
What time the Moon her silver chariot rears,
While Philomela, from her lonely bow'r,
Pours the sad notes that call the willing tears,
Thou lov'st upon the  closing flowrs to lay thy head,
Rapt in sweet dreams of him for whom those tears are shed.

Oh!  leave thy woods!  nor, at my pray'r, refuse
To tread with me a more than midnight gloom;
And, as the worm his silent work pursued,
We'll pause to view the triumphs of the tomb,
Where Death's stern king in sullen horrors reigns,
Breathing black starless night o'er Russel's lov'd remains.

Fear not to come! &mdash; oh!  turn not thus away!
No polish'd fiend allures thee to his arms,
With democratic voice to urge thy stay,
And teach the crowd to idolize thy charms;
The while his minions, as they play around,
Securely fix their chains, and drag thee to the ground.

Here sleeps thy son &mdash; thy great, thy glorious son,
Who, taught by thee, the paths of virtue trod:
He won the prize before his race was run,
And left his country to behold his God:
And where thy Russel sleeps, Vice dares not come,
But hides her blushing face, and rushes by his tomb.
