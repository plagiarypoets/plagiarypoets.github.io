Awake once more my Lyre!  thou who hast been
On woody upland and o'er grassy lea,
Thro' many a calm and many a stormy scene
The sharer of my feelings &mdash; and shalt be!
Thou who hast been what few have been to me,
Ne'er with a deeper feeling of delight
Did I awake thy earlier minstrelsy,
When but the wood-nymphs heard thy numbers' flight
Winging its artless way thro' the blue-starry night&mdash;

Yes, never did this hand awake thy string
With deeper rapture than it now awakes,
Tho' the wild song which thou wert wont to sing
Must be forgot, and tho' thy soul forsakes
The luxury of green groves and glassy lakes,
To woo the unsparing world's fastidious ear,
Yet need'st thou not lament thy bow'rs and brakes,
Thy distant waterfalls and currents clear,
And oft the approving voice of listening mountaineer;&mdash;

For there is one, thy country's friend and thine,
But for whose patron-voice thou shouldst not go
Forth from thy haunts of rose and eglantine;&mdash;
Who will not know thee when he deigns to know,
"Good without effort &mdash; great without a foe?"
And tho' thou'rt stranger to the force and fire
Of other chords, thou must not tremble, &mdash; no!&mdash;
Were but his ear to hear, whom all admire,
Great were thy minstrel's meed: &mdash; then wake once more my lyre!
