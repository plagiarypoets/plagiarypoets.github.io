Loveliest and best belov'd, sever'd from thee
How oft the lagging hours I sorely chide;
And murmur "when, O when, shall I see
&mdash;"My sweet Ianthe, mine and Beauty's pride?"
At opening morn I wish for even-tide;
When evening comes, "return, O morn, I cry!"
And still I think, though from afar descried,
Could I but see thy home I less should sigh:
For I might fancy that may straining eye
Saw thee fond musing on thine absent love.
Oft, too, I say, sad gazing on the sky,
"O were but mine the pinions of the dove,
How soon, Ianthe, should thy soothing strains
In sweet oblivion lull my cares and pains!"
