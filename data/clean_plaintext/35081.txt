Not he, O Muse!  whom the auspicious eyes
Kind in his primeval hour beheld,
Shall victor in the Isthmian contest rise;
Nor o'er the long-resounding field
The rapid horse his kindling wheels shall roll,
Gay in th' Olympic race, and foremost at the goal.

Nor in the Capitol, triumphant shown,
The victor laurel on his brow,
For the proud threats of vaunting kings o'erthrown;
But Tiber's streams, that warbling flow,
And groves of fragrant gloom, resound his strains,
Whose sweet Aeolian grace high celebration gains.

Now that his name, her noblest bards among,
Th' imperial city loudly hails,
That proud distinction guards his rising song,
When Envy's carping tongue assails;
In sullen silence now she hears his praise,
Nor shed her canker'd spots upon his springing bays.

O Muse!  who rulest every dulcet lay
That floats along the gilded shell;
That the mute tenant of the watery way
Canst teach, at pleasure, to excel
The softest notes harmonious sorrow brings,
When the expiring swan her own sad requiem sings.

Thine be the praise, that pointing Romans guide
The stranger's eye, with proud desire,
That well he note the man, whom crowds decide
Should boldly string the Latian lyre.&mdash;
Ah!  when I please, if still to please be mine,
Nymph of th' Aeolian shell, be all the glory THINE.
