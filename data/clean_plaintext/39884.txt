MADNESS.
With hundred iron chains he did him bind,
An hundred knots that did him sore constrain;
Yet his great iron teeth he still did grind,
And grimly gnash, threat'ning revenge in vain;
His burning eye, which bloody streaks did stain,
Stared full wide, and shot forth sparks of fire;
And more for rank despite, than for great pain,
Shook his long locks, color'd like copper wire,
And bit his tawny beard, to shew his raging ire!


GUYON CONDUCTED BY MAMMON THROUGH A SUBTERRANEAN CAVERN TO SEE HIS TREASURE.
At length they came into a larger space,
That stretch'd itself into an ample plain,
Through which a beaten broad highway did trace,
That straight did lead to Pluto's gloomy reign;
By that way-side there sat infernal Pain,
And fast beside him sat tumultuous Strife;
The one in hand an iron whip did strain,
The other brandished a bloody knife,
And both did gnash their teeth, and both did threaten life.

On the other side in one consort there sate
Cruel Revenge, and rancorous Despite,
Disloyal Treason, and heart-burning Hate;
But gnawing Jealousy, out of their sight
Sitting alone, his bitter lips did bite:
And trembling Fear still to and fro did fly,
And found no place where safe he shroud him might.
Lamenting Sorrow did in darkness lie,
And Shame his ugly face did hide from living eye.

And over them sad Horror, with grim hue
Did always soar, beating his iron wings;
And after him owls and night ravens flew,
The hateful messengers of heavy things,
Of death and dolor telling sad tidings;
Whilst sad Celeno, sitting on a cliff,
A song of bale and bitter sorrows sings,
That heart of flint asunder would have rift;
Which having ended, after him she flieth swift.
