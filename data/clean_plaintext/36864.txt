Man's chained to being, though he never sought
That spark of immortality within&mdash;
That immaterial essence, that is brought
To waken dust, then must of course begin
To run a round of wickedness and sin.
And I unsought-for life must drag along,
Though sternly I deny myself akin
To aught like flesh; I never herd among
That race so dead to feeling &mdash; that degraded throng.

Although I have the semblance of a man&mdash;
Although I wear the aspect of the race&mdash;
Although I live and breathe, I never can
Be brought to own in them a kindred face,
Whose hearts are stamped with folly and disgrace.
No!  here I'll unnoticed, and alone
On this blank spot, where I can Nature trace&mdash;
The snow-wrapt mountain is a happier zone
Than man's remorseless breast where pity is unknown.

For I have been amongst them &mdash; I have seen
More than enough for curiosity.
The Treachery sits upon a brow serene,
And Hatred spits her venom when you see
Nought but the smiles of peace and amity,
I've seen how cold neglect and scorn is felt
By honest worth when link'd to poverty,
While crouching parasites in thousands knelt
To where Dame Fortune had her goodliest bounties dealt.

In youth I did possess a friend; but he,
When went my house and fortune to decay,
Left me to struggle with my misery.
Nor he alone, but thousands more who stay
While in prosperity, then fled away,
And I was friendless!  and a thousand woes
Surrounded me, and I became the prey
Of my own feelings; but I found repose,
And here I'll rest till life's protracted journey close.
