Madame, I should have feared that this crosse
Would have disturb'd your patience, and the losse
Of such a noble father, such a brother,
Coming upon the neck of one another,
Would have disorder'd you, but that I knew
Your godly breast prepared well enough
With antidotes of grace against such haps
As Divine providence casts in our laps.
The early Mattens which you daily said,
And Vespers, when you dwelt next doore saint Chad,
And home-devotion when the closet doore
Was shut, did me this augurie afford,
That when such blustring storms as these should start
They should not break the calmnesse of your heart.
With joy I recollect and think upon
Your reverent Church-like devotion;
Who by your fair example did excite
Church-men and clerks to do their duty right,
And by frequenting that most sacred quire,
Taught many how to heav'n they should aspire.
For our Cathedralls to a beamlesse eye
Are quires of angels in epitomie,
Maugre the blatant beast, who cries them down
As favouring of superstition.
Misguided people!  But for your sweet self,
Madame, you never dash'd against that shelf
Of stubbornnesse against the Church; but you
(Pauls virgin and saint Peters matrone too)
Though I confesse you did most rarely paint,
Yet were no hypocrite, but a true saint:
Nature hath given you beauty of the skin,
And grace hath made you beautifull within,
Like a Kings daughter; Nature, Grace and Name,
Concurring all to raise your vertuous fame:
Which may you long enjoy below, till Jove
Call you to your bless'd Pedegree above.

My verse and tears would gladly sympathize,
And be both without number; but my eyes
Are the best Poet, for they shed great store
Of elegies, when I have not one verse more.
