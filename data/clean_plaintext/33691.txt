Judicious Spencer shakes his Reverend Head,
Depress'd when living, slighted now he's dead:
Passionate Tasso doth almost Blaspheme,
To see aspers'd his great Jerusalem:
The Colour's lively and the Flesh is sound,
'Tis Gold Embroidery on a Purple Ground:
Marini can't be angry, but doth smile,
His Humour is as charming as his Stile:
A Table richly spread you there enjoy;
Tho' all desert the Dainties do not cloy:
The least resenting he provoketh most,
'Tis the Ingenious, Candid Cowley's Ghost:
He did complain of Fame's inconstant Breath,
And he is robb'd of that too after Death. . . .
