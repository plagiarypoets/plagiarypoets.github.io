LELIA.
What sorrow seiseth on my heavy heart?
Consuming care posseseth everie part:
Heart-sad Erinnis keeps his mansion Here,
Within the Closure of my wofull breast;
And black despaire with Iron Scepter stands,
And guides my thoughts, down to his hateful Cell.
The wanton windes with whistling murmur beare
My pearcing plaints along the desert plaines,
And woodes and groves do eccho forth my woes,
The earth below relents in Crystall teares,
When heavens above by some malignant course
Of fatall starres are authors of my griefe.
Fond Love, go hide thy shafts in Follies den,
And let the world forget thy Childish force,
Or else flye, flye, pearce Sophos tender breast,
That he may helpe to symphthize these plaints
That wring these teares from Lelias weeping eyes.
