Far off remov'd from ev'ry harsher noise,
Here let my busy thoughts in silence rove,
Repeat the fleeting scenes of former joys,
And the soft anguish of a faithful love:
With just resemblance bless the gen'rous fair,
Renew my trembling hopes and ev'ry softer care.

But ah!  unequal to the vast design,
What daring numbers shall attempt thy praise,
Unrival'd mind!  or sing a love like mine,
Immortal passion, in immortal lays.
Thy ev'ry charm, or my too tender heart,
No sacred power of words no numbers can impart.

Form'd but to please, with ev'ry grace combin'd,
From beauty's charms, o'er ev'ry heart you reign,
But still the greater beauties of your mind,
Your wit and virtue form a nobler chain;
Hail heav'nly maid; for all must think thee so,
Since to be fair and good, is all of hea'n we know.&mdash;

Ah, cruel fates, regardless of my care,
How could you rend her from my bleeding breast?
Stab smiling joy, and plunge me in despair,
With all the weight of love and woe oppress'd?
Yet still my soul the blooming form retains,
And there, in absence spite, the lov'd idea reigns.

While the kind charmer bless'd my ravish'd view,
Extatic bliss would ev'ry thought employ,
On silken wings the silent moments flew,
Time was not known, but all was love and joy.
How chang'd the scene!  desponding droops my soul,
And clogg'd with leaden grief the ling'ring moments roll!

When warm'd in virtue's cause, the lovely maid
With sweetest skill, would all its charms display,
Swift from my breast, the guilty passions fled,
And new-born peace confess'd its gentler sway,
Virtue from her had truths before unknown,
Resum'd her antient seat, and with fresh vigour shone.

But see, far shooting thro' the dusky gloom
Of dark futurity, a kindly ray
Points out the happiness of years to come,
Th' unclouded prospects of a brighter day,
When in my fair, of all, of heav'n possess'd,
Joys, constant, great as theirs, shall fire my raptur'd breast.
