Ah!  doubt not, my Delia, thy Damon's return,
Tho' fate thus commands us to part,
In my breast the soft passion for ever shall burn,
And thy image still twine round my heart.

The remembrance of scenes, so late my delight,
And the haunts where we used to rove,
The cloud topping hill, or the dale blooming bright,
Or the cooling recess of the grove.

These, these shall my memory ever retain,
And its joys in fair numbers rehearse,
My muse shall assist the glad task of my pen,
And gratitude swell the sad verse.

Tho' lost to my sight, still the same is my love,
Which no period of time can erase;
Neither absence, nor time, can my passion remove,
Nor aught my affections efface.
