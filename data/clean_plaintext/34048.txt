Of feathred Foules, that fanne the bucksom Aire,
Not All alike weare made for Foode to Men;
For, These Thou shalt not eat, doth God declare,
Twice tenne Their Nombre, and their Fleshe unclene:
Fyrst the Great Eagle, Byrde of feigned Jove,
Which Thebanes worshippe, and Diviners love:

Next Ossisrage, and Ospray, (Both One kinde)
Of Luxurie, and Rapine, Emblems mete,
That haunte the Shores, the choicest Preye to finde,
And brast the Bones, and scoope the Marrow swete:
The Vulture, void of Delicace, and Feare,
Who spareth not the pale dede Man to tear:

The tall-built Swann, faire Type of Pride confesst;
The Pelicane, whose Sons are nurst with Bloode,
Forbid to Man! &mdash; She stabbeth deep hir Breast,
Self Murtheresse through Fondness to hir Broode:
They too that raunge the thirstie Wildes emong,
The Ostryches, unthoughtful of thir Yonge:

The Raven ominous, (As Gentiles holde)
What Time She croaketh hoarsely A la Morte;
The Hawke, Aerial Hunter, swift, and bolde,
In Feates of Mischief trayned for Disporte;
The vocale Cuckowe, of the Faulcon Race,
Obscene Intruder in hir Neighbor's Place:

The Owle demure, who loveth not the Lighte,
(Ill Semblance She of Wisdome to the Greeke)
The smallest Fouls dradd Foe, the Coward Kite,
And the still Herne, arresting Fishes meeke;
The glutton Cormorante, of sullen Moode:
Regardying no Distinction in hir Foode.

The Storke, whiche dwelleth on the Fir tree-topp,
And trusteth that no Pow'er shall Hir dismaye,
As Kinges on thir high Stations place thir Hope,
Nor wist that there be higher farr than Theye:
The gay Gier-Eagle, beautifull to viewe,
Bearyng within a Savage Herte untrewe:

The Ibis whome in Egypte Israel found,
Fell Byrd!  That livying Serpents con digest;
The crested Lapwynge, wailing shrille Arounde,
Sollicitious, with noe Contentment blest:
Last the foul Batt, of Byrde, and Beast fyrst bredde,
Flittyng, with littel leathren Sailes dispredde.
