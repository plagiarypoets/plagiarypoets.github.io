Ye polish'd arts, that o'er the human mind
Too often triumph with seductive sway,
From this lone solitude the pangs unkind
Of rude and restless sorrow chace away.
From heaven ye sprung, from heaven's eternal ray,
And heavenly the commission that ye bear;
Here then your angel-offices display,
And sooth each bitter thought, each wild and busy care.

Oh!  turn from them, the idle and the vain,
From them, the base, the selfish, and the proud;
Your gentler recompence and nobler gain
Not the applauding tumult of the crowd,
But oh!  to scatter the tempestuous cloud
Of mortal griefs, to blunt affection's dart,
And, sweetly, from the cradle to the shroud,
Soften's life's rugged doom, and meliorate the heart.

Visit, ye Muses!  with celestial aid
This humble spot, and lighten my sad hours;
For well ye love the silence of the shade,
And pleasant woods where leafy grandeur lours;
And here are groves, and fields, and fragrant flowers,
And bubbling brooks that gently murmur near&mdash;
Oh!  live for ever in these happy bowers,
And shed your purest joys, your holiest blessings here!
