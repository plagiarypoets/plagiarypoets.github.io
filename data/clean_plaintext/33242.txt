THE ARGUMENT.
Dorycles loves Bellina;
Who esteemes
As well of him,
But proves not same she seemes.

THE SECOND ARGUMENT.
Dorycles a youthfull Swaine,
Seekes Bellina's love to gaine:
Who, so even doth fancy strike,
Tenders Dorycles the like.
Yet observe how women be
Subject to inconstancie!
Shee in absence of her love,
Her affection doth remove,
Planting it upon a Swad,
That no wit nor breeding had.
Whom she honours; but in time
Dorycles seemes to divine,
Since her love is stain'd with sin,
She'le ere long dishonour him;
For who once hath broke her vow,
Will infringe't to others too.
In the end he doth expresse
His disdainfull Shepherdesse:
Who, when she had injured
Him and his, and cancelled
That same sacred secret oath,
Firmely tendred by them both;
She a Willow-garland sends
For to make her Swaine amends,
Which he weares, and vowes till death
He will weare that forlorne wreath.
With protests of lesse delight
In her Love, than in her Spight.

Come Shepherds come, and heare the wofulst Swaine
That ever liv'd, or lov'd on western plaine.
Whose heavy fate all others doth surpasse
That ere you heard;

DYMNUS.
Say Heardsman what it was.

DORYCLES.
I must and will, though Dymnus I confesse,
I'm very loth my folly to expresse,
Whole madding passion though it merit blame,
I will display't.

TECHNIS.
To't then:  away with shame.

DORYCLES.
I lov'd a bonny Lasse as ere lov'd man,
For she a middle had that you might span,
A moving eye, a nimble mincing foot,
And mannerly she was, for she could lout:
And her I lov'd, and me she held as deare.

CORYDON.
But Dorycles where liv'd she?

DORYCLES.
Very neare:
Knowst thou not Polychrestus?

CORYDON.
Who, the Swaine
That with his sheepe doth cover all our Plaine?

DORYCLES.
It seemes thou knowst him Coridon;

CORYDON.
I doe:
And seven yeeres since I knew his Daughter too.

DORYCLES.
Who, faire Bellina?

CORYDON.
Yes, the very same.

DORYCLES.
And her I lov'd, nor need I thinke't a shame.
For what might move affection or imply
Content of love to any Shepheards eye,
Which she enjoy'd not?  For if choyce discourse
(As what more moving than the tongue) had force
To infuse love, there was no Heardsman neere her
Who was not ravish'd if he chanc'd to heare her;
And for a beauty mix'd with white and red.

CORYDON.
I know't was rare, good Dorycles proceed.

DORYCLES.
When I was young, as yet I am not old,
I doted more than now a hundred fold:
For there was not a May-game that could show it
All here about, but I repaird unto it,
Yet knew not what love meant, but was content
To spend the time in harmlesse merriment.
But at the last, I plaid so long with fire,
I cing'd my wings with heat of loves desire.
And to display my folly how it was
Without digression, thus it came to passe.
Downe by yon Vale a Myrtle grove there is,
(Oh that I nere had seene it, I may wish)
Where Pan the Shepheards God to whom we pray,
Solemniz'd had his wonted holiday:
Whereto resorted many noble Swaines,
Who flourish yet upon our neighbour Plaines;
'Mongst which Bellina with a youthfull sort
Of amorous Nimphs, came to survey our sport.
Which I observing (see the fault of youth)
Transported with vain-glory, thought in truth
Shee came a purpose for a sight of me,
Which I with similes requited lovingly:
But howsoere, I know Bellina ey'de
My person more than all the swaines beside.
When night was come, unwelcome unto some,
And each was now to hasten towards home,
I 'mongst the rest of Laddes, did homeward passe,
And all this time I knew not what Love was.
To supper went I and fell to my fare,
As if of love I had but little care,
And after supper went to fire to chat
Of sundry old-wives tales, as this and that;
Yet all this while love had no power of me,
Nor no command that ever I could see.
Having thus spent in tales an houre or two,
Each to his rest (as he thought best) did goe,
But now when I should take me to my rest,
That troubled me which I did thinke of least.

TECHNIS.
Trouble thee Swaine!

DORYCLES.
Yes Technis; and the more,
Because I never felt such pangs before.
This way and that way did I tosse and turne,
And freeze and frie, and shake for cold and burne,
So as I wisht a hundred times, that day
Would now approach my passion to allay.
Yet still, (so weake was my distemper'd braine)
I thought Bellina put me to that paine,
Yet knew no cause why shee should use me so,
Yet thought to aske her if't were shee or no:
So as next day, I purpos'd to repaire
To see if shee could yeeld a cure to care.
But she (poore wench) was split on fancies shelfe,
All full of care, yet could not cure herselfe;
So as in briefe we either did impart,
She secret passions of a wounded heart,
Shot by loves shaft, for so't appear'd to be,
Which found, we vow'd a present remedie;
Yet to our friends both shee and I did feane,
As if we never had acquainted beene.

DYMNUS.
A prety sleight;

DORYCLES.
Though many times and oft,
Plaid we at Barlybreake in Clytus croft.
And thus our loves continued one halfe yeere
Without suspitton, till one neighboring neere,
An equall friend unto us both, did make
A motion of our Mariage.

TECHNIS.
Did it take?

DORYCLES.
Yes Technis yes, so as first day I went,
My friends, to shew that they were well content,
Wish'd that all good successe might usher mee.

LINUS.
One should have throwne an old shoo after thee.

DORYCLES.
Nay Linus that was done:  and now to hie
Unto my Tale, on went my dogge and I,
Poore loave-eard Curre.

SAPPHUS.
Why Dorycles, hadst none
To second thee?

DORYCLES.
Too many (Swaine) by one:
For trowst thou Lad, when I my suit should make
Unto her friends, my dogge he let a scape.

SAPPHUS.
Ill nurtur'd stitchell.

DORYCLES.
Now yee may suppose
Bellina tooke the Pepper in the nose,
That to her friends when I should breake my minde,
The carrian Cur should at that time breake winde.
So as for halfe an houre I there did show
Like to a senslesse Picture made of dough:
Nor was my dogge lesse 'sham'd, but runs away
With taile betwixt his legs with speed he may.
At last my spirits I did call together,
Showing her friends the cause why I came thither,
Who did accept my motion; for that day
I was esteem'd a proper Swaine I say,
And one well left

CORYDON.
We know it Dorycles,
Both for thy wealth and person thou mightst please.

LINUS.
For good mug-sheepe and cattell, Ile be sworne
None could come neare thee both for haire and horne.

DORYCLES.
Yee over-value me, but sure I am
I had sufficient for an honest man:
Having thus free accesse to her I lov'd,
Who my affection long before had prov'd
Though she seemd nice, as women often use,
When what they love they seemingly refuse.
Not to insist ought longer on the matter,
They deemd me worthy, if they did not flatter,
Of her I su'd; So as without more stay,
Appointed was this solemne Nuptiall day.

SAPPHUS.
Happy appointment;

DORYCLES.
Sapphus say not so,
It rather was the subject of my woe,
For having heard reported for a truth
She formerly had lov'd a dapper youth,
With whom she purpos'd even in friends despight,
To make a private scape one winter night;
If or a while thought to surcease my suit,
Till I heard further of this jealous bruit.

TECHNIS.
Why didst thou so?  Bellina had consented
To love that youth, before you were acquainted.

DORYCLES.
Technis tis true; But some there were aver'd,
Though I'm resolv'd they in opinion err'd,
That these two were affide one to the other.

SAPPHUS.
What hindred then the match?

DORYCLES.
Bellinas mother:
Who tender of th' advancement of her childe,
And well perceiving Crispus to be wilde,
(For so the youth was named) did withdraw
Bellina from him by imperious awe:
Which done, and he prevented of her daughter,
His Countrey left, he never sought her after.

TECHNIS.
I knew that Crispus.

DORYCLES.
Then you knew a lad
Of seeming presence, but he little had,
And that was cause he grew in disesteeme.

SAPPHUS.
Alas that want of meanes should make us meane.

DORYCLES.
So did it fare with him; for to his praise
(Though with his tongue he wrong'd me many waies,
But tongues inur'd to tales are nere beleev'd)
He had from Nature choicest gifts receiv'd,
Which might have mov'd love in a worthy creature,
If that his life had beene unto his feature.
But promising out-sides like the Panthers skin,
Though faire without, are oft times foule within;
But heavens, I hope, to mercy will receive him,
His wrongs to me are buried; so I leave him.

CORYDON.
But admit Shepheard they had beene affide,
Shee might revolt, it cannot be denide.

DORYCLES.
I grant she might; and I confesse there be
Some that have done't are greater farre than we:
But goodnesse is the marke, not height of state
That meaner men by right should imitate.
I might produce store of examples here,
But lest I should be tedious, I forbeare,
What tragick Scenes from breach of faith are bred,
How it hath caus'd much guiltlesse bloud be shed.
This caus'd me for a time to hold my hand,
To see how all this businesse would stand,
And that I might my fancie better waine
From her I lov'd, to Troynovant I came.
Where I imploi'd my selfe no little time
About occasions for a friend of mine:
For I did thinke to be from place remov'd,
Would make me soone forget the wench I lov'd.

SAPPHUS.
I rather thinke it would thy love renew;

DORYCLES.
Sapphus it did; and farre more rigour shew:
"For true it is, when lovers goe to wooe,
Each mile's as long as ten, each houre as two.
Whence each true lover by experience proves
Man is not where he lives, but where he loves."
For what delight, as all delights were there,
Could my enthralled minde refresh or cheere,
Wanting my Love, whose only sight could show
More true content than all the world could doe?
Yet stay'd I still, expecting I should heare,
How in my absence, she herselfe did beare,
And whether those same rumours which I heard,
Were true or false, as I found afterward.

LINUS.
How went they Dorycles?

DORYCLES.
Howso ere they went
I found Bellina meerely innocent;
Whence I inferr'd, that many times we wrong them,
By causelesse laying false aspersions on them:
For I perceiv'd she had beene woo'd by many,
But never yet affianc'd unto any.

CORYDON.
Thrice happie Dorycles!

DORYCLES.
Happie indeed,
Till worse events did afterwards succeed.

CORYDON.
What fate?

DORYCLES.
Farre worse than ere on Shepheard leight.

TECHNIS.
Expresse it Heardsman;

DORYCLES.
So I purpose streight.
Having thus heard all rumours to be vaine,
I streight resolv'd to returne backe againe
Into my Countrey:  where I found my wench
The same I left her when I came from thence,
So as in briefe, so happie was my state,
I meant my marriage rites to consummate.
Which that they might be done more solemnly,
All our young Shepheards in a company,
Address'd themselves to grace that day; beside
The choicest Damsels to attend the Bride,
For to prevent occasion of delay,
Set downe on both sides was the Mariage day.

TECHNIS.
Me thinkes this cannot chuse but happen well;

DORYCLES.
Stay Technis heare, what afterwards befell!
The Even before that I should maried be,
One came in all haste and acquainted me
How Cacus that uncivill lossell, would
Carry the best Ram that I had to fold;
Wherewith incens'd withouten further stay,
Going to th' fold I met him in the way:
Who of my Ram not onely me denide,
But us'd me in disgracefull sort beside,
Which I distasting, without more adoe
Reach'd my unnurtur'd Cacus such a blow,
As he in heat of passion aymd his Crooke
Just at my head to wound me with the stroake:
Which I rewarded, so as by our men
Without more hurt we both were parted then.
But scarce had Pheebus lodged in the West,
Till He, whose fury would not let him rest,
Sent me a challenge stuffed with disgrace,
Length of his Weapon, Second, and the Place.

DYMNUS.
Then we must have a field fought.

DORYCLES.
Without stay;
I met him though it was my mariage day,
Though not on equall termes.

TECHNIS.
More fit't had bin
T' encounter'd with Bellina than with him.

SAPPHUS.
I would have thought so Technis;
LINUS.
So would hee,
If he had beene resolv'd as he should be.

DORYCLES.
Shepheards tis true; but now it is too late,
For to exclaime against relentless fate,
Whose adverse hand prevented that delight,
Which lovers reape in a blest nuptiall night.

CORYDON.
Thou mightst with credit have deferr'd it, Swaine;

DORYCLES.
I know it, Corydon:  but twas my aime
To right my reputation, which did stand
Engag'd, unlesse I met him out a hand,
Which I perform'd, and with my Second too,
To beare me witnesse what I meant to doe.

DYMNUS.
And he perform'd the like;

DORYCLES.
He vow'd he would,
And so indeed by Law of armes he should,
But I perceiv'd his recreant spirit such,
To fight on equall termes he thought too much:
Neere to Soranus cave there stands a grove,
Which Poets faine was consecrate to Jove,
Though then it seem'd to be transform'd by fate,
From th' grove of Love, unto the grave of Hate;
There we did meet:  where he out of distrust,
Fearing the cause he fought for was not just,
To second his injurious act, did bring
A rout of desperate rogues along with him,
Who lurking, kept together till we met,
And so upon advantage me beset,
As fight or fall, there was no remedie,
Such was the height of Cacus villanie.

TECHNIS.
Who ever heard a more perfidious tricke?

DORYCLES.
Tis true; yet though my Second had been sicke,
And much enfeebled in his formers strength,
We held them play, till haplesly at length,
Through violence of fury, from him fell
His lucklesse weapon.

DYMNUS.
Oh I heare thee tell
A heavy Scene!

DORYCLES.
Yes Dymnus hadst thou seene
How our shed bloud purpled the flowrie greene,
What crimson streamlins flow'd from either of us,
Thou wouldst have pitied, though thou nere did love us:
For having fought so long as we had breath,
Breathlesse we lay as Images of death,
Bereft of sense or Motion.

SAPPHUS.
'Las for woe,
Any true Heardsman should be used so.

CORYDON.
What boundlesse sorrowes were ye plunged in!

DORYCLES.
Tis true; and worser farre had used bin,
Had not Dametas that well natur'd Swaine,
Repair'd that instant to our forlorne Plaine;
Who seeing us, and in what state we were,
In due compassion could not well forbeare
From shedding teares, so soone as he had found
Our red-bath'd Corpes fast glewed to the ground.
Oft did he reare our Bodies, but in vaine,
For breathlesse they fell to the Earth againe;
Oft did he rub our temples to restore
That vitall heat, which was supprest before:
But without hope of life, though life was there,
As Men of Earth, did we on Earth appeare.
At last assisted by a Swaine or two,
(See what the Providence of Heaven can doe)
We were conveyed to a Graunge hard by,
Whereto were Surgeons sent immediatly,
Whose learned skill drain'd from experience,
Brought us in time to have a little sense
Of our endanger'd state.

DYMNUS.
But pray thee tell
Whose hand exprest most art?

DORYCLES.
Grave Astrophel,
Whose knowne experiments of Art have showne
More noble cures of late on this our Downe,
Than all our Mountebankes could ever doe,
For all these precious drugs they value so.

SAPPHUS.
Indeed I know He has much honour won
For his admired Cures; good Shepheard on.

DORYCLES.
Having long languish'd betwixt life and death,
Remov'd from thought of love for want of breath,
As men we liv'd expos' to dangers Sconce.

LINUS.
Would not Bellina see thee?

DORYCLES.
Nere but once.
For having heard there was no way but one,
And that in all mens judgements I was gone,
Shee straight resolves to finde a cure for care,
That if I liv'd she might have one to spare.

TECHNIS.
Why, made shee choice of any but thy selfe?

DORYCLES.
Yes Technis yes, and of a dwarfish elfe,
Whom she preferr'd, (though he could little please).
Before her first love, haplesse Doricles.

TECHNIS.
Inconstant Swainlin.

DORYCLES.
Having heard of this,
You may conceave how griefe augmented is:
I straight depriv'd of hope, began to rave,
And would not take what my Physician gave,
But scorning all prescriptions valued death
Above a languishing distastfull breath;
Till by perswasion and recourse of time
Those braine-sicke passions and effects of mine
Depressed were:  so as upon a day,
The burden of my sorrowes to allay,
And to expresse the nature of my wrong,
I set my hand to pen, and made a Song.

DYMNUS.
Good Dorycles let's heare what it may be,
It cannot but be good if't come from thee.

DORYCLES.
Shepheards you shall; and if you thinke it fit,
I lov'd her once, shall be the Tune of it.

TECHNIS.
No Tune more proper; to it lovely Swaine.

DORYCLES.
Attend then Shepherds to my dolefull straine.

The fairest faire that ever breath'd ayre,
Feeding her Lambkins on this Plaine;
To whom though many did repaire,
I was esteem'd her dearest Swaine.
To me she vow'd, which vow she broke,
That she would fancie me or none,
But since she has her Swaine forsooke,
I'le take me to a truer one.

Had she beene firme, as she was faire,
Or but perform'd what she had vow'd,
I might have sung a fig for care,
And safely swum in fancies flood;
But O the staine of womanhood!
Who breakes with one, keepes touch with none;
Wherefore in hate to such a brood,
I'le take me to a truer one.

Was't not enough to breake her vow,
And quit my love with such disdaine,
But scornfully deride me too,
With scoffes to gratifie my paine?
But since my labours are in vaine,
Ile spend no more my time in mone,
But will my former love disclaime,
And take me to a truer one.

Who ever liv'd and shew'd more love,
Or lesse exprest what she did show?
Who seeming firme so false could prove,
Or vow so much, and slight her vow?
But since I doe her nature know,
I am right glad that she is gone;
For if I shoot in Cupids bow,
I'le take me to a truer one.

More faithlesse faire nere spoke with tongue,
Or could protest lesse what she thought;
Nere Shepheard suffer'd greater wrong,
Or for lesse profit ever wrought;
But since my hopes are turn'd to nought,
May never Heardsman make his mone
To one whose mold's in weaknesse wrought,
But take him to a truer one.

CORYDON.
May all poore Swaines be henceforth warn'd by thee;
But didst thou never since Bellina see?

DORYCLES.
Yes, and her lovely spouse Archetus too,
Who seeing me (quoth he) There doth he goe,
Who on a time, as I enformed am,
Would lose his Lasse before he lost his Ram;
Which I retorted, saying, I thought best,
My butting Ram should be his worships crest,
Whose broad-spread frontless did presage what fate
Would in short time attend his forked pate.

SAPPHUS.
Thou hit him home my Dorycles; but say,
What said she to thee?

DORYCLES.
Bit lip, and away;
Though the next morne, my sorrow to renew,
Shee sent a Willow wreath fast bound with Rew,
Which I accepted, but that I might show
I never rue her breach of promise now,
The Rew that tyde my Wreath I threw aside,
And with Hearts ease my Willow garland tyde.

LINUS.
A good exchange.

DORYCLES.
Now Shepheards you have heard
My faithfull love, and her unjust reward;
Did ever Swaine enjoy the light of Sunne,
That bare such injuries as I have done?

TECHNIS.
Indeed thy wounds were great;

DYMNUS.
Yet mine as wide.

DORYCLES.
I mist my Love, and lost my bloud beside.

DYMNUS.
Suspend thy judgement, and thine eare incline
Unto my Tale, and thou wilt yeeld to mine.

CORYDON.
Let's have it Dymnus;

DYMNUS.
Heardsman so thou shalt,
Yet if I weepe, impute it to the fault
Of my surcharged heart, which still appeares
The best at ease, when eyes are full'st of teares.
