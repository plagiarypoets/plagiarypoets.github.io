STREPHON.
Heav'n bless my Eyes!  what's this I see!
Damon, the Prince of Jollity,
With down-cast Look, and languid Air,
Without his Pipe, without his Care!
I thought, from hence a distant Way,
I met your little Flock astray;
But why unguarded and alone?
What have the harmless Wand'rers done!

DAMON.
Ah!  Strephon, have you never seen
A Nymph, the fairest on the Green,
As strait as yonder Poplars rise,
With blooming Cheeks, and smiling Eyes?
For whom I oft', in Heat and Cold,
Have led the tender Flock to Fold;
For whom I cropt the Violet blue,
The Pink, and Rose of ruddy Hue;
And thought myself then doubly blest,
When she had plac'd them in her Breast.

STREPHON.
Yes, Shepherd, I remember well,
On May-Day last, when Blowzabel,
With all her little Arts, assay'd
To win you from the beauteous Maid,
T' have seen the purple Current flow
Beneath a Skin as white as Snow,
T' have heard the Virgin's tender Sighs,
Whene'er on you she turn'd her Eyes.

DAMON.
Strephon, forbear; I was to blame,
To teaze her with an acted Flame;
For Blowzabel was false I knew,
As false as Florimel was true;
Ah!  Florimel, bereft of thee,
What's Flocks of bleating Sheep to me!
With thee the Hours flew amain,
'Twas Morn, 'twas Night, 'twas Morn again!
And all a single Moment seem'd,
While silly We, alas!  but dream'd.

STREPHON.
Unhappy Swain!  too well I guess
The Cause of thy Unhappiness;
But Death, you know, must be endur'd,
And Griefs the strongest may be cur'd.
Remember Thyrsis, how he cry'd,
When, late, his Rosalinda dy'd;
He broke his Crook, he chid his Sheep,
And made the stoutest Swain to weep,
When he related, wond'rous well,
What Omens did her Death foretel;
How little Tray a Grave had made,
Without the Use of Showl or Spade,
How oft' the Death-Watch had been heard,
Whose Clicking makes the Maids afeard;
And how the Hen, who us'd to cluck,
Crow'd thrice, as loud as any Cock;
The very Hen, that always lay
Upon her Apron every Day:
Ungrateful Hen!  and then he'd groan,
Sure 'twould have griev'd a Heart of Stone.
Where's, now, his Grief for Rosey's Charms?
Why, all forgot in Chloe's Arms.

DAMON.
Too well I know that such there be;
But, Strephon, think not thus of me:
No never, never, be it said,
That Damon sought a second Bed!

STREPHON.
Well, weep your fill, but make no Vows,
Lest, perjur'd, you again should 'Spouse:
Tears rather ease, than do us hurt;
But Vows too sacred are for Sport.
See Seraphina in High Life,
Well born, well-bred, no Shepherd's Wife,
Who Half so gay?  appears a Bride,
Where six Months since her dearest dy'd.
How great, how real was her Grief?
How vain the Task to speak Relief?
Who saw her Tears, that could refrain?
Or heard her sigh, but sigh'd again?
You'll say, perhaps, 'twas insincere:
No, Love alone drew every Tear;
She, rich in Tears, did, in a Day,
The Tribute of a Twelve-month pay.
A Twelve-month past, fond Custom cries,
Ye weeping Widows, dry your Eyes;
But why a Twelve-month, and no more?
It might as well impose a Score:
Meer Custom, be it good or bad,
Can neither merry make, nor sad:
The Grief-struck Heart in Tissue bleeds,
While merry Faces lurk in Weeds;
Nor best nor worst, alike are they,
Who mourn a Year, or mourn a Day,
They'll wed again their Grief's well o'er;
And Seraphina's done no more.

DAMON.
O sooth my Woes!  or Words forbear!
Such Lightness but offends my Ear.
Six little Months!  nay barely six!
E'er one was cold, again to fix!
But she's a Woman; and the Wind
Is steadier far than Womankind.

STREPHON.
Are Women such, why weep you then?
Give o'er, and act like other Men,
Who, in the Grave their Comfort laid,
Seek Comfort in some willing Maid.

DAMON.
Nor was she Woman whom I wail;
Nor bad Example shall prevail;
She from her Sex distinguish'd stood,
Tho' fair, more fam'd for being good;
Their was her Form, not theirs her Mind,
That was no Part of Womankind!
I may, when such appears agen,
Uncensur'd, act like other Men.

STREPHON.
Damon, adieu, let me advise,
For crying does but spoil your Eyes;
Resume your Pipe, collect your Sheep,
And to yourself your Sorrows keep;
For trust me, as you're Flesh and Blood,
You'll wed, and think the next as good.
