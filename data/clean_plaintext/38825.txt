'Twas in the solemn Hour of Night,
That Hour when Ghosts return,
O'er the dank Grave, the Joys of Life,
For ever lost, to mourn.

In yon Cathedral Church-Yard, whence
Those hardy Sons of Toil,
Bear with unhallow'd Hands away
The consecrated Soil,

Pale Sprights, with Horrour, view'd the Deep
Where late the Bodies lay;
Where now, in vain, they wish'd to sit
Fast by the breathless Clay.

And thus a Voice, in plaintive Tone,
The solemn Silence broke;
The D&mdash; heard not, or e'en the D&mdash;
Had trembled while it spoke&mdash;

"Was it for this, with fun'ral Dress
Each lifeless Corpse was grac'd!
Was it for this, with pious Care,
Each in his Grave was plac'd!

"Was it for this,  the white-rob'd Priest
The Farewell Blessing shed;
And promis'd here unbroken Rest,
Within Earth's hallow'd Bed!

"Was it to be by ruthless Hands,
Again dragg'd forth to Day;
To have the Bones, yet unconsum'd,
Bestrew the publick Way!

"Be it his Fate, who tears them hence
With unrelenting Mind,
Ne'er in the silent Womb of Earth
A peaceful Grave to find.

"Let no proud Marble tell his Name
In monumental Praise,
Boasting that num'rous Deeds of Worth
Adorn'd his Length of Days:

"But on some Dunghill be it thrown,
And near it be there read,
Chalk'd on some Wall &mdash; See his Reward
Who dar'd disturb the Dead!"
