Nymph of the mountain-stream, thy foaming urn
Wastes its pure waters on the rock below;
There no green herbage shall a leaf return,
No plant can flourish and no flow'r can blow;
Stern Solitude, whose frwon the heart appals,
Dwells on the heath-clad hills, around thy waterfalls.

Yet not in vain thy murm'ring fountain flows,
It cheers the wand'rer in the dreary waste;
Awakes dull Silence from his deep repose,
And charms the eye, the ear, the soul, of taste.
For this the grateful muse in fancy twines,
Around thy urn, the rose and waving wild woodbines.

And when far distant from the glowing scene
Of castles, winding straths, and tufted woods,
From Lomond's fairy banks, and islands green,
His cloud-capt moutains, and his silver floods;
Mem'ry shall turn in many a waking dream,
To meet thee, lonely Nymph!  beside thy mountain-stream.
