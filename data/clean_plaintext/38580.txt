Ye shepherds who cheerfully pipe through the day,
Attend to a lover's enraptured lay;
His song is of beauty, you love the dear theme,
For ELIZA and beauty are ever the same.

Give joy to the village where beauty resides,
Where sweet sensibility sweetly presides,
Where virtue triumphant enjoys a soft reign,
For ELIZA and virtue are ever the same.

I know your good hearts will accord in the praise
Of all the bright precepts which virtue conveys;
Rejoice, where with virtue true wisdom I name,
For ELIZA and wisdom are ever the same.

The Graces adorn and embellish the fair,
To you, my dear shepherds, the Graces are dear;
Then haste and do homage to her I proclaim,
For ELIZA and gracefulness still are the same.

O!  should the dear maiden, inspir'd from above,
But smile on fond DAMON, who dies for her love;
Dear shepherds! how joyfully should I exclaim,
ELIZA and happiness now are the same!
