Hence!  far hence, corroding care,
Envy foul, and black despair:
Hence be banish'd every pain,
Looks demure, and cold disdain.

Welcome mirth, and festive song,
Welcome all thy jocund throng;
Be thou, and only thou our guide,
Ev'ry gloomy thought deride.

Blythsome let us sing and play,
All the gladsome, live-long day:
Life was form'd for joy and love,
Emblem of the state above.

Fill, then, fill the flowing glass,
Chearful let the goblet pass;
While the sprightly health goes round,
Let the jovial rebecs sound.

Happy!  truly happy he!
Ever tranquil, ever free,
Who enjoys a state so blest,
By nor cares or fears distrest.
