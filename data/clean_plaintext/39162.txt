The Grove, when Cibber, violating trode,
Night fell, and gloom'd the Muses' green abode,
With rumbling notes the rumbling echoes  ring
Each Muse affrighted, clos'd her secret spring.
But sudden, o'er the fading clouds of night,
The day-spring stream'd its animating light;
Soft notes from Castaly's fair bowers were flung;
The Muses listen'd as their Whitehead sung.
Warton, collecting every burning ray,
Mounts high, and pours a blazing noon of day.
His Gothic grandeur won the musing train,
And Spenser, smiling, lov'd his own sweet strain.
Now breaks a milder beam, more soft, more fair,
A chasten'd radiance on the glowing air;
'Tis thus on evening skies, so lovely bright,
Shines the departing gleam of the impurpling light.
