Don't you see yon lofty mountain,
Where the wanton lambies play,
Round an' round the crystal fountain,
Springin' frae the sunny brae.

Round its summits, beat wi' weather,
See, it wears a purple crown;
Made o' bonny bloomin' heather,
Beauties wild, but Nature's own!

There the mountain daisies blossom;
There the tender vi'lets bloom;
There the thyme, spread on its bosom,
Fills the air with sweet perfume.

How romantic is the prospect!
Down below there winds a lake,
There are fishes bred an' foster'd;
So are fowls that haunt the brake.

There the cunning foxie, hiding,
Mocks his cruel hunter's rage;
Hawks and ravens, there residing,
In perpetual wars engage.

From these rugged prospects turn ye;
Mark yon rauntree spreading wide,
Where the clear, but noisy burnie
Rushes down the mountain's side.

There a lovely bloomin' shepherd
Every day a while reclin'd,
There, in accents soft, related
Thus, his love and tortur'd mind.

"Pity me, ye tender lovers!
You can guess at what I bear;
Once caress'd, but now another
Has her heart, to me sae dear.

"When I first beheld my KEATIE,
I forgot to hear or see;
A' the girls I prized lately,
Ne'er were minded mair by me.

"Hame I came, but took nae dinner,
Went to bed, but sleepit nane;
Young, an' blate, an' quite a stranger,
What to do I didna ken.

"Ten lang days I thought upon her,
Quite depriv'd o' peace an' rest;
Findin' I cude bruik nae langer,
I resolv'd to do my best.

"Now my yellow hair I plaited,
Gae my downy chin a shave,
Thrice my tales of love repeated,
Fearin' I would misbehave.

"Far away I took my journey,
Left our hills sae high an' green,
Thro' a pleasant fertile country,
Which I ne'er before had seen.

"Here we're charm'd wi' works o' Nature,
Craggy cliff, an' lonely glen;
There I oft stood like a statue,
Wond'ring at the works o' men.

"Verdant pastures, grand inclosures,
Thrivin' woods, an' buildins new,
Hale hill sides sawn up wi' clover,
Ev'ry where arose in view.

"Lang I gaed, an' kendna whither,
Struck wi' ilka thing I saw,
Where yon little windin' river
Murmurs owr the stanes sae sma'.

"Phebus, now in all his glory,
Sunk into the western main;
Frae his labour, soft and slowly,
Hameward trudg'd the weary swain.

"Nature, freed frae her auld lover,
Roughsome Winter, gaunt and lean;
Spring to charm whase airs had mov'd her,
Rob'd herself in chearfu' green.

"A' the little feather'd tenants
Sweetly sung on ilka tree;
Lads an' lasses, wives and callants,
A' war gay but lonely me.

"Walkin' thro' the elms sae stately,
Thinkin' on the step I'd ta'en,
There I met my bony KEATY,
Comin thro' the wood her lane.

"Fear'd an' fond, when I approach'd her,
How my heart began to beat!
But I ventur'd to accost her,
Askin' where she gaed so late?

"Wi' a smile, that quite bewitch'd me,
She return'd, 'What's that to thee?
Ere you reach the town that's next ye,
Lad, ye'll be as late as me.'

"Mony question I speer'd at her,
Mony ane I kend fu' weel,
If an inn stood on the water,
Where a stranger wad get biel?

"Where she liv'd, an' what they ca'd her,
Father's name, an' mother's too,
Ilka burn an' ilka  water,
Ilka house within our view.

"Lang we stood amang the timber,
Frae me she could never win;
Now the sterns began to glimmer,
Drowsy Twilight clos'd his een.

"'Shepherd,' said she, 'I wad thank ye,
Wad ye turn an' set me hame;
Ghaists an' witches are sae plenty,
I'm afraid to gang my lane.

"'When we reach my father's dwellin,
Ye's hae bed an' supper free;
They'll requite ye, when I tell them
How ye've been sae kind to me.'

"Happy in the fair occasion,
How I blest her bonny face,
Nor refus'd the invitation,
Proffer'd me wi' sic a grace.

"Hand in hand, away we waukit;
She was pleas'd, an' I was fain;
Tho' on others' loves we taulkit,
Never durst I name my ain.

"Till we reach'd yon willow bushes,
Pretty bushes, sweet an' green!
How her face o'erspread wi' blushes,
Shepherds, O!  had you but seen.

"Think nae shame, my bonny KEATIE,
Come sit down an' rest a while;
I've, in hopes mysel' to get thee,
Travell'd mony a weary mile.

"'Shepherd, cease your vain entreating,
Here wi' thee I will not stay;
My poor parents will be fretting,
I have staid sae late away.

"'Think ye, I'll neglect my duty,
For a fond an' foolish boy;
Love that's merely rais'd by beauty,
Seldom fails in haste to cloy.'

"Hold, my dearest, I implore thee;
Hear me swear by all above&mdash;
Ere I cease for to adore thee,
Earth no more shall harbour love.

"Solway's stream shall swell the Teviot,
Eilden hills unite in ane,
Tweed rin owr the tops o' Cheviot,
Berwick stand at Eric stane.

"Pity me, my bonny lassie;
Come, sit down, an' think nae shame;
In my bosom let me house thee;
Here ye're safer than at hame.

"'Let me first go ease my parents;
When they've seen me safely home,
I'll return and prove those talents,
Seemingly for flatt'ry form'd.'

"Where the stream, wi' mony a turnie,
Wimpled thro' the sandy plain,
Willows, loutin, kiss'd the burnie,
There I'm left to lie my lane.

"From yon eastern summit bending,
Orions radiant circle beams;
Venus, in the west descending,
Flames like light'ning on the streams.

"Hail, ye stars that o'er my hover!
Hail, ye beaming orbs of light!
Shine propitious on a lover,
Shed your influence here to night!

"Oft, to ev'ry care unused,
When the day-light ceas'd to shine;
Oft on you I've gaz'd and mused;
Oft ador'd that pow'r divine,

"Who those fluid films, that wheeled
Loosely thro' primaeval night,
By a breath to worlds congealed;
Masses of illuvid light!

"From his hand then bowl'd you flaming,
Thro' old dreary Night's domain:
Order straight thro' nature reigning,
Dungeon Darkness smil'd serene.

"Now the joys of contemplation
On such things, to me seem nought;
Lovely she, whose sweet discretion
Left me here, pervades each thought.

"Back she came, I kiss'd, I woo'd her,
Row'd her gently in my plaid;
Where we lay, till Phoebus shew'd her
To my eyes the loveliest maid.

"E'er me thought the sun arose on,
When she bade me rise an' gang,
Mind my vows, my faith repose on,
An' come back ere it was lang.

"Mony letter I sent to her,
Mony raik I gaed mysel';
Never was a luckier wooer,
Never lover us'd so well.

"Now she's quite ta'en up wi' Jokey;&mdash;
Woman, thou'rt a mystery!
What, alas!  was all her motive?
He was twice as rich as me.

"I had plenty, wi' a blessing,
Plenty baith for her an' me:
O my Keatie!  what was missing!
Lack of gold has startl'd thee.

"Yet, my bonny smilin' lassie,
Thou are never frae my sight;
Thou'rt my sorrow, joy, an fancy,
Thought by day, an' dream by night.

"Weel I mind the weeping willow,
Weel I mind the riggs o' rye,
Weel the primrose grove so yellow,
Often prest by you an' I.

"Fare-ye-weel, my bonny Keatie,
Happy ever may you be;
Live to love the lad that gets ye;
Never spend a thought on me.

"If I die, I die wi' pleasure;
If I live, I'll live in pain&mdash;
Thee, my dearest, chiefest treasure!
Thee I'll never see again.

"Mirth and music, now I hate ye;
'Dieu ye swains an' lasses fair;
Since I've lost my bonnie Keatie,
I can live nor love nae mair."

Up spake Jamie, young an' wittie,
"Willie, ye are quite mistaen;
A' the love ye bear for Keatie,
Keatie bears for you again.

"When I saw ye sad and wae man,
I a project straight did try,
Passing for a wond'rous spae-man,
Through the country travell'd I.

"Wi' a bonnet, auld an' cloutit,
Silver locks, an' hollow een;
Coat an' cloak, ye wad hae doubtit
What had their orig'nal been.

"Having a' their stories fitted;
Bred amang them frae my youth,
Whatsoever I predicted,
Past wi' them for gospel truth.

"Soon I fand that Keaty lov'd ye,
Wi' a heart baith true an' leel,
That she'd try'd a scheme to prove ye,
Happy when ye took it ill.

"Now, like you, she's sad an' fretty,
Frae her cheeks the roses fly;
When I tald her she wad get ye,
Gladness sparkl'd in her eye."

Shepherds, wad ye hear the issue?
WILL an' KEAT their wishes prove:
Happy pair!  sure Heav'n will bless you,
And reward your constant love.

Constancy an' perseverance
Ever will rewarded be;
Tho' I sing wi' little rev'rence,
Heav'n to their rights will see.
