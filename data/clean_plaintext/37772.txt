Approach, sweet evening, thou all-welcome shade!
And bring thy balmy dusk to ease my eyes,
Wearied with lights of vanity and woe.
Hide me from vice's glitt'ring gilded train,
And let me turn my eyes upon myself,
That I with meditating search may pry,
And root out all the errors of my heart.
Let thy companion, SLEEP, attend thy steps,
And in his downy arms my senses soothe
With gentle dreams inspiring harmless joy;
Or when the broad-ey'd regent calls thee forth,
To view her course, as she encircled rides
Amidst the ever glorious pomp of stars,
Let contemplation lift me above the spheres,
To think; and in my secret grateful heart,
With adoration bow sincere before
The great Creator of that orb and ours!
