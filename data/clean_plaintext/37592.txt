My Lord now quits his venerable seat,
The Six Clerk on his padlock turns the key,
From business hurries to his snug retreat,
And leaves vacation, and the town to me.

Now all is hush'd, asleep the eye of care,
And Lincoln's Inn a solemn stillness holds,
Save where the porter whistles o'er the square,
Or Pompey barks, or basket woman scolds,

Save that from yonder pump, and dirty stair,
The moping shoe-black and the laundry-maid,
Complain of such as from the town repair,
And leave their little quarterage unpaid.

In those dull chambers where old parchments lie,
And useless drafts in many a mould'ring heap,
Each for parade to catch the client's eye,
Salkeld and Ventris in oblivion sleep.

In these dead hours what now remains for me,
Still to the stool and to the desk confined,
Debarr'd from Autumn shades, and liberty
Whose lips are soft as my Cleora's kind.

Hail, beauteous nymph!  How does thy presence gild
The brow of care, and mitigate my pains!
With thee (such ecstacy thy beauties yield)
Bondage is free, and hugs thy pleasing chains.

Blest in thy love, sincerely I despise
The quibble, warmly urged with many a frown,
Hear each opinion of the learn'd and wise,
Nor envy Cato's wig, or Tully's gown.
