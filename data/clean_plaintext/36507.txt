'Tis Night, and darkness boasts her sable reign,
Save that the stars with twinkiling aspects shine,
Relieve the gloom that hovers o'er the plain,
And fill the breast with extasy divine;
O may these joyous feelings still be mine,
Not fill'd with pride and fell ambition vain,
And all in silence, save the distant bell,
That rings some soul's departed funeral knell.

Ah!  from this heart how soon have flown its joys,&mdash;
Gone like the bright beams of the noon-tide sun;
No gentle pleasure this sad heart employs,
Altho' its mad career has scarce begun:
In truth I wish its fickle course was done,
Disgusted with the world's unmeaning toys,
Which strive to lure me from the paths of right,
And then desert me to the shades of Night.

Yes, Night is soothing to a sick'ned mind,
Sicken'd by Flattery's delusive pow'r,
Fit only for the weaker part of womankind,
Who love its gentle influence for an hour,
Till by it all their virtue we devour.
But Night restores the vigor of my mind,
When, from the hated race of man set free,
I chaunt my evening's notes like nightingale on tree.
