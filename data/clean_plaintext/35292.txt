Deep in a cave her dreary dwelling lay,
Impervious to the chearful light of day;
Nor heaven's soft breath had fann'd the stagnant air,
But cold and darkness reign'd eternal there:
Within sat Envy, on her restless seat,
O'er vices brooding, vipers flesh for meat;
Serpents half-eaten, strewed around the floor,
Long cover'd with the black, and clotted gore.
Haggard, and lean, her shrivel'd body bent,
Alone on mischief anxiously intent;
A deadly paleness o'er her face was spread,
A snaky fillet bound her hideous head;
Her scatter'd teeth with filthy rust were stain'd,
And half reveal'd, and half unseen remain'd.
Her bloated tongue with adders poison fill'd,
And liquid death its forked point distill'd.
Two deep-sunk sockets her green eyes infold,
Which o'er afflicted virtue gladly roll'd.
Slowly she rose, and with a thorny band
A staff she wreathed with her trembling hand;
With steps unequal then she bent her way,
To breathe pestiferous on the blush of day.
Now wrap'd in noisome clouds she rolls along
The peaceful village, or the city's throng;
The fertile fields are blasted by her power,
The fragrant rose, the amaranthine bower;
Nor beauty's form, nor virtue's sacred cell,
Where love and innocence delight to dwell,
Can shield against the envenom'd shaft she hurls,
Nor check the wheel deserted envy whirls:
Shun her, ye fair, or all your charms are vain,
Your beauty blighted, and your pleasure vain.
