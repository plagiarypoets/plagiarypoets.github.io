Yes, she was beauteous!  and, a beaming light,
Mild, and yet bright, across her temples play'd,
Like the soft blush of twilight, ere the night
Hath cast around her melancholy shade.
She was, in sooth, perfection's dearest maid;
One, in whose eye, e'en Virtue might discern
Her lovely self reflected and display'd;
Whose fore-head was a book, where Guilt might learn
How blest that innocence, from which he'd dar'd to turn.

So freely hung the ringlets of her hair,
That it did seem uncertain, if design
Or Nature's self had plac'd them as they were;
And o'er her bosom they did brightly shine,
Like angels guarding Virtue's sainted shrine.
There was a sweet expression round her brow,
Which conquer'd hearts &mdash; at least it conquer'd mine;
And I, who laugh'd at Cupid's pow'r, must now
Borrow his softest sigh, and breathe his tend'rest vow.

Oh!  I have stood to gaze upon her eye,
Until my soul seem'd parting with that gaze;
For, it was blue and beauteous as the sky,
When not a shadow o'er its surface strays;
And it cast forth such melancholy rays
Of soft and secret passion, that I cried,
"How sweetly, one expressive glance repays
Whole years of cold indifference and pride,
And all the doubts and fears which are to love allied!"
