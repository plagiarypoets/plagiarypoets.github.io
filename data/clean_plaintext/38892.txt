Thou Blessing sent us from above,
Rich Offspring of celestial Love!
Fair Hope!  thy Presence let me hail,
When Grief intrudes, when Pains assail,
O'er Life's rough Sea, amid the Tempest's Roar,
Pilot my rolling Bark, and set me safe on Shore.

'Tis thine, when Troubles rack the Heart,
Thy  lenient Balsam to impart.
This Load of Life, oh!  who cou'd bear,
Didst thou  not aswage each galling Care?
Thy Frowns all human Happiness destroy;
Thy Smiles dawn Peace upon the Soul, and endless Joy.

The Wretch, of ev'ry Friend bereft,
(By Kindred scorn'd, by Fortune left)
The Orphan plung'd in Seas of Care,
The widow'd Wife, the injur'd Heir,
Thro' the dark Cloud, that intercepts thy Blaze,
Perceive thy glimm'ring Light, and own thy cheating Rays.

Repentants gasping out their Breath,
And struggling with convulsive Death,
Faintly lift up their dying Eyes,
While Nature tells her Pangs in Sighs;
To thee their ardent, genuine Wishes lend,
Implore thy healing Aid, and in thee find a Friend.

Supported by thy kindly Hand,
The Patriot, in a sinking Land,
Anxious to prop a falling State,
Smiles at Fatigue, serenely great;
Retorts the Dart of Malice, truely brave,
And boldly stems the Force of Faction's rapid Wave.

The Law's Delay, the Lover's Pain,
Oppression's Whip, Confinement's Chain,
The Scorn of Pride, and Guilt's keen Smart,
Would soon subdue the lab'ring Heart:
But thou step'st in, the drooping Soul to raise,
And giv'st a future Prospect of more pleasing Days.

Why may not Britain then once more
Strike Terror to proud France's Shore?
Hence, fell Despair! &mdash; Go, fix thy Throne
In Gallic Breasts; THERE reign alone:
HOPE still in England lives; nor will she die,
'Till George, and George's Race, ascend the greeting Sky.
