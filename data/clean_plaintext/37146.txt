When sorrow presses on the care-worn breast,
And wakes to agony the nerve of pain;
When recollection paints the scenes once blest,
And the soul sickens at the vapid train
Of earth's delusive hopes, false, mutable, and vain:

When sickness palls each effort to remove
The gloom of languor from the hour of care;
Blest be the impulse, which, from heav'nly love,
Leads the sad mourner to the house of pray'r
To seek the dawn of peace, the source of comfort there!

There to pour out the heart which pants for rest,
With fervour kindling at Devotion's fane,
To him whose holy influence the breast,
By woe subdu'd, with firmness can sustain,
And where wild sorrows throbb'd, bid peace all soothing reign.

And there the humble supplication raise,
Th' unutter'd pray'r, which sighs to be forgiv'n;
Or join to swell the grateful note of praise,
While the rapt soul, no more by tempest driv'n,
From hope's mild op'ning dawn, anticipates her heav'n.

There, too, to listen to the sacred lore,
When heav'n-taught wisdom truths sublime display;
Blest truths!  which teach the suff'ring soul to soar
Above the toils of this drear, rugged way,
And seek, beyond yon radiant skies, still brighter day.

O!  hope triumphant!  sorrow's blest relief!
Still o'er my soul diffuse thy balm divine:
Bid her press forward though the storms of grief,
Strew the dark path to death's allotted line;
Beyond, conceiveless joys, and ever during, shine.
