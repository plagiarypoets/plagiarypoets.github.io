Dear Sk**r!  thy conduct to repay
In words (alas, I fail in deed!)
I choose this melancholy day,
Fondly to frame the grateful meed;
Day of my birth!  a day to anguish long decreed.

Should time some transient joys impart,
To thee my lengthening years I owe;
Sooth'd by thy kindness, by thy art
Still rising from the bed of woe!
This wreath, by virtue won, let friendship glad bestow.

But O, my friend!  the prospect lours;
The tempest, usher'd with the morn,
Frowns darkly on life's coming hours;
No rays yon desart coast adorn,
Where all is heartless hope, and solitude forlorn!

Avail'd it, then, thy skill to save
Me, ling'ring on the shadowy grave?
From death recall'd, but call'd to brave
Anew misfortune's whelming roar!
By thee the body lives, the mind no balms restore.

Yet &mdash; if the Town deign now to hear
The simple music of my lyre;
If to a few my name be dear;
Or I to bolder hopes aspire;
Not from the voice of praise do thou, the cause!  retire.
