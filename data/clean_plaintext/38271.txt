Ne gey Atire, ne Marble Hall,
Ne Arched Roof, ne Painted Wall,
Ne Cook of Fraunce, ne Dainted Board
Bestrew'd with Pyes of Perrygord,
Ne Power, ne such like idle Fauncies,
Sweet Agnes, grant to Father Frauncis.

Let me ne more myself deceive,
Ne more regret the Toys I leave;
The World I quit, the Proud, the Vain,
Corruption, and Ambition's Strain;
But not the Good (pardie) nor Fair;
'Gainst them I make ne Vow, ne Prayer;
Be such aye wellcome to my Cell,
And oft, not alway, with me dwell.

Then cast, sweet Saint, a Circle round,
And guard from Fools this Holy Ground;
From all the Foes to Worth and Truth,
From wanton Eld, and homely Youth;
The gravely Dull, and pertly Gay;
O Banish these &mdash; and, by my Fay,
Right well I ween, that in this Age
Mine House shall prove an Hermitage.
