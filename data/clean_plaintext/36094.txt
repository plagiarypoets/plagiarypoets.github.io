Lingering I gazed upon that ghastly crowd,
And there behold what I can scarce relate,
Upon my sole avouch, without a cloud
Of witness behind: &mdash; my steady mate
Unshrinking Conscience, under whose breast-plate
Of truth, and sentiment serene and pure,
A man may stand, and freely face his fate&mdash;
She urges me to tell all out &mdash; secure
Of the event, as one who of his facts is sure.

Certain I saw, and still, methinks, I view
A body moving on without a head,
As moved the others of that wretched crew&mdash;
The hand that head held firmly, &mdash; and instead
Of lamp or lantern, the blind feet it led
Grasped by the locks: &mdash; it glared on us, and "woe,"
It cried, "woe, woe," &mdash; as on the spectre sped&mdash;
So here were two in one, and one in two,
By what mysterious link, who linked alone can know.

Soon as the shape right at the bridge's base
Stood fixed, the arm was stretched to its height,
Raising close up to me this grisly face,
That not a word might 'scape me &mdash; "Here's a sight
Of horror for thee, whate'er living wight
Thou art, who visitest these seats of pain:&mdash;
Hast met with damned ghost in such a plight
As this? &mdash; But wouldst thou give to earth again
My name and story, (thus the phantom spoke me plain,)

"Know that my name is Bertrand, he of Born,
Who to King John gave counsels of such guilt,
That son 'gainst father raised rebellion's horn&mdash;
Not worse Achitophel, who hilt to hilt
Set Absolom and David in foul tilt:
And thus, by retribution stern, but just,
As I the bond of nature's junction spilt
Dissevering hearts that rest on sacred trust,
So is this plotting head dissevered from its bust."
