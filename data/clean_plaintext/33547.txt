Priscus doth poetize now he's in love;
Strange each blind Lover should a Poet prove;
He is inspired sure, how els could he
Be such a Chymist in Loves Poetrie?
He courts his Mistris out of Ovids art
Has th' Amadis and Spencer all by heart,
Whence he extracts his sonnets, and his rime,
And speaks them, dreaming, in and out of time.
Such sudden raptures seldome constant be,
His love is blind, and so's his Poetrie.
