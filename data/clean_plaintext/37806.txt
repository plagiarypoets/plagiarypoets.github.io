Hail!  Virgin of aetherial birth,
Thou more lovely far than Mirth,
O hither bend thy way!
Come, beauteous Nymph, serenely smiling,
Ev'ry anxious thought beguiling,
Thou mak'st each prospect gay.

Thine eye with joy young Spring beholds,
When Nature ev'ry charm unfolds,
And spreads thy fav'rite hue;
When Eurus to his cave retires,
And Zephyr fans those glowing fires
That verdant life renew.

Thou lov'st to range the fields at dawn,
Or meet the shepherds on the lawn,
At leisure Eve's advance;
Brisk Sport comes tripping o'er the mead,
And sweetly sounds his oaten reed,
And joins the rural dance.

Not e'en hoar Winter's dreary sway,
Nor freezing blast can thee dismay,
Nor change thy sprightly mien;
'Tis then thou seek'st the social band,
And o'er their minds with gentle hand,
Diffus't a joy serene.

Though absent Sol his ray denies,
Round the bright flame which Art supplies,
The friendly train regale;
Some fairy legend each imparts,
Whilst rapt Attention, gazing, starts
At ev'ry wond'rous tale.

Thy presence charms stern grief to rest,
Thy light illumes th' untainted breast,
Sweet sister of Content;
Like her thou fly'st th' abandon'd mind,
Where Guilt, Despair, and Shame combin'd,
Their hapless prey torment.

What magic in thy aspect dwells!
That Melancholy mist dispells;
What graces round thee shine!
Sweet Pleasure ever near thee stands,
With Transport, whose high soul expands,
And soars to realms divine.
