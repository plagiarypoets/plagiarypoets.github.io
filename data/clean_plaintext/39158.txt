On a bench in the garrison room,
A poor pension'd Captain was laid,
And while he bewail'd his sad doom,
A knapsack supported his head.
The Lieutenants who heard him complain,
With a sigh to his sighs did replay;
And the Ensigns, who shar'd in his pain,
Stood mournfully murmuring by.

What Folly, alas!  have I done,
(Thus sadly complaining he said),
To have chang'd my old trade for a gun,
'Twere better by far I had staid.
But I was ambitious and young,
And the name of a Captain seem'd great,
Nor did I repent it was done,
'Till now, when I find 'tis too late.

"How foolish was I to believe
The reduction would do me no wrong,
Or that I should have a reprieve,
Which the Colonel had flatter'd me long.
Poor I, who 'till now was so gay,
Must soon from my station remove,
Go cloath'd like a ploughman in grey,
Or live in a cottage on love.

"What tho' I have skill to complain,
Tho' the Muses my temples have crown'd,
And what tho' they hear my soft strain,
The Subs' all sit weeping around:
Ah, Captain, thy hopes are in vain,
Thy sash and thy gorget resign;
Thy spontoon thou must yield to a swain,
Whose regiment is older than thine.

"All ye, my companions so dear,
Who share in those hardships of mine,
Whatever you suffer, forbear,
Forbear at your fate to repine.
Our masters have sent us to range,
The wants of the state to supply,
'Twas their's to complete this great change,
And 'tis ours to be pension'd and die.

"If while my hard fate I sustain,
In their breasts any pity is found,
Let us be review'd once again,
Before I am laid in the ground.
The last humble boon that I crave,
Is to say, when they see the review,
(If they're pleas'd with the way we behave),
That they'll soon our commissions renew."
