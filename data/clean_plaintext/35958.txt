Iron-handed Goddess! &mdash; chill Adversity!&mdash;
Thou, whom the mortal race abhor and dread;
From whose stern lash, they vainly seek to fly,
Or 'scape the snare, thy toiling fingers spread!&mdash;
Oh!  thou dost laugh to scorn each petty guile,
The struggling Victim plies to burst his chain&mdash;
On Freedom's verge, thou bidst him sport awhile,
Then back re-plunged, he is thy Slave again!&mdash;
Ah!  that pale Languor o'er thy breast might creep&mdash;
A moment loose thy hold, and veil thine eye in sleep!&mdash;

Tis said, that 'neath thy rod will Virtue groan,
Shroud her fair splendour, bow her lofty mien&mdash;
And humbled to the dust, despised, alone,
No longer be, what still she boasts to have been&mdash;
Tis said, transplanted to thy freezing soil,
Genius' bright-opening bud will droop and wither&mdash;
Nipt by thy luckless grasp, no care, no toil,
Can warm to life, the germ that's wafted thither&mdash;
Tis said, to thee each power, each will resigned,
The soul resistless sinks, her grovelling doom to find.&mdash;

Frown not dread Power, altho' thy mighty fane
Should thus be slandered by reproach most vile,
The hand of Truth will brush away the stain;
And sage Experience blazon forth the wile!&mdash;
Thou art the Nurse of Virtue &mdash; harsh indeed
The tender Infant's hardened to the race!&mdash;
Thou art the spring of genius &mdash; poor the meed,
And slow the fame, that can the meed replace:
Thou art the test of good &mdash; the probing steel,
That can its truth, its nature, and its depth reveal.&mdash;

Thine are the joys, that from Religion flow&mdash;
More rapturous pure, than ought this world can yield:
Thine is the heart, that mourns another's woe,&mdash;
The fount of feeling by thy touch unsealed:
The proudest glow that firm Affection feels&mdash;
The fortitude, that strong, unbending, high,
Man, in his native dignity reveals,
From thee derive their force and majesty.&mdash;
The mask withdrawn &mdash; thou art an Angel given
To ween from this low earth, and make us meet for heaven.
