The place was thick with many a stately tree
In dim autumnal beauty arching o'er,
Shedding its painted leaves, as you might see
The marbles on some rich cathedral floor;
The sunbeams feebly pierced the branches hoar,
Touching with trembling gold the leafy gloom:
All silent there, as if the world were o'er;
Not even the redbreast waved his little plume;&mdash;
It was a place of calm &mdash; a palace of the tomb!

And in the deeper covert was a shrine,
On which seem'd sleeping laid a beauty rare;
Oh, why for this world's grandeur shall we pine,
When fadeth thus all that it hath most fair!
And with pale, marble hands uplift in prayer,
Beside her knelt, in lovely sorrow drown'd,
A sister-form, with deep-dishevelled hair,
Gazing, as if she heard the solemn sound
Of watching angels' hymns above that holy ground.
