Again Britannia's navies sweep
With victor prow the azure deep;
Again resounds her cannons' roar
In thund'ring peels from shore to shore,
And loud proclaims her boundless reign
O'er hoary Ocean's wide domain.
While Gaul her pow'r with horror views,
No more her empty threats renews,
Sunk in despair with madd'ning fury raves,
And yields to Albion's sons the empire of the waves.

Lo!  now th' applauding voice of Fame
Wafts o'er the deep her NELSON'S name:
Afric's glad sons enraptur'd glow
To see o'erwhelm'd their haughty foe;
Rush to the shore a numerous band,
To hail the saviour of their land,
Proclaim his name from pole to pole,
Far as his waves old Ocean roll:
While on brave Nelson's praise dwells every Briton's tongue,
For him are blessings pour'd, for him are paeans sung.

No more shall Gallia proudly boast,
To rear her standard on our coast;
No more her fleet triumphant ride,
'Whelm'd in old Ocean's briny tide;
Still shall Britannia's happy isle
Be blest with Plenty's bounteous smile;
Still shall fair Commerce waft her stores
On every wave to Britain's shores;
And here blest Liberty her empire keep,
And give to Britain's sons the empire of the deep.
