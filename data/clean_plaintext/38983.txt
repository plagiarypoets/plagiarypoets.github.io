When to the winds the firm oak's stately form
Sways, while each branch is as an organ-key
Dash'd to mad music by the frantic storm,
And swells the full tremendous melody,
I love amid the sounding woods to be,
And with a stern and solemn rapture hear
The straining forest's thunder &mdash; 'tis to me
An hour of awful bliss and glorious fear!&mdash;
But wilder, stranger still, swells on the ear
That shrill sound heard amid the tempest's pause,
As 'twere a Phantom's whisper, deep yet clear,
While its dread breath anew the spent blast draws:&mdash;
Sounds not that Voice, which makes the listener pale,
Like some lone Forest-Spirit's desolate wail?
