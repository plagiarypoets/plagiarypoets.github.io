Say, gentle Youthe, that tread'st untouch'd with Care,
Where Nature hathe so guerdon'd Bathe's gay Scene;
Fedde with the Songe that daunceth in the Sire;
'Midst fairest Wealthe of Flora's Magazine;
Hathe Eye or Eare yet founde, thine Steppes to blesse,
That Gem of Life, y-clep'd True Happinesse?

With Beautie restes she not; &mdash; nor Woes to lighte
Her hallowde Taper at proude Honour's Flame;
Nor Circe's Cuppe dothe crown; nor comes in Flighte
Upon th' Icarian Winge of bablinge Fame;
Not Shrine of Golde doth this fair Sainte embower,
She glides from Heav'n, but not in Danae's Shower.

Go Blossome, wanton in suche joyous Aire,
But, ah! &mdash; eft soone thy buxome Blaste is o'er!
When the sleek Pate shall grow far 'bove its Haire,
And creeping Age shall reape this piteous Lore;
To broode o'er Follie, and with me confesse,
"Earthe's flatt'ringe Dainties prove but sweete Distresse."
