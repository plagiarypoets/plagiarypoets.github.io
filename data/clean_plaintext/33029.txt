Unto your Grace the Chief of Shepherds all,
That in the British Isle your Flocks doe feed,
Your double glorious crown Imperial,
Which by your greater Mind doe farr exceed,
Yet hold not scorn of Shepherd's Oaten Reed,
Nor of the Ditties they devise among,
Your self tho' (as in all) the Soverain of Song.

Your humble Swain on lowly bended Knee,
Praying your Pardon for his hardiment,
These rude and homely Rhythms, the which you see,
With true and loyal Heart doth here present,
Fruit of your own thrice happy Government;
Whose carefull Thoughts secure the simple Sheep,
And safely guard the Shepherds selves that do them keep.

Feed on, ye blessed Flocks, devoid of Fear,
And on your Masters wise Conduct be bold;
Mean while ye loosely wander here and there,
Your Keepers wee, as Shepherds wont of Old,
Till Nights approach shall draw you to your Fold,
Play us at Pleasure, and our Pipes atame,
And tellen Tales, and chanten good King Jemies Name;

Ne might it not your Goodness ought aggreive;
Dread Sir, that been our Liege, and Lord of all,
So did the Great Augustus once give leave,
To Faithfull Tityrus his Name to call,
And daignd to hearken his rude Pastoral,
Tho' ye Augustus match, much wanten wee
Of Tityrus, yet take our Wills in gentle gree.
