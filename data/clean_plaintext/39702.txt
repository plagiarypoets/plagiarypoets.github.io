Celestial muse, who erst vouchsaf'dst to smile
On that enraptur'd bard who sung the pin
In nervous strains; deign now to lend thy aid
To one who rashly dares resume the quill;
Though far unequal to the lofty task,
To paint the noble needle's various use.

The pin contributes to adorn the belle,
To add a grace and ornamental ease;
Or save the kerchief from the boisterous wind:
But more extensive far the needle yields
Its kind assistance to the lovely fair;
Its steps the justest symmetry attends,
And order's strictest rules its train pursue,
Obedient to the beauteous hand that guides.
How oft with heart-felt pleasure have I seen
The snow-white arm of Stella nimbly move
The pointed weapon brandish'd in her hand,
To pierce the tender muslin's yielding sides!
With pleasure too I've seen the charming maid
Deck'd in the garb her industry procur'd,
Which adds a greater lustre to the fair
Than ought the loit'ring toilet's use affords;
Whose most exalted graces, when compar'd
To what the needle's power bestows, are frail,
Nor see the sun-shine of a second day;
Eclips'd and dazzled by superior charms,
Whilst those with more refulgent splendor shine;
An emblem of the power of the sun!
Which, when it beams majestically clear,
Dispels the feebler rays of Cynthia's light.
