THE ARGUMENT.
Sapphus woes Silvia,
Yet he thinks it ill,
To take to that,
Which he did never till.

THE SECOND ARGUMENT.
She, whose sweet and gracefull speech,
Might all other shepheards teach:
She, whom countries did admire,
For her presence and attire:
She, whose choise perfections mov'd,
Those that knew her to be lou'd.
She, even Silvia, for save she,
None so faire, and firme could be;
When she should be Sapphus Bride,
And their hands were to be tide
With their hearts in marriage knot,
Sapphus heares of Silvias blot.
Whereby Sapphus doth collect,
How hard it is for to affect,
Such an one as will rejoyce,
And content her in her choice;
He concludes, since all things be
Certaine in uncertaintie,
Who would trust what women say,
Who can do but what they may.
"Forts are won by foes assault,
If Maids yeeld, it is Mans fault."

I had a Love as well as any you,
And such an one, as had she but her due,
Deserv'd the service of the worthiest swaine
That ere fed sheepe upon the Westerne plaine.

DYMNUS.
Good Sapphus say, what was thy lasses name?
Was it not Silvia?

SAPPHUS.
The very same;
It seemes thou knew her.

DYMNUS.
Yes exceeding well,
And might have knowne her, but I would not mell,
In more familiar sort.

SAPPHUS.
Unworthy Swaine,
Did her affection merit such a staine?
Suppose she threw some looser lookes upon thee,
And thou collected thence she would have won thee,
Is this th' requitall of the love she bore?

DYMNUS.
Nay on good Sapphus, I'le do so no more.

SAPPHUS.
No more!  why now I sweare, and may be bold
That Dymnus would have done it if he could.
Why sir, what parts were ever in you yet,
That she on you such fancie should have set?

TECHNIS.
Fie, shepheards fie, we come not here to scold:
Come Sapphus, tell thy tale as we have told.

SAPPHUS.
Dymnus doth interrupt me.

LINUS.
Dymnus ceasse.

DYMNUS.
Nay I have done, so he will hold his peace.
But to upbraid me, that I had no part
To gaine her love, I scorne it with my heart:
For Ile avouch.

TECHNIS.
Nay then the strife's begun.

DORYCLES.
Dymnus for shame.

DYMNUS.
Nay shepheards, I have done.

DORYCLES.
Pray then proceed good Sapphus.

SAPPHUS.
Willingly:
Though I can hardly brooke this injury.

DYMNUS.
Why Sapphus, I am sure thou know'st all this,
That she was light.

SAPPHUS.
I know she did amisse,
Yet I must tell you Dymnus, 't had bene fit,
That rather I then you had noted it:
For it concern'd me most.

DYMNUS.
Pray let it rest,
I did not know so much, I may protest.

SAPPHUS.
Dymnus, enough:  and thus I do proceed;
Upon a time when I my flocks did feed,
Her father Thyrsis chanc'd to come that way,
And to observe me more, a while made stay
Upon the Downe, where I did feede my sheepe:
Who eying me, how duely I did keepe
My woollie store (as I had care) from worrien,
Scab, sought, the rot or any kind of murren:
Tooke such a liking on me, as to say
The very truth, upon next holy day,
He did invite me to his house, where I
Found what was love in lovely Silvia's eye.
In briefe, I lov'd her, I may boldly tell,
And this her father notes, and likes it well:
For oft us'd he to say, right sure I am,
A penny in a man then with a man,
He did esteeme more of, which he applide
Unto that care which he in me descride.

DYMNUS.
A jolly Swaine he was.

SAPPHUS.
He was indeed,
And on these Downs more frolicke rams did breed,
Then any Swainling that did dwell about him,
And truth to say, they would do nought without him.

DORYCLES.
Tis said that Thirsk from Thirsis tooke her name,
Who thither with his heards a grazing came,
And plaid upon his pipe such pleasant straines,
As he yet lives upon the neighbour plaines.

SAPPHUS.
This know I Dorycles, that in my hearing,
He pip'd so sweete, that many shepheards fearing
Th' melodious straines which issued from his reed,
Would so amaze their flocks they could not feede:
Joyntly together in a secret cave,
Where Palms and Mirtles their increasing have,
They so contriv'd an harbour for the nonst,
That he might from the scorching Sunne be sconst,
And sing at pleasure, while his accents raising,
Heardsmen were hearing, and their heards were grazing.
For curious seats hewne from the solid stone,
Were aptly fram'd for Swaines to sit upon,
Who in his voice conceiv'd such choice delight,
As a whole Sommer day from morne to night,
Seem'd but an houre, so sweetly did be sing,
While every day he found out some new spring.
But all too long digression have I made;
Falling in love with Silvia as I said,
I saw and perishd, perishd, for it cost
My libertie, which I by seeing lost.

DORYCLES.
Deare was that sight.

SAPPHUS.
Yet dearer may I sweare,
Was she to me, then any senses were:
For other objects I did wholly shon,
Chusing her selfe for me to looke upon.
Neither was I hope-reft, for she did seeme
To fancie me, hows'ever she did meane;
And I deserv'd it, as I thought that day,
For clothed in my suite of shepheards gray,
With buttond cap and buskins all of one,
I may assure you (heardsmen) I thought none
On all our Downe more neate or handsome was,
Or did deserve more kindnesse from his lasse.

DYMNUS.
A good conceit doth well.

SAPPHUS.
And truth was this,
She shew'd me all respect that I could wish,
And undissembled too, I am perswaded,
Though afterwards all that affection faded.
For on a day, (this I thought good to tell,
That you may thence perceive she lov'd me well)
In a greene shadie harbour I repos'd,
With Sycamours and Junipers enclos'd,
She privately into the harbour crept,
Which seene, I fain'd a sleepe, but never slept.

TECHNIS.
A faire occasion!

LINUS.
How did she reveale
Her love?

SAPPHUS.
If you had felt, what I did feele,
You never would awakt, but wisht do die,
In such a soule-beguiling phantasie.
For first she eyed me, nor contented so,
With nimble pace she to my lips did go:
And calls, and clings, and clips me round about,
Using a soft-sweete dalliance with her foote,
Not to awake me from my chearefull dreame,
But to impart what she in heart did meane;
Wherewith I seem'd to wake.

TECHNIS.
Why didst thou so?

SAPPHUS.
Technis, I thought she trod upon my toe,
But as I wak'd, she without further stay,
Dying her cheekes with blushes, stole away.

DYMNUS.
This shew'd she lov'd thee.

SAPPHUS.
So I know she did,
But who can perfect what the fates forbid?
For long we lived thus, and loved too,
With vowes as firme as faith and troth could do,
That nought should ere infringe that nuptiall band,
Confirm'd betwixt us two with heart and hand,
So as with Thirsis knowledge and consent,
After so many weekes in love-toyes spent,
It was agreed upon by either side,
That I should be her Bridegroome, she my Bride.
And th' day of Solemnization was set downe,
So as the choisest youths in all the towns,
Addrest themselves, for I was valued then
Amongst the chiefest Swaines, to be my men.

LINUS.
I know it Sapphus, both thy wealth and worth,
Were both of power enough to set thee forth.

SAPPHUS.
In briefe, for I your patience might wrong,
To stand upon these marriage rites too long;
To th' Church we went, suspecting I may sweare,
No such events as after did appeare.

TECHNIS.
What sad events, good Sapphus?

SAPPHUS.
Being now
Come to do that which we could nere undo,
The Priest pronounc'd a charge, whereby was ment,
If either of us knew impediment,
Why we should not be joyned, then to speake,
That we in time might such a wedlocke breake;
Or any one there present should shew cause,
Why we might not be married by the lawes:
There to declare, in publicke one of these,
Or else for ever after hold their peace.
God speed them well, said all, save onely one,
Who stood from thence some distance all alone,
Crying, aloud in open audience,
Sapphus forbeare, there is no conscience,
That thou should joyne thy hand to one defil'd;
At least provide a father for her child.
Which she kind pregnant wench is great withall,
And, who ere got it, will thee father call.

TECHNIS.
This was a strange prevention.

SAPPHUS.
I confesse it,
But if y'ad heard how Meuus did expresse'st,
(For so his name was) you would have admir'd
His frontlesse impudence.

DYMNUS.
Sure he was hir'd,
To frustrate these solemnities.

SAPPHUS.
Ah no,
Beleeve me Dymnus it was nothing so:
For she was fruitfull long before her time,
But th' fault was hers, it was no fact of mine:
So as her neighbours judg'd and censurd on her,
That she begun by time to take upon her.
But this shall be in silence past for me,
Onely she's shadowed in my Omphale,
And so charactred, as the time may come,
Silvia shall be as Flora was in Rome.

DORYCLES.
But what succeeded hence?

SAPPHUS.
Upon this voice
There streight arose a strange confused noise,
Some Meuus tax'd, and said he was to blame,
To blemish any modest Maidens name;
Others were doubtfull, lest it should be true,
And thus they thought, and thus it did ensue.
I now suspicious of this foule dishonour,
Which Meuus publickly had laid upon her:
Resolv'd those solemne spousals to delay,
And put them off untill another day:
Meane while, (attend me Swains) when th' day came on
That I should marrie, Silvia had a sonne.

CORYDON.
God blesse the boy.

DYMNUS.
Who might the child begit?

SAPPHUS.
Nay Dymnus sure, who ever fatherd it.

DYMNUS.
Who I!

SAPPHUS.
Nay blush not man for you have told,
You might oft-times have done it if you wold;
But I do wish her all the good I can,
And praise her choise, though I be not the man.

TECHNIS.
Unhappie choice!

DORYCLES.
Hard fate!
T'is nothing so,
You'le heare a choise more fatall ere you go.
These were but toyes to entertaine the time,
Prepare your handkerchers if you'le have mine.

ALL.
What, must we weepe?

LINUS.
Shepheards a while forbeare,
And if there be no cause, judge when you heare.
