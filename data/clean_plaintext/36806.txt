Tweed's bright blue waters &mdash; dancing in the sun
To their own music and soft zephyr's song&mdash;
When o'er their pebbly bed they laughing run,
Or smoothly glide, like happiness, along,
Seem fraught with life like thee! &mdash; when feelings strong
Stir in thy soul and sparkle in thine eye&mdash;
When new-born joys into thy bosom throng,
And brighten o'er thy face, as if the sky
Were mirror'd there, and heaven itself to earth drew nigh.

The earth's green surface, and the glassy stream&mdash;
The soft and wavy line of hills around,
Gilt by the radiance of the sun's last beam!&mdash;
Fair nature's beauty, that doth here abound,
In deep and fairy vale, in flowery mound&mdash;
All that attracts the gaze, in form or hue,
And all that meets the ear of heavenly sound,
But conjures up thy image to my view&mdash;
So much thy pure young spirit seems all things t' imbue.
