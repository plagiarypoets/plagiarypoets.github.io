Accept this Wreath, O thou who taught my hand
To blend the tints, and ev'ry flow'r to place;
If aught of sweetness, aught of blooming grace,
This Wreath, this humble Wreath, shall e'er expand,
Then take what Fancy's visionary wand
Calls forth; for well thine Eye is skill'd to trace
The rich creation of the Muse's toil.
And, oh!  if here bright Fancy deigns to smile;
And o'er the tender tints, and vernal bloom,
Her magick beams with Fairy lustre shine;
O blush not, then, my little Wreath t' assume!
Thy hand, thy gentle hand, would oft incline,
With partial love, to screen the blossoms fair;
Then may thou take the Wreath, and not repent thy care.
