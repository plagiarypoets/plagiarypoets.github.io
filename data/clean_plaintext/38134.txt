Ye Muses!  who in Fonthill's groves reside,
Break your sweet harps, and to the woods complain:
Let mournful echo catch your deep-fetch'd sighs,
And the sad sound convey to th' distant plain;
Where Britain's genius dwells, and let her know
That all her joys are fled, her triumphs turn'd to woe.

Beckford is dead!  the great, the god-like man!
Britannia's noblest son is now no more,
Who like a bulwark stood, to guard those rights
Which crown'd with freedom Britain's happy shore.
Fame hangs her trump with jetty black, and mourns the day,
When Beckford's noble soul forsook its humbler clay.

Britannia weeps!  revers'd her ensigns fall!
Fair Freedom's lambent glory sinks and fades!
Who now, she cries, will wake at freedom's call,
Or guard those laws which tyranny invades.
Must Britain's far fam'd glory fall!  Must I,
Forc'd from my antient seat, to barb'rous nations fly!

When lo!  an angel, clad in white, appears,
Sent from th' aetherial mansions of the sky;
Fear not, he cries, your darling Beckford wears
An everlasting crown of light on high.
When his great soul burst from its mounds of clay,
Myriads of angels led it to the realms of endless day.

And know, that Heaven has said, be England free!
Against her, Tyranny shall ne'er prevail;
Tho' clouds awhile her glory may oppose,
The cause of liberty shall never fail:
But awful Justice guard Britannia's laws,
And Wilkes and Townsend be what Beckford was.
