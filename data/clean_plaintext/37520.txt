Here rests his Head upon the Lap of Earth,
One not to Fortune nor to Fame unknown;
Fair Science frown'd not on his humble Birth,
And smooth-tongued Flatt'ry mark'd him for her own.

Large was his Wish &mdash; in this he was sincere,
Fate did a Recompence as largely send,
Gave the poor C&mdash;r Four Hundred Pounds a Year,
And made a d&mdash;y Minister his Friend.

No further seek his Deeds to bring to Light,
For, ah!  he offer'd at Corruption's Shrine;
And basely strove to wash an Ethiop white,
While Truth and Honour bled in ev'ry Line.
