The morrow after just, Saint Georges day,
Grantorto piteous drunke, laie in a ditch,
His handes by's side, his gelding straid away,
His scarlet hose, and doublet very rich,
With mudde and mire all beauty raid, and hy
His feather huge and broad brimm'd hat did ly.

We ask'd the reason of his sitting there,
Zounds cause I am King Solomon (quoth hee)
And in my throne then for the love we beare,
Replied my selfe, unto your Majestie,
Wee'le pull you out, and henceforth wish your grace
Would speak your proverbs in a warmer place.
