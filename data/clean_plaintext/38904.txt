'Twas on the civic feast to be held soon,
Thought warlike Wellington:
Aloft in awful state,
The godlike hero sat,
On his imperial throne.
His sapient peers were placed around,
Their brows with foolscap paper bound,
So should such ministers be crown'd:
The map of London, by his side,
Lay &mdash; like a duteous eastern bride&mdash;
In anxious hope and slavery's pride.
Noble, noble, noble school?
None but the brave,
None but the brave,
None but the brave deserve to rule.

Self-flatt'ry soar'd on high
Above the council board,
And whisper'd to the mighty lord,
Its trembling notes around him fly
And heavenly dreams afford.
The dream began from when
He took a seat above statesmen&mdash;
Such is the power the mighty love;
Sublime o'er common sense he rode,
When he to fair Britannia prest,
And when he sought her free-born breast,
Then far all competition hurl'd,
And made a statesman of himself, a sovereign of the world.
The listening house admire the talents found;
A present deity they shout around;
A present deity the vaulted roofs rebound?
With ravish'd ears
The warrior hears,
Assumes the god,
Affects to nod,
And seems to shake the spheres.

The praise of Beer-halls then the sweet deceiver sang,
Of Beer-halls that from the last session sprang,
The jolly bill in triumph comes,
Sound the trumpets, beat the drums;
Flush'd with a ruddy grace
It shows its honest face:
Now give the hautboys breath; it comes, it comes.
Beer-bills' blessings are a treasure,
Drinking is the soldier's pleasure;
Rich the treasure,
Sweet the pleasure,
Sweet the pleasure after pain.

Sooth'd with the thought the Duke grew vain,
Fought all his battles o'er again,
And thrice he routed all his foes, and thrice he slew the slain.
Self-flatt'ry saw the madness rise,
His glowing cheeks, his ardent eyes,
And, while he heaven and earth defied,
Chang'd the theme, and check'd his pride.
It chose a mournful muse,
Soft pity to infuse;
It sang Napoleon's overthrown
By too severe a fate,
Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,
Fallen from his high estate,
And boastful from his throne.
Deserted at his utmost need
By those his former bounty fed;
On the far rock confin'd he lies,
With not a friend to close his eyes.
With unmov'd looks the hardy victor sat,
Revolving in his steady soul
The various turns of weal and woe,
On the wide map below.

The mighty spirit smil'd to see
Feasting was in the next degree,
'Twas but a kindred thought to wake,
For the map led to a beef-steak.
Softly sweet in Lydian measures,
Soon he sooth'd his soul to pleasures:
War, he sang, was toil and trouble,
Honour but an empty bubble;
Never ending, still beginning,
Fighting still, and still destroying;
If the world be worth the winning,
Think, oh!  think it worth enjoying.
A civic feast is spread beside thee,
Take the goods the gods provide thee;
The many'll rend the skies with loud applause,
And thy police uphold the threatened laws.
The Duke, unable to conceal his pain,
Gazed on the map
In dread of a mishap,
And thought and looked, thought and looked,
Thought and looked, and looked again.
At length with hope and confidence imprest,
The heroic statesman planned the civic feast.

But hark!  to that redoubted knock,
A louder still, and still a louder shock;
Break his flattering dream asunder,
And rouse him like a ranting peal of thunder.
Hark!  hark!  the horrid sound
Has raised up his head;
As awaked from the dead,
And amazed, he stares around.
A letter, a letter, the postman cries&mdash;
See the rabble arise;
See the mob how they rear;
How they hiss in their lair,
And the sparkles that flash from their eyes.
Behold a ghastly band,
How they traverse the Strand:
Those are Freedom's ghosts, that in slumber have lain,
And in false hopes remain,
Trusting to the new reign.
Give the vengeance due
To the Radical crew:
Behold, how they point to the civic abode;
They will slay at its door the warrior lord.
The Home Sec. read the scroll with a terrified glow,
And the King was persuaded the feast to forego.
The Duke led the way
To the House the next day,
And read a kind letter from Alderman Kay.

Thus long ago,
Ere letters could the world o'erthrow,
While aldermen were mute,
Self-flattery had caused to shoot,
Above the soldier's fire,
The thought that he could awe and govern an Empire.
At last the fearful letter came
To check the heroic statesman's flame.
The gentle letter, by its mystic lore,
Replaced the former narrow bounds,
And softly breathed those solemn sounds&mdash;
Back to thy mother wit, from arts unknown before.
Let old self-flattery yield the prize,
Or Kay divide the crown;
It bid a misled hero rise,
He pulled a hero down.
