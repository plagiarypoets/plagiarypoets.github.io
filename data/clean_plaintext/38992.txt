'Twas at a feast, triumphant in the blow
Aim'd basely at Moreau:
In insolence elate
The sullen Consul sate
With Oriental shew:
His swarthy Mamelukes were plac'd around;
Their loins with keen Damascus sabres bound:
(No Frenchman near his person found).
His barren dame, dispelling spleen
By luxury's vain-glorious scene,
Sate by his side a painted quean.
Happy, happy, happy party!
Barras would ne'er
His mistress spare
But to a friend like Bonaparte.

Denon, amidst the croud,
With subtle servile tongue,
His birth and famous exploits sung:
And rais'd the panegyric loud,
Till all the palace rung.
From Moloch rose the tale,
Who left dire Hinnom's distant vale,
'Midst infant shrieks, and mothers' wail;
Stern Attila's dread form the demon took:
O'er Bastia's tow'rs his wings he shook,
Then darting down, his hand he press'd
On Salicetti's wanton breast;
Around her prostituted frame entwin'd,
And stamp'd an image of the Hun, a scourge of all mankind.
The throng adore the monstrous progeny,
The Scourge of God!  the nations round reply.
Proud of the worth
Of such a birth,
He grasps the sword,
He gives the word
Of havoc through the earth.

The praise of Talleyrand, the fawning flatt'rer told;
Of Talleyrand in knavish cunning old;
See the apostate Bishop comes;
Diplomatics!  bite your thumbs.
Devoid of honest grace,
He shews his Jesuit face,
To take the envoy's bribe he smirking comes.
Talleyrand so mean and sly,
Bribes delighteth to retain;
America's possess'd of treasure,
Stealing is the Frenchman's pleasure;
Rich the treasure,
Sweet the pleasure;
Sweet the bribe of Louisiane.

Marking the deed with spiteful smile,
The Consul prais'd his villain's guile;
Resolv'd to seize the prey like European spoil.
The parasite with anxious eyes
Saw avaricious madness rise;
And, startled at his frantic frown,
Chose a theme to bring him down.
For e'en his hireling Muse
A dirge could not refuse
To youthful Bourbon, great and good,
By Rancour's lawless hate,
Hurried, hurried, hurried, hurried,
Hurried from his peaceful gate.&mdash;
Glory of Conde's blood,
Doom'd to insult's bitter pains,
Manacled with galling chains;
Ah!  see he falls, embalm'd he dies,
With patriot tears, with Europe's sighs.
With gloomy looks the sallow tyrant sate,
Remorse had seiz'd his vengeful soul,
Foreboding thoughts his mind engage;
And from his lips some curses stole
Upon his headstrong rage.

Discordant passions urg'd too far,
Thus stirring up intestine war;
His slave to rouse ambition strove,
The pangs of conscience to remove.
With hope of an imperial toy,
Soon he wakens selfish joy.
War with Britain was but trouble;
Invasion a mere empty bubble;
Badly ending, long beginning,
Building those, and they destroying;
If this realm was worth thy winning,
Think its crown is worth enjoying:
See the prize now plac'd beside thee,
Take the crown the Gauls provide thee.
Thy Janizaries shall ensure applause;
And forc'd addresses aid the glorious cause.
The Corsican, so arrogant and vain,
Gaz'd on the crown,
And then look'd down,
And thought and gaz'd, thought and gaz'd,
Thought and gaz'd, and thought again:
Eager at length the diadem to wrest,
He felt an air-drawn dagger at his breast.

Now Adulation's voice again
Had pour'd some fascinating strain;
When spectres fill'd the hall with wonder,
And rous'd the hero like Sir Sidney's thunder.
Hark, hark, at the sound
How he casts down his head;
For with menaces dread
Pale phantoms stalk around.
Revenge, revenge, fierce Toussaint cries,
See brave Kleber arise,
By his order who bled,
When from Egypt he fled,
And his army forsook in disguise.
Behold a ghastly band,
Each a bowl in his hand!
Those are Gallic ghosts that by poison were slain,
And at Jaffa remain
Unburied on the plain.
Give the vengeance due
To the Turkish crew,
Behold how they point to the massacred dead,
And call down horrors on the murd'rer's head.&mdash;
From his palace the despot thus forc'd to retreat,
Embark'd in a fury stout Britons to beat;
Folly led the way,
As though they were his prey,
And, like another Bruys, he lost another fleet.

Thus, long ago,
When Britain warded off a blow,
(Her cannons seldom mute)
Some sycophant his song would suit,
Or flatt'ring lyre,
To charm the court of France, and kindle warlike ire.
At last victorious Nelson came,
Rais'd o'er his foes a matchless name.
The brave enthusiast from his martial stores
Enlarg'd the naval battle's bounds,
And spread abroad triumphant sounds,
By prompt decisive skill, and feats unknown before.
Nelson abroad may gain the prize;
At home we share the crown.
He blew a mortal to the skies,
We sink a demon down.
