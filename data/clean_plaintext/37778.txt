Come, sprightly Goddess, fair and blithe,
With eyes of azure blue,
Who gently skimm'st the fleeting air,
With robe of motley hue;

O!  lull me on the snowy breast
To soft enchanting sleep,
For on thy bosom Care's beguil'd,
And Woe forgets to weep.

Borne on thy wing the cot I've view'd,
The flow'r-enamel'd mead;
Heard Philomela's plaintive moan,
And Shepherd's vocal reed:

The desert wild, the craggy rock,
And dashing surge I've seen,
Th' mould'ring tow'r, and blasted heath,
By Luna's lambent beam.

On Avon's banks I've trac'd the stream,
Where swans divide the wave,
In whose delightful bosom they
Their downy pinions lave.

To Heav'n I oft have wing'd my way,
Where worlds eternal roll,
There trod the spangl'd pavement o'er,
And rov'd from pole to pole.

Come then, thou Goddess, heav'nly fair,
With thee, O!  let me live;
With smiling Mirth let me partake
Those joys which thou can'st give.
