Deare Henries losse, Eliza's wedding day,
The last, the first, I sorrowed and song,
When laid my reedes for evermore away,
To sleep in silence, Isis shades among:
Dead to the Muse, and many-headed throng,
Through hard constraint of fruitlesse Hope compell'd:
And Envie rise, that kills with canckred tongue
The sacred Bay, so honoured of eld,
Though left forlorne, ne now, of Phoebus selfe upheld.

Where are the Summers when the righteous Maid
With ev'nest hand the heavenly Scale did wield,
And golden Deed with golden meed repaid:
When Vertue was in price, for Vertue, held,
When Honours daintie but desert did guild,
And Poesie in graces goodly seene,
Rais'd her high thought, with straines that Nectar still'd?
They are ascended with that glorious Queene:
And she, alas, forgot, as she had never beene.

But dearest daughter of the greatest Ile,
Sole glorious Empresse of the Northren Maine,
Yet thou her glory:  Since thou didst erewhile,
Thy bounteous hand, and sweet supportance daigne
Unto my verse, and all unworthie vaine:
As humblest Iute, by those armes I creep,
That gave me growth, and first my entertaine,
Else lowly buried in Oblivion deep,
Who heere had heard me sing thy sweetest babe a sleep?

And him againe to waken with my song,
Which thousand tunes shall variously divide,
As Vahale by the flowerie bankes along,
I take my pipe at morne and eventide:
Hence may it downe thy gentle bosome glide,
And going on, allay th' enraged Rheine,
Where goodly Nimphes with Muses mild abide:
Who often in his surplusage of Wine,
Doe teach him Temperance, in songs and layes divine.

Now while I shall beside this cradle sing,
Leave Venus Queene atime thy silver spheare,
And to mine aid thy daintie dearling bring,
With Mart appeased after death and dreare:
But from thy pure and peerelesse excellence,
Eliza mother, dreaddest Ladie deere,
Light, life, oh, lend unto mine eine and sence,
For vigor have I none but what I draw from hence.

And Royall childe, who like another Sunne,
From Rosie bed arised'st in the East,
When that great light we saw extinct and done,
Ah Henrie, waild of every gentle brest,
Dart one sweet smile upon me early ghest:
And that my Muse with thine owne heigth may flie,
A feather shed from thy faire Phoenix nest:
So may she teach thy Fame to strike the skie,
And thee a Mirrour make to all Posteritie.
