As musing beside the clear stream
To Twick'nham's gay village ally'd,
Of Nancy I sung, and my theme
Kept pace and complain'd with the tide.

That murmur'd at loss of its POPE&mdash;
I mourn'd for the loss of my FAIR,
As each was like without hope
To meet with a jewel so rare.

Adieu ye sweet meadows and lawns!
No more on your paths shall I stray&mdash;
Or like the brisk lambkins and fawns,
So blithesomely speed the long day!

For Nancy (the cruellest maid!)
Hath left me alone to despair!
Nor heeds the soft things I have said&mdash;
Nay sworn to so oft in her ear.

O fool that I am to complain!&mdash;
Fly, Love!  quickly fly from my breast!&mdash;
Too long have I worn the slave's chain&mdash;
Too long been a stranger to rest!

Since Nancy will not lend an ear,
A nymph that's more kind I'll attend;
But nought of Love' tale shall she hear&mdash;
I'll promise to be her firm Friend.

Methinks I see Venus the gay&mdash;
The little rogue Cupid beside,
Directing an arrow this way,
And, smiling, my maxim deride.

But Venus may boast of her pow'r,
And Cupid contemptuously smile&mdash;
In Friendship I'll spend ev'ry hour&mdash;
No longer shall Love me beguile.

On Friendship grave Reason attends&mdash;
It warms as it grows, and takes root;
And gradually rip'ning, ascends&mdash;
Producing the wholesomest fruit.
