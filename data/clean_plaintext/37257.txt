Thou faintest, lovely daughter of the skies,
Who smilest with thy rolling orbs of light,
Whose face blooms with the rose and lily's dies;
Whose lips of nectar glow like rubies bright,
O'er pearls which sparkle like the dews of night;
Whose snow-white breast with animation glows;
Bound with a zone of purest maiden white:
Whose beauteous tear for wo so softly flows,
It seems like falling dew which bathes the flushing rose:&mdash;

Thou, blooming maid, with thy wild eyes of blue,
Hast kindled in my breast devouring fire,
Which those love-rolling orbs still ever will renew,
While memory's influence shall my mind inspire,
Or till the feelings of my heart expire,
And till it turns to adamantine stone,
Which Love's deep-piercing, cruel darts shall tire,
When pouring on a heart unfeeling grown;
Where arrows cannot pierce, nor music melt with mellow'd tone.

But can the heart turn damp, and hard, and cold,
Where love has plung'd his arrows dire and deep?
No:  sooner will the crucible turn gold
Refin'd and bright, to iron's drossy heap:&mdash;
Sooner will the tender mother cease to weep,
When reft of one lov'd, only, darling child:
The heart can never rest in torpid sleep,
While youthful bloom wakes thrilling passion wild,
And beauty breathes soft words with pleasing accents mild.

Nor can hope smile with heav'n's eternal bloom,
And tell that time shall make the heart grow old;
The damp, cold, rayless night which veils the tomb,
Is all the refuge which can e'er enfold
The tender frame cast in love's magic mould:&mdash;
Then let the howling winds hear my lament,
And rocks and mountains list a tale untold;
I cannot find sweet peace and calm content,
But in the silent grave, where now my steps are bent.

'Tis not that thou art cruel, glowing maid,
For thou hast smil'd upon my mournful-brow;
But thy celestial form in white array'd,
Must bloom for other eyes than those which see thee now;
Thy tender eyes on me must cease to glow;
My boat o'er seas of trouble wide must roam,
O'er rocks and quicksands drag its heavy prow,
Where breakers swell, and rudely fret and foam;
Where beauty's tearless smiles, and ruddy hues must never come.

O!  yet dark rocks, that frown o'er ocean's waves;
Ye forests deep, where towers the lofty pine;
Ye precipices dread, where shady leaves
Smile pendant o'er the raging, roaring brine;&mdash;
In shades of darkest night may I recline
Upon your frowning, solitary steeps;
And may the ivy all around entwine,
Where cypress gloom in midnight horror weeps,
And death's black sentinel the solemn passage keeps!&mdash;

Yet though deep caves should shroud me in their gloom,
And from the world for ever I should fly;
Thou wilt my vital flame of life consume:
I hear, in ev'ry breeze which whistles by,
Sounds like the raven's boding, dismal cry,
Which tell me thou hast firmly fix'd my fate!&mdash;
When those dear charms first met my youthful eye,
Could I then know their influence so great,
That I should leave so soon my tale for others to relate.

Smile on, O mild, endearing, sweetest girl,
In innocence so sprightly, fair and gay;
Soft auburn locks around thy features curl,
And while with raptur'd glance I now survey
Thy seraph eyes celestial blue display,
I know that thou shalt be more blest than I;
Thy breast shall glow with love's warm, melting ray;
Some tender heart thy beauties shall descry,
Which thine shall own with dear delight, and weeping eye.

And may your joy and blissful rapture last,
And light you down the lovely vale of years;
But me not destin'd these delights to taste,
My crimson blood shall soon turn all to tears;
For thou art all which life to me endears,
And when from thee I shall be rudely torn,
The damp grave shall conceal my hopes and fears:&mdash;
No more shall I be left for thee to mourn,
But peaceful, calmly sleep, no longer weeping, sad, forlorn.
