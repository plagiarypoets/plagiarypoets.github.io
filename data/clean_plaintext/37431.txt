Now from the bed, where Morpheus, gentle God,
Drew round my shaded eyes his curtain soft,
Full early let me spring,
And offer up with thanks
The fervent incense of a grateful heart,
To him who sees the secrets of my breast.
Then let me roam a-field
And climb the eastern hill,
Where Health awaits me, walking to and fro,
With looks of joy &mdash; And  See!  she waves her wand:
I come with chearful soul,
O Mountain Nymph, I come.
Thanks to thee, Goddess.  Thou hast touch'd my cheek,
And substituted a carnation there,
Which once was sicklied o'er
With hue, as primrose, pale:
But now it glows with animated warmth,
'Till by degrees it blushes to a rose.
As yet 'tis silence all,
Save where Aurora's bird
Awakes the slumb'ring peasant to his toil,
And bids good-morrow to the rising sun.
The rising sun puts on
His dazzling robe of gold,
And from caelestical chamber issuing forth,
Comes clad in glory, dancing all abroad.
Before him fly the clouds,
Astonish'd at his pow'r,
And from the bosom of the smiling mead,
Ascend the vapours.  Then the rivers curl,
And all their borders shine
Beneath his glowing orb.
Now spangled o'er with drops of chrystal dew,
Shines ev'ry tree-top, ev'ry verdant bush:
Now springs the herald lark,
And flutters up the air,
Proclaims with gladness the return of light,
And calls up all his fellows of the wing.
His fellows of the wing
Awake, and join the song,
From warbling Linnet, and melodious Thrush,
Down to the Sparrow chirping on the spray,
Down to the twitling Finch,
And emulative Wren.
But hark!  the Farmers whistle to their teams,
And yelping curs disturb Attention's ear.
The multitude are up,
And noisy hurry reigns.
The sons of Labour play their restless tools.
One undistinguishable sound prevails,
And scorching Phoebus flames
Intolerable day.
Sweet Morn, adieu!  farewel thine early kiss,
Thy pleasing, odif'rous gales farewel!
'Till once more I have paid
My mattins to my God.
