Nought is there, under Heaven's wide hollowness,
That moves more dear compassion of mind,
Than Beauty brought to' unworthy wretchedness
Thro' Envy's snares, or Fortune's freaks unkind:
I, whether lately thro' her brightness blind,
Or thro' allegiance and fast fealty,
Which I do owe unto all Womankind,
Feel my heart pierc'd with so great agony,
When such I see, that all for pity I could die!

And now it is empassioned so deep,
For fairest Una's sake, of whom I sing,
That my frail eyes these lines with tears do steep;
To think how she, thro' guileful handeling,
Tho' true as touch, tho' daughter of a King,
Tho' fair as ever living wight was fair,
Tho' nor in word nor deed ill meriting,
Is from her Knight divorced in despair,
And her due loves deriv'd to that vile Witch's share.
