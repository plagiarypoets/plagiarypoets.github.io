We both are lovers of the poets old!
But Milton hath your heart, &mdash; and Spenser mine;&mdash;
So let us love them: &mdash;  you, the song divine,&mdash;
And I, the tale of times gallant and bold.
Be it yours to dream in Paradise, &mdash; behold
The tresses of fair Eve roll down, and shine
Over her bending neck in streams of gold;
While her white hands the struggling roses twine
Up the green bowers of Eden. &mdash; Mine be it to look
At the romantic land of Faery!
See Una sit under a shady tree,
And troops of satyrs near a wooded brook,
All dancing in a round; &mdash; and dimly see,
In arbour green, Sylvanus, lying drowsily.
