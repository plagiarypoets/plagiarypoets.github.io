Yet for that I prefer your well known good wils afore any vayne feare, take this with the rest if they be any, with such favor, as if I were by you at the Reading.

A mio solemente amandona [     ] Madonna:  Donna non parelin.
L'Angelico sembiante e quel vel volte.
Fal' odio, e l'ira vain oblivione,
Ch'a l' &amp;c.

Angellike semblaunce, beauties ornament.
Whose Vertue quels all wrath and rancor deepe,
Whose life heavens grace and death would monument
Vertue they life are.  [     ]
How many wounded hearts thou makst to tremble,
And I of many one cannot dissemble,
How farre into in [     ] that eie-sore.

So were thy beauty but deserving prayse,
So were thy beauty but as feminine,
Then could my quill his straine so high arraise,
Then could with it compare the masculine,
Thy beauty praise thy bounty spast divine,
No straine no quil such wonderments assaies,
Then Poets penne shal to thy power his power resigne.

What words may wel expresse such excellence,
No humane thought thy beauties may comprise
And wordes may tel al humane insolence
Al humane wordes and witte thy gifts surprize.
To satisfie my selfe in my pretence,
Our pen unto the heavens must wander hence.
And fil it selfe with heavenly dew of Sapience.

And I my life shal to your hands resigne,
Which life to serve a humane Saint so past divine.

Se da colei,
Che poco ingegno adhor adhormi lima.

This Sonnet was ended with as much prayse as it began with desire, and one of them coppyed it out, and so it was made common to the rest, and made a good sorte of them Poets, testifying these grosse conceits, with so sweete a matter.
