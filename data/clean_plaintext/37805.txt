Reader!: &mdash; No song of chivalry is here&mdash;
No deep wrought fiction rich with fabled woe:&mdash;
But oh, if virtue to thy soul be dear&mdash;
And thy young heart can feel affection's glow
Then come thou here! &mdash; Thy tears with mine shall flow&mdash;
For I have heard a tale thy heart will wring&mdash;
And I have seen as fair a flower laid low
As Zephyr ever fanned with dewy wing&mdash;
And woe is me, that mine the task should be
To tell of woman's love, and man's INCONSTANCY!&mdash;
