When our first father thro' the dreary waste,
From Eden's plains an exile sad must go,
Oft he recall'd each scene of pleasure past,
Felt the dire change, and bid his sorrows flow.
Yet still a soft companion of his woe,
With sweet assiduous care attended near;
Fond to relieve, and resolute to shew
The soothing smile, or sympathyzing tear.
Far heavier doom, alas!  attends me here,
Who leave, of nymphs so fair, a train behind;
Nor one is found the tedious way to chear,
Or raise, with converse sweet, the drooping mind.
Then tell me, fair ones, can I chuse but grieve,
Who quit this Paradise, without an Eve.
