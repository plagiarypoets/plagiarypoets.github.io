Spenser can the Encomium of thy skill,
Flow through the slender channel of a Quill.
Can Mortalls speake thy verses goodness, when
They strike the praise of silence into men.
Fountaine of Fancy, whose mellifluous streame
Flotes in applause the dresse of every theme.
Purgeth obscurely, and does impart
To every line the Harmony of Art.
It makes (since murmers be with musick meete)
Thy Muse to dance on her Poetick feete
She leads the rest and when their strength is past
She can cut capers in a verse at last
'Tis not immodest, lest he sprightly rise
She'l reach the Lawrel from the lofty skies.
