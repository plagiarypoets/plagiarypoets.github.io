No airy dreams their simple fancies fir'd,
No thirst for wealth, nor panting after fame,
But truth divine sublimer hopes inspir'd,
And lured them onward to a nobler aim.

From every cottage with the day arose
The hallowed voice of spirit-breathing prayer;
And artless anthems, at its peaceful close,
Like holy incense, charmed the evening air.

Though they, each tome of human lore unknown,
The brilliant path of science never trod,
That sacred volume claimed their hearts alone,
Which points the way to glory and to God.

Here they from truth's eternal fountain drew,
The pure and gladdening waters day by day;
Learned, since our days are evil, fleet and few,
To walk in wisdom's bright and peaceful way.

In yon lone pile o'er which hath sternly passed
The heavy hand of all-destroying time,
Through whose low mouldering aisles now sighs the blast,
And round whose altars grass and ivy climb:

They gladly thronged, their grateful hymns to raise,
Oft as the calm and holy Sabbath shone;
The mingled tribute of their prayers and praise,
In sweet communion rose before the throne.

Here from those honoured lips which sacred fire
From Heaven's high chancery hath touched, they hear
Truths which their zeal inflame, their hopes inspire,
Give wings to faith, and check affliction's tear.

When life flowed by, and, like an angel, Death
Came to release them to the world on high,
Praise trembled still on each expiring breath,
And holy triumph beamed from every eye.

Then gentle hands their "dust to dust" consign,
With quiet tears the simple rites are said,
And here they sleep, till at the trump divine,
The earth and ocean render up their dead.
