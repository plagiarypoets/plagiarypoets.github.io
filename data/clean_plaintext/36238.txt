And hast thou bidden to thy harp farewell?
O thou, on whom divine Cecilia smil'd,
Who wrapt thine infant slumbers in her spell,
And claim'd thee from thy dawn her fav'rite child;
Say, wherefore hast thou now thy harp exil'd?
Shiver'd its chords, &mdash; in deep neglect now lying,&mdash;
Thou who so well could'st wake its 'witch notes wild!
Now murmuring deep &mdash; to plaintive airs now sighing;
Now sprightly o'er its strings thy rosy fingers flying.

Yet tho' by thee to cold neglect consign'd,
On the glad ear no more its music stream,
Still lives the dear remembrance in the mind;
Its ling'ring echoes to my fancy seem
Like the faint image of a lovely dream,
Lighting up mem'ry with a parting ray:
Thus oft is view'd the midly-chasten'd beam
Thro' storied panes, when western splendors play,
With more increas'd delight than the broad glare of day.

Its fate like a discarded lover's is;
It shared thy admiration for a while;
So he awhile, enwrapt in fancied bliss,
Basks in the heaven of his lady's smile;
But ah!  its shines on him but to beguile!
Another lover fills her roving eye,
Then recks she naught her former to exile;
For this new flame she mocks at oath's dread tie&mdash;
Hearts hard as adamant in coquettes' bosoms lie.

Why one so fair, so young, should throw aside
Her tuneful harp, in sooth, 'tis hard to tell:
O!  it could spring not from mistaken pride,
Ah no!  bright excellence!  I ween full well
In thy fair bosom envy may not dwell.
Resume, dear maid, thy once-lov'd lyre resume!
Breathe thro' its chords thy soul-enchanting spell;
Seize, seize the time, while youth is in its  bloom,
No mirth in palsied age, &mdash; no music in the tomb.
