Weave the woof, and o'er the warp,
Pour the many twinkling harp:
Near Aetolias radiant bower,
Let the tuneful plummage lower,
Such the insatiate poet's doom!

Night comes on, with moon-crown'd lustre,
Binds the stars in faded cluster;
Careless on some dusky river,
Cupids ever-rattling quiver,
Shuttles of a vengeful loom.

Still the Thracian spectre's car
Wages red a barbarous cry,
Thro' the fervent groves of war
Where her pointed triumphs die,
Peace, ye heart-repelling fair,
Lave in burnish'd tints your hair.

Peace, O peace, mellifluous glory
'Midst the forests browner roar,
Hail each mute enamour'd story;
Hail each withering flame of Yore.
He spoke and wanton to the rugged beam,
With lambent robes, he swept the horror of the stream.
