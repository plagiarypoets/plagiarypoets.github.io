Form'd to restore, with Judgment's steady hand,
A better image of thy Master's law
Than the false glare of cold Corruption's brand
Permits her hood-wink'd sycophants to draw
Thy spirit, Watson, the dark shadows saw
Which greedy Priesthood scatters o'er his shrine,
The whiles swoln Luxury feasts her filthy maw,
Sinking to earth the precious spark divine.
Mourning to see obstructed Genius pine
In the damp mists of Penury's chill night
Fell thy strong blow with well-resolv'd design
To break the veil from Scrutiny's clear light.
Blest work!  which, spite of sneaking Avarice' blame,
And Power's rough arm, shall blaze thro' endless time thy name.
