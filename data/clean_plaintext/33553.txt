Spencer the next, whom I doe thinke't no shame
To imitate, if now his worke affords
So vast a glory.  O!  how faire a fame
Had he not doated on exploded words,
Had waited on him; let his honoured name
Find veneration 'bove the earths great lords,
Great Prince of Poets, thou canst never die
Lodg'd in thy rare immortal history!

Immortal Mirrour of all poesie
Spirit of Orpheus, bring your precious balms:
Gof of invention, to thy memory
Wee'l offer incense, singing hymns and psalms.
Joy to our laurell, Joves deare Mercury,
Ingyrt his grave with myrtle and with palms,
Whose rare desert first kindled my desire,
And gave me confidence thus to aspire.
