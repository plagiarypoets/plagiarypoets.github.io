When first the infant left the Saxon shore
Rude was her voice and homely her array,
Till Chaucer to the wanton court her bore,
Where jests and wiles she learned and amorous play.
Then Spenser's cell the damsel did explore,
Who decked her locks with Latian flowrets gay;
And taught to chaunt the visionary lay,
With Fancy's treasures fraught and Wisdom's lore.
What dreams of transport soothed her youthful breast
When Shakespear led her to the impassioned scene!
She hoped no more:  till in her Milton blest,
Who strength and beauty gave her to convene,
In heavenly arms and heavenly splendor drest,
She rose a cherub thro' the blue serene.
