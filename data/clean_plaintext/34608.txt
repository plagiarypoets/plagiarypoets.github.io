Blessings on heavn's high king!  His word divine,
Which spoke chaotic darkness into light,
Great GEORGE'S mind to virtue's fairer shrine
Obedient call'd, and glory's arduous height:
His fost'ring care, beneath a distant sky,
A beauteous Virgin's purest soul refin'd,
Whose native worth with GEORGE'S own might vie,
A softer image of his manly mind:
Through ages then his blessings to convey,
He gave a royal babe to Albion and to Day.

In that blest morn bright Virtue's hallow'd band
Gan jocund strains of melody to pour,
While Science, fix'd of thought, of ready hand,
With choicest honours mark'd the happy hour:
Religion, decent maid with silver zone,
Shot beams of chastest joy from either eye,
And Liberty, best guardian of the throne,
Exultant rais'd her cherub voice on high:
Meanwhile enrag'd Oppression gnaw'd his chain,
And Faction mourn'd for ever lost her revel reign.

And lo!  with hasten'd step and pleasing mein
Fair Peace returns, with all her exile train,
To greet this infant prince; while heav'n's high queen,
Wisdom yclep'd, by whom earth's monarchs reign,
Her purpose speaks; the devious paths of youth
Beside, his ductile soul secure to lead
Thro' arduous ways of valour, justice, truth,
Up Science hill to virtue's noblest meed:
His bosom rouse to deeds of high emprize,
And now its youthful ardor praise, and now chastize.

Thus form'd, Britannia's younger son shall tell
By deeds of high renown his royal birth,
While in his self-approving breast shall dwell
Confess'd his either parent's peerless worth.
So some fair scyon, rich in gen'rous blood
Of parent-stem, in wisely-chosen hour
Transplanted, and improv'd by genuine food
Of quick'ning heat, and vegetating show'r,
In earth's dank bosom strikes its fertile root,
And speaks its goodly origin by kindred fruit.

Then when, mature in age, by heav'n's decree,
He takes the sceptre from his parent's hand,
Like him shall rule, by laws benign as free,
The prince and patron of a grateful land;
Like him, behold a manly offspring rise
Proclaim'd by deeds of kindred worth his own,
Then, full of years, affect his native skies;
Pleas'd in fair thought to new his righteous throne
Thro' latest ages in his line descend,
Nor Brunswic ever but with time and Britain end.
