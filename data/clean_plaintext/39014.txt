Thy will be done, O King of Kings!
On Albion's banners sorrows wait,
Tho' fann'd by victory's glorious wings,
They wave in melancholy state!
Youth's bright helm, nor virtue's mail,
In thy dread visitations, can avail
To call a Seraph back from Heavenly spheres&mdash;
Not Albion's prayers &mdash; not Albion's tears!
Thus flow the strains, that o'er the rising pride
Of England's Prince spread sorrow and dismay;
As up the steep of power and empire wide,
He winds with filial awe his bright array;
Lo!  Clarence tranc'd in speechless grief appears,
York drops his glittering lance, dissolv'd in generous tears!
