When late in Delia's arms I lay,
When late I listen'd to her syren tongue,
And blam'd the hours that stole so fast away,
Prolong'd the kiss while round her neck I clung.
Nor mark'd the gathering cloud that o'er us hung.
Nor saw the rocks 'gainst which our barks was driven,
Nor dreamt of female friendship thus unstrung,
Nor one slight fault could never be forgiven.
So have I seen the sun retire at even,
While glowing tints pourtray'd the western sky;
At morn dark clouds obscured the face of Heaven,
And veil'd the radiant orb from mortal eye.
The storm subsides, the black'ning clouds retire,
Fair looks the sky, far hence be Delia's ire.
