Roving where love and contemplation stray,
Ideal vision drew the sacred Nine;
As on their all mellifluous lyres they play,
And O!  methought they breath'd a lay like thine,
Such was its melting sound, "and energy divine!"

Methought they sung the song of soft complaint,
Alas!  they cried, Insipience strikes the string;
Each Briton's voice, alas!  how poor, how faint,
In what an apathetic strain they sing,
The renovated health of Albion's glorious King!

With boundless rapture bid the power inspire,
The blooming Falconer's pathetick mind:
Let every Muse transfuse the Heav'nly fire,
And round her brow the living laurel bind,
T' astonish and to awe too arrogant mankind.

Calliope the blooming wreath shall bear;
And bathe her temples from the Muse's spring;
Shield her soft breast from ev'ry female fear,
And bid her mount on Fancy's vent'rous wing,
The vast empyreal heights where few have dar'd to sing!

The substance this; for I but faintly caught
The sounds the Falconer soars aloof to hear:
My nerveless note Heavenly Muse has taught,
To shrill the soul, or chain the raptur'd ear,
While Nature drops the fond, the proud extatick tear!
