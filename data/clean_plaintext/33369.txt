I hearde the mountaine gods complaine,
Sweet Willy thou neglects thy straine,
And that thou wouldst not blesse againe
Thy fellow swaine.

The sisters did bewaile,
That hee whose notes did oft assaile
Apollos skill, yea did prevaile,
Their art disdaines.

What if some forward stub-chind boy
Takes upp a reed, and dos employ
His artlesse lipps, can this annoy
Thy sweeter song?

Could thy exactnesse brooke a foile,
Without disparagement; their soile
Commends thy tounge more smoothe than oile,
Our sports amonge.

Great Pan eer since thou wentst away,
Has mist the glories of his day,
No shepheard dares begin a lay
To honor him.

Behold how all our joyes do turne
To sadnesse, see hot sighs which burne
Our brests, look how our swolne eyes mourne
And weepe till drie.

Our crooks are trailed along the ground,
Our pipes grow dumb, or sadly sound,
No flowrie chaplets eer hath crownd,
Since thine a browe.

Each shepheardesse as in despaire,
Mean more to be proclaimed faire,
T' fitt time to trim her fluent haire
Doth scarce allow.

Our lambs doe leave to skipp about,
And ape their dames sad pace throughout,
The hills with woes, as if they doubt
Securitie.

Now thou art absent, whose smooth reed
Did in the woulfs and tigers breed
A nature tame, and thus them freed
From crueltie.

Each muse, godd, sheep, and shepheards all,
Joyn in the art thy madrigall,
For Pans sake at thy festivall
Renew thy straines.

Why should that spright which sored so hie
Above the ken of emulous eye,
Eer Doridon be finishd die,
And shun our playnes.
