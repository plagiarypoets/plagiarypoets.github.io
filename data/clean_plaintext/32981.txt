What it is to breathe and live without life:
How to be pale with anguish, red with feare,
T' have peace abroad, and nought within but strife:
Wish to be present, and yet shun t' appeare:
How to be bold far off, and bashfull neare:
How to think much, and have no words to speake:
To crave redresse, yet hold affliction deare:
To have affection strong, a body weake:
Never to finde, and evermore to seeke:
And seeke that which I dare not hope to finde:
T' affect this life, and yet this life disleeke:
Gratefull t' another, to my selfe unkinde.
This cruell knowledge of these contraries,
DELIA my hart hath learnd out of those eies.
