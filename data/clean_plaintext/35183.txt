May never more of pensive melancholy
Within my heart, beneath thy roof appear,
Than just to break the charm of idle folly,
And prompt for other's woes the melting tear;
No more than just that tender gloom to spread
Where thy beloved Muses wont to stray,
To lift the thought from this low earthly bed,
Or bid hope languish for a brighter day;
And deeper sink within thy feeling heart
Love's pleasing wounds, or friendships polished dart!
