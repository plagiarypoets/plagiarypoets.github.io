GILES.
Zooks, brother James, you still maintain your ground;
I deemed you feeble, but I find you sound.

JAMES.
Brother, as hale as ever, and as strong;
And proof against your virulence of tongue.

GILES.
So much the worse; I'm tired of filth and dirt,
And (not to mention lace) would like a shirt.
Each dog should have his day and then resign;
You've had your turn, and now, methinks, 'tis mine.

LUKE.
And why am I forgot?  my chains I hate
Like any Patriot; and could break a pate,
As well; or sweat a speech, or force a gate.

JAMES.
Excuse me, brothers; pardon me, if I
Prefer clean shirts to straw and beggary.
One half the subjects men contest about
Lie in a nutshell; thus, if in, or out.
But waving such defence; if you can show
By any reas'ning, save a knock-down blow,
Fair claim to share my purse and my effects,
I'll hear again your budget of pretexts.

GILES.
I hate a night cellar&mdash;

LUKE.
And I a cell&mdash;

GILES.
Very well;
Then let me ask, why I must moil and labour,
While downy cushions prop my lazy neighbour?
Why I must kick my heels against the stones,
While chariots soothe Right Honourable bones?

JAMES.
Ask, rather, why the fowls of Heav'n fly,
Or fish swim?  It is their destiny.

GILES.
But all mankind are equal from their birth.

JAMES.
Aye!  if you mean, in origin from Earth.
But if you mean in talent, spirit, mind,
Your argument is lighter than the wind.

GILES.
No; but I mean in title to possess
The goods of Earth; the greater, as the less.

JAMES.
How long would that equality remain?
All things would shortly gravitate again.
As light or dense, if dry or moist subside,
When fused together, and their posts divide,
Or like those toys, whose base is sway'd by lead,
Which right themselves when placed upon their head.
Would it exist, I ask, above an hour?
Superior knowledge is superior pow'r,
And rules the weaker mind by nat'ral right,
Sure to be victor in the mental fight;
Sure as the swiftest coursers in the race,
Will distance each competitor in pace;
Though all are equal at the starting place,
So that you war with nature; and you try
To introduce worse inequality;
By taking from the swift the victry's meed,
And granting prizes to the slow in speed.

GILES.
What!  has each dropsied purse by toil been won?

JAMES.
Yes; it concerns not if by sire or son.
And try, whene'er you choose, a fresh career,
Wealth, pow'r, rank, all would re-appear?
The only change would be, that I and you
Would barter dwellings.&mdash;

GILES.
And suppose we do!
That to be plain's the very thing we want;
A King's a King; and Lords are Lords you'll grant.

JAMES.
Aye; but your Kings and Lords will be the same,
In nothing, after all your pains, but name.
At all events; if some rule there must be,
And some is needful, as you all agree,
'Tis better to be ruled by Gentlemen,
Check'd by law, custom, feeling, and the pen,
Than mobs who follow, as the passions draw,
Who feel not censure, and who hate the law,
On whom no social courtesies prevail,
With half so strong a reas'ning as a gaol,
To whom or black or white appear alike,
As colours fall the blind men's eye to strike,
'Tis not his fault, I grant ye, but his doom,
Yet, let him not to see and guide presume.

GILES.
Enjoyment should be equal.

LUKE.
So say I.

JAMES.
But that it can be equal, I deny;
Men are not equal in capacity.
One man eats more than half a dozen guests;
Anothers weaker organ scarce digests.
So the construction of the human mind&mdash;
One is as much superior to his kind,
As they to brutes; and not by drill, or rules;
No; nor the purblind discipline of schools;
(For then the birch might render all the same)
But mere texture of th' organic frame
Which none can give, but HE from whence it came.

GILES.
You mean, of course, the gift was not our lot?

JAMES.
I say not so; it may be &mdash; or may not.
If many a mental pearl lie unreveal'd,
Perhaps 'tis better that it be conceal'd;
The cock who found a jewel at his feet,
Had freely chang'd it for a grain of wheat;
But minds there are of such a stubborn grain,
As render polish and exertion vain;
So much for natural equality.

GILES.
Your reas'ning, brother, does not here apply;
Such mental joys I want not; nay, I hate.

JAMES.
What then?

GILES.
My Sunday beer and broken pate.

LUKE.
And I, to run a muck at all I meet,
Or chalk my poetry from street to street.

JAMES.
Why then complain of this?  Empurpled beds
Would add no richer rest to broken heads.
Volumes are lost to him that cannot read,
As spurs are useless to a foundered steed.
Gin&mdash;

GILES.
Well, Sir, drinking that I hope's no sin.

JAMES.
No matter; drank from rubies, 'tis but Gin.

GILES.
What do you mean?

JAMES.
I mean, that outward state
By no means proves ameliorated fate.

GILES.
Better live gorged, than spare.

JAMES.
I do'nt know that;
Dire are the penalties of sloth and fat.
O'er loaded boards, her venom Luxury flings,
Nor spares, in turn, or Commoners, or Kings.
Gout lurks beneath the high-spiced fricassee,
And dropsy ambush'd lies in Cote Roti;
Bile dips his shafts in truffles and poix-rames,
And nightmare, couch'd in turtle, waits her prey.

GILES.
Good!  then you think best to diet spare.

LUKE.
And after stripes for breakfast, dine on air.
A treat I often owe to zealous care.

JAMES.
No; what I mean to say is, simply this;
There's a mark'd balance in our share of bliss:
Life, without fear or hope's an awful load;
Say, which is best, the cantery or the goad?
Flesh that endures some punctures of the sense,
Or spirit, canker-knawed, by indolence:
Say; for profounder heads might fluctuate,
Between the sated or the craving state;
Between abundance, wanting power to eat,
And hunger, toil-produced, but spare of meat.
The constitution&mdash;

GILES.
Is not sound, Sir.

LUKE.
Good!
What say ye to a gentle loss of blood?

GILES.
Or strong cathartic?

JAMES.
Misbegotten elves!
Are ye the doctors free from taint yourselves?
At least the man who undertakes a cure,
From some infection, should himself be pure.

GILES.
Why so we are;

LUKE.
And now I'm on the strain,
Why, Sir, is voice denied to the insane?

GILES.
True:  all who have a voice should have a vote.

JAMES.
Yes:  if good sense depended on the throat;
If that were measured out to all, like voice.
But, if I err not, what you want's a choice
Assembly; cull'd from all the good and wise,
"To read their history in a nation's eyes;"
A subtle extract from the grosser frame,
Not quantity but quality the aim:
As the pure spirits are exern'd from blood,
And life-supporting chyle's derived from food.
For 'tis not greater bulk gives more of brain,
Else justly might the animals complain;
Else justly might the limbs and arms rebel,
Depose the head, and hope to rule as well.
Nor does the thinking organ's magnitude
Prove that the texture and the matter's good.
Else might the dull majority think fit,
To sit in conclave, and remodel wit.
The greater mass of men were never made,
To speak their counsel, but pursue their trade,
And well the sage has put the query; how,
Can he advise, whose talk is of the plough
And bullocks?  Say, did ever fool presume,
From mingled weeds and flow'rs to still perfume?
A dandelion's not a violet,
Nor will a popy scent like mignionette.
Just such a folly is the new pretence
To take the universal public sense;
The larger extract must o'erpower the less
And mind be lost amidst the rank excess.

GILES.
But; still I've got an argument in store.

LUKE.
And if that fails, I'll back you with a score.

GILES.
Grant, that the fact may be as you have said,
Our chief deficiency is want of head;

LUKE.
No, gold, sir; we've enough of brass and lead.

GILES.
Yet sure I am that many a genius dwells
In loftiest garret;&mdash;

LUKE.
Aye; and lowliest cells.

GILES.
That I can boast amid my patriot train,
Great men, who have not learn'd to spell in vain,
Who've to the name of "Magna Charta" pat;
And "Universal Suffrage," and &mdash; all that;
And tell of Parliaments so pure of yore,
When towns were made of pledges; or before.
Why should not all this Information share,
And suck in knowledge as they gulp down air?

JAMES.
I see no bar; but grant amidst your crew,
Many a first-rate genius lies perdu:
Let me propound this question; What's your aim?
More happiness is't not?

GILES.
The same.

LUKE.
The same.

JAMES.
By you, then, must th' hypothesis be proved,
If Joy be quickened; and the mind is moved?
A Question, much like this, if lashes please;
Or whether fever be a state of ease.
Expose the naked nerve to cold and wind&mdash;
Each contact galls it; so the excited mind,
Finds with its keener sense, its evils grow,
And each refinement but an added woe.

GILES.
Then you affirm that "ignorance is bliss;"

LUKE.
A hit by Neptune!

JAMES.
Not precisely this;
No need to overdrive the argument
When the point aim'd at is of short extent.
But ask the bay-crown'd Lord, and let him tell
What joys, with fired imagination dwell,
That flame unquench'd which turns a heav'n to hell;
That brain-sick, morbid, languishing disease,
Fed by the prurient joys that promise ease!
He (wo'd by fortune), through mere wantonness,
Coquettes with sorrow, and puts on distress,
As some young widow does her mourning dress.
Next ask the ploughman, if increase of light
Has brought one added comfort, one delight;
He, who of old, has occupation o'er,
Till'd the small garden at his cottage door;
But now, grown wise, harangues on "Spence's Plan,"
At the next pot-house; and "The Rights of Man."
Fir'd by the growing zeal to speechify,
Which menaces vast logocracy;
Which, instant, timed or ill-timed, right or wrong,
Is called on after dinner, like a song.
All states possess their pleasures and their cares:
Yours have been stated; thinking men have theirs.
Why scan the task, imposed on us by fate?
All cannot affluent be, nor all be great:
Nor is to wealth, to power, to wisdom giv'n,
A happier province by presiding Heav'n.
'Tis not fine clothes, the better actor tell;
But all can act the part assign'd them well.
So common sense affirms.

GILES.
I care not, I.
Grant me but one experiment to try.

LUKE.
Nor I; let those who like by reason sway,
Grant me a naked sword, and then &mdash; fair play.

BOTH.
Just for a little while your seat resign.

JAMES.
No, Brothers, not for your sakes; nor for mine.
Both would play equal freaks; if both were free,
And both destroy yourselves, as well as me.
