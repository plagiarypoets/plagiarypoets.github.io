O could I waft my heart's sincerest wish
Over the dark blue waters of the sea!
Life's purest springs of happiness would gush
With overflowing fountains upon thee;
Thy cloudless mind, from care and sorrow free,
Should bask in young love's purest, sunniest rays,
In thy heart's dearest sweet society
Would pass in pleasure all thy coming days,
Amidst the woods and streams of thy dear native braes.

And dreams of youth would all be realis'd;
Thy early choice should be thy country's pride;
Thy songs of love, by youths and maidens priz'd.
Should gain him fame, and thou shouldst be his bride.
His sweet poetic maiden by his side,
With beating heart should hear her love's renown,
And wreaths of brightest poetry be tied
By her young minstrel, midst the ringlets brown,
That slept upon his breast, and shared his laurel crown.
