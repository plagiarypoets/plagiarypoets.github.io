Here lacks an Angel's Tongue to Trumpet forth,
In his best Layes, blest Paradise's worth;
That by those sweet straines he a tast might give
To you, what pleasures there for ever Live.
Here lacks a Tasso, or a Bartas, or
A Spencer's Muse, a Quarles, or Silvester:
Or some such Laureate:  But since their skil
Is wanting to my Pen, accept my Will:
For though my Muse cann't reach their lofty vein,
Child-like the Truth speaks in a stammering strain.
Thus far sh' has waded, and she th'rough must go,
Although the style is for the Theame too low. . . .
