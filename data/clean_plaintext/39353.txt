Since Daphne will hear me complain,
No longer my sorrows I'll hide;
But, Oh!  how unwelcome the strain,
Which tells us that Florimel dy'd.
She dy'd!  but Oh!  why was it mine
The sorrowful tale to relate?
But tho' 'twere a fault to repine,
Allow me to mourn at her fate.

So young to be snatch'd from our arms!
Ere nature perfection had wrought;
But tho' we're depriv'd of her charms,
Her virtues can ne'er be forgot.
Oh!  Death too relentless to spare
In Florimel all that could please;
In Florimel all that was dear,
And 'reft us of comfort and ease.

But hence let me haste to the grove,
And there strive to solace my grief;
Since pastimes no pleasure can prove,
And mirth can afford no relief;
Then yearly when maids shall attend,
Oh!  be it with sorrow exprest,
That, once the gay hope of each friend,
Now silently sleeps in the dust.
