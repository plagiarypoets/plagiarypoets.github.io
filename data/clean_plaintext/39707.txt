The muse unwilling leaves the sacred shore
Where every virtue held its peaceful reign;&mdash;
Hangs with regret on scenes she lov'd before,
The last sad wanderer from the pensive plain.

She views where once the sons of freedom stray'd,
Whose hard misfortunes claim the sigh sincere;
She saw fair Genius fly his native shade,
And dropt the panting tribute of a tear.&mdash;

But why, sweet maid, so fondly dost thou cling
To rugged rocks where no soft verdure grows;
While climes more grateful court the tuneful string,
And point to vales of pleasure and repose?

Haply thou lov'st to ease th' afflicting smart
That tears the breast by misery doom'd to mourn,
To gild the gloom around the victim's heart,
Or bend, with pity, o'er the patriot's urn.

Or, haply where beneath the iron hand
Of stern oppression, youth's fair flow'rets fade,
Kindly with sympathy's endearing hand
And bright-eyed hope, thou cheer'st the dungeon's shade.

For him who warm'd by freedom's genial fire,
With soul unfetter'd drags the despot's chain,
Perhaps thy hand attunes the living lyre,
To soothe his woes by music's magic strain.

And thou, gay Fancy, bless his languid hours,
Each flattering phantom let thy care bestow,
To strew his lonely path with fairy flowers,
And pluck the noxious nettles as they grow.&mdash;

Say, and ye powers of Truth, accordant join!
The time shall come &mdash; that Fate has fix'd the doom&mdash;
The friends of suffering Virtue shall combine
And hurl each blood-stain'd tyrant to the tomb.
