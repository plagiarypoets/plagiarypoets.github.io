There is a charm in friendship's sacred flame,
A soft endearment in its pleasing smiles,
That shoots extatic feeling through the frame,
And makes this earth a heaven.  It beguiles
The frowns of fate, and life's annoying broils;
Bedecks our chequer'd path with fragrant flowers;
Plays, like a sun-beam, on our many toils;
Gives brighter shades to bliss; wings the dull hours;
Dispels the cloud of sorrow when it threat'ning low'rs.

These were the gifts your friendship made to me,
Th' ingenuous tribute of your faithful heart.
These did I dream mine 'till eternity&mdash;
But, like a dream they're vanish'd, and I part
Divided, &mdash; torn with many a madd'ning smart,
From **** shores where first our friendship grew.
Perhaps, when absent, you may yet impart
One kind remembrance, though ne'er more to view
Him in whose breast a heart beat, and will beat for you.

Receive than here, a long &mdash; my last farewell!
And with it, too, they force their ways, these tears!
My bosom's feelings all I cannot quell&mdash;
I cannot hush all sorrows.  Future years
Seem dark as chaos.  Endless doubts and fears
Present themselves wher'er my eyes I cast.
And then the past in beauteous rays appears,
Like a bright star amidst the tempest's blast,
And gives an edge.  But, oh!  farewell!  We part &mdash; all's past!
