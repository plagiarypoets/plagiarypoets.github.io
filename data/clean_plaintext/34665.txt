Says Collin to Phoebe, while making of hay,
Sweet Phoebe resolve me, and do no say nay?
Sin I'se rise with the lark, and I'se roost with the crow,
And court yow the day long, why wun yow say no?

PHOEBE.
Yow teaze me, and plague me, quite out o' my life,
Mun I se, tho'f I like yow not, make yow a wife:
Young Roger (when milked) will bring hoame my peayle,
On Sunday too treats me with cheesecakes and eale.

COLLIN.
When churning the butter or pressing the cheese,
When washing your dishes, or shelling of peas,
I'se oft steal from my flock, in oth' window I peep
And for theanking of yow, love, I'se neaver can sleep.

PHOEBE.
In yon cottage so neat, with the trees full of bloom,
Pears, apples, and plumbs, and a delicate room,
Roger kiss'd me, and hugg'd me, and swore it should be,
A lodging for no other female but me.
He kisses so sweetly I'se cannot denoy,
Shou'd he eask for a thousand, noa, truely, not I;
Then teaze me no more, for we ne'er shall agree,
Seek another may please yow &mdash; yow shanno ha' me.

COLLIN.
Con Roger attend on heas stock wet or droye,
Con he wash, can he shear, can he cure from the stoye,
Con he reap, con he mow, con he pitch, con he stack,
In nothing can Roger need I'se turn my back.
Tho'se he han a cottage, yet I'se better able,
In knowledge and labour to furnish your table,
With the sweat o' my browe, I'se resolved to troye,
And purchase a cottage for Phoebe and I.
