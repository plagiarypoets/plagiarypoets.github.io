My charge it is, those breaches to repaire
Which nature takes from sorrow, toil and care,
Rest to the limbs and quiet, I confer
On troubled minds; but nought can adde to her
Whom heaven and her transcendent thoughts have plac'd
Above those ills which wretched mortals taste.

Bright as the deathlesse gods, and happy she
From all that may infringe delight, is free:
Love at her Royall feet his quiver layes,
And not his mother with more haste obeyes.
Such reall pleasures, such true joyes suspence,
What dream can I present to recompence?

Should I with lightning fill her awfull hands,
And make the clouds seem all at her commands;
Or place her in Olimpus top, a guest
Among th' mortalls who with Nectar feast:
That power would seem that entertaining short
Of the true splendor of her present Court;
Where all the joyes and all the glories are
Of three great Kingdomes, sever'd from the care.
I that of fumes and humid vapours made,
Ascending doe the seat of sense invade.
No cloud so serene a mansion finde
To over-cast her ever shining minde,
Which holds resemblance with those spotlesse skies,
Where flowing Nilus want of raine supplies.
That christal heaven, where Phoebus never shrouds
His golden beams, nor wraps his face in clouds.

But what so hard which numbers cannot force,
So stoops the moon, and rivers change their course.
The bold Moeonian made me dare to sleep
Joves dreadful temples in the dew of sleep.
And since the Muses do invoke my power,
I shall no more decline that sacred bower
Where Gloriana their great mistresse lyes,
But gently taming those victorious eyes,
Charme all her senses; till the joyfull Sun
Without a rivall halfe his course has run:
Who while my hand that fairer light confines
May boast himselfe the brightest thing that shines.
