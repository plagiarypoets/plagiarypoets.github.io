Call on the viewless winds for woman's sighs,
Caught up by them into the liquid air,
Proclaiming grief to the unconcious skies;
Call on the earth to make her bosom bare,
To show the ocean in her depth that lies
Of human tears, all shed amid the cries
Of human nature's agonizing pain!
Bare all to view, and, with thy wondering eyes,
Behold the spirit's grief!  the heart's big rain!
Then say &mdash; why o'er the earth this flood of misery came,

With man's frail bark upon its billows toss'd,
The mast all shivering 'mid life's heavy gale,
The rudder gone, life's pointing compass lost,
While mental darkness crowds to fill the sail!&mdash;
But death, or soon or late, will burst the spell,
And fling the stormy clouds of life away,
Revealing to our eyes that heaven or hell&mdash;
The deeper darkness, or the brighter day,
Which Priests proclaim, and Poets twine throughout their lay!
