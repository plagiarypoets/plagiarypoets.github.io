But what most shew'd the vanity of life,
Was to behold the Nations all on fire,
In cruel broils engag'd, and deadly strife;
Most Christian Kings, inflam'd by black desire
With honourable ruffians in their hire,
Cause War to rage, and blood around to pour:
Of this sad work, when each begins to tire,
Then sit them down just where they were before
'Till for new scenes of woe, peace shall their force restore.
