Faire Ivorie browe, the bord Love banquets on,
Sweete lyps of Corall hue, but silken softnes,
Faire Sunnes that shine when Phoebus eyes are gon,
Sweet breath that breaths incomparable sweetnes
Faier cheekes of purest Roses red and white,
Sweet Tongue contayning sweeter thing then sweet,
O that my Muse could mount a loftie flight,
And were not all so forcelesse and unmeete,
To blaze the beautie of thy severall shine,
And tell the sweetnes of thy sondry tast,
Able of none but of the Muses nine,
To be arightly honored and grac'd:
The first so faire, so bright, so purely precious,
The last so sweet, so balmy, so delicious.
