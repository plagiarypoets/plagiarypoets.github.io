From themes impertinent, the thick-scrall'd pane
At length a respite craves. &mdash; The jest obscene,
Acrostick's fulsome note, or slander's sting,
Alike I hate &mdash; detest &mdash; Be it my wish,
In grateful lines, justly to celebrate
A NORFOLK DUMPLING'S praise; &mdash; Belov'd repast!
With extasy I name thee!  Had thy bard
Poetic fancy equal to his appetite,
On Fame's high pinnacle thoud'st stand rever'd
For charms unequall'd!  Whilst the modern epicure,
Whose rav'nous maw threats ev'ry element
For food exotic, with depopulation,
Should linger as he read.  Not in the dish
Of far-fetch'd delicacies, such as grac'd
A loyal city's table, when presided
Britannia's darling Princes, could be found
A Gusto half so noble, half so fine,
As this, when from the bubbling cavern's mouth
Comes reeking, straight in dripping-pan immerg'd
From goose, or duck, or leg of pork produc'd,
The savoury show'r imbibes!  Oh, could I paint thee
In different vestments clad!  When at Meridian
Joan waits her faithful messmate, how thou'rt seen
Majestically rob'd!  Whilst round thy throne
Molosses rolls his salutary tide
Luxuriant! &mdash; Nor in estimation less
Art held, when wallowing in the golden flood
Of pease and bacon soup!....

&mdash;Here bait, my pen!
Lest like thy poet thou grow'st faint describing
What taste alone can prove! &mdash; Be Norfolk then
For Dumplings, Nogg, and Plenty ever fam'd!
