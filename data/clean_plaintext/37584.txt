Sweet visitant, who lov'st the hallow'd shrine,
Devoid of tremulous fear, who joy'st to flit
Athwart dim-colour'd lights
That Gothic windows shed;

I bless thee, warbler, bless the care of Heaven,
That in thy tuneful breast, this instinct breath'd,
Here, shelter'd from the blast
Thou pour'st thy carols round.

Here, hid from fowler's eye, secure thou liv'st,
By tabby foes unwatch'd, or wanton death.
Meantime, thy hapless mates
Or murder'd, stain chaste snows,

Or, shivering, die amid the forest-wilds,
The swollen victims of keen wintry winds;
While sorrowing dirges, here,
Thou sing'st o'er many a grave.

Sweet care of gracious Heaven!  thy future life
Haply the bright celestial fields may glad,
There thou in evergreens,
May'st thy soft texture weave:

There fondly mark'd by purer eyes than mine,
And there, with never-dying warbles blest,
Thou may'st the shades enjoy
In unmolested bliss.
