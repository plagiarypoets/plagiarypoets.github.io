Why weep the tenants of yon shatter'd grove?
Why mourns the black-bird in a dismal note?
Ah, note, far diff'rent from the lays of love;
That, once, my solitary musing smote.
See!  the sad nest to quiv'ring pangs devote,
The cruel sportsman takes his deadly round,
Thro' all the scenes, harsh screams of danger, float,
The fatal tube is full, it marks the ground,
And frighted echo starts, and thunders to the sound.
