When potent Henry o'er this sea-girt Isle
The sceptre sway'd, and rul'd with iron rod,
The Monarch's self was held in thraldom vile;
He bow'd his head to Rome's imperial nod.
The School-man's weapon he assum'd,
His crest 'gainst Luther too he plum'd,
The sacred HIERARCHY of ROME maintain'd;
The FAITH'S DEFENDER, thus was six wiv'd Henry nam'd.

The triple-crown'd LEO, he who bore
The Trident of the BABYLONISH WHORE,
Smil'd at the Royal Pedant, and by the Bull,
The sacred title authoriz'd in full.
When lo!  across the Monarch came,
Ann's beauteous lightning &mdash; and the flame
Shot from her magic-glancing eyes,
The Monarch caught with wild surprize:
The sacred bonds with Catherine he broke,
And spurn'd at Clement's Bull and iron yoke.

Then, trampling on the laws of God, he rose
HEAD of the CHURCH, and curs'd, and damn'd her foes.
The Holy Monast'ry no more
To pious Monks unlocks her door;
The shrines all fall &mdash; the altars shake;
Rome's pillars tremble &mdash; Priests all quake.
Astonish'd EUROPE saw the Monarch's plan,
Abhor the tyrant, yet applaud the man.

While on his throne elate, he sat and smil'd,
God's Vicar humbl'd, in his plans beguil'd,
One impious hand the tables broke
Of God &mdash; the other broke the yoke
Of Rome's imperial lawless lord;
While Henry, hated and abhorr'd,
Threw off the mask &mdash; and shew'd the mighty farce,
Bid EUROPE, POPES, PRIESTS, ALL kiss his &mdash;.
