Beside a stream, and 'neath a shade repos'd,
A form accoutred in a vestment rare,
High curv'd his arching brow, his eyes were clos'd
In sleep, which seem'd unruffled with a care;
Ah!  who could gaze upon his features then,
And deem them his &mdash; the Outlaw of the glen,
He of the blood-stain'd hand, unknown to spare&mdash;
But that his fire arms, and his belted blade,
And cold dank bed, confess'd his ruthless trade.

He slept, he dream'd, for in repose he smiled,
Fancy seem'd ranging 'midst the scenes of youth,
Ere he for crime was from his home exil'd,
(That dear abode of innocence and truth)
Or sought by lawless enterprise to live,
Happy with all his humble home could give,
His heart embued with tenderness and truth:
Thus fancy ranging back with boundless scope,
Tinted his cheek with the bright hues of hope.

Alas!  that youth should from such happy sleep,
To scenes of rapine, and to bloodshed wake;
Long did the night breeze low-ton'd breathings keep,
Nor did the slightest branch of willow shake;
But a change came &mdash; dark clouds pass'd o'er the moon
With hurrying sweep, and a wild blast rose soon;&mdash;
And chill'd, the dreaming youth did sleep forsake,
And suddenly arous'd, gaz'd wildly round
For scenes of bliss &mdash; alas!  no longer found.

Those scenes were fled, yet left a record strong
Upon his mind, of years so fair, so bland,
That he in waking, could not think of wrong,
And smiling, gaz'd upon his blood-stain'd hand,
Unconscious how 'twas red, &mdash; till the loud clang
Of pistol shots, from the deep ravine rang,
And thrice the bugle sounded a command:
He faulteringly obey'd &mdash; his heart was still
Amidst far dearer views of mountain, grove, and hill.
