I well record, a holy Father sayes,
"He teaches to deny, that faintly prayes:"
The suit surceases, when desire failes,
But whoso prayes with fervencie, prevailes;
For Pray'rs the key that opens heaven gate,
And findes admittance, whether earl' or late,
It forces audience, it unlockes the eare
Of heavenly God (though deafe) it makes him heare.

Upon a time Babel (the Worlds faire Queene
Made drunke with choller, and enrag'd with Spleene)
Through fell Disdaine, derraigned Warre 'gainst them
That tender Homage to Jerusalem:
A Mayden fight it was, yet they were strong
As men of Warre; The Battaile lasted long,
Much bloud was shed, and spilt on either side,
That all the ground with purple gore was dyde:
In fine, a Souldier of Jerusalem:
Charissa hight, (the Almner of the Realme)
Chill'd with a Fever, and unapt to fight,
Into Justitia's Castle tooke her flight,
Whereat great Babels Queene commanded all,
To lay their siege against the Castle wall;
But poore Tymissa (not with warre acquainted)
Fearing Charissa's death, fell downe, and fainted;
Dauntlesse Prudentia rear'd her from the ground,
Where she lay (pale and sencelesse) in a swound,
She rubb'd her temples (lost in swonny shade)
And gave her water, that Fidissa made,
And said, Cheare up, (deare Sister) though our foe
Hath ta'ne us Captives, and inthrall'd us so,
We have a King puissant, and of might,
Will see us take no wrong, and doe us right,
If we possesse him with our sad complaint,
Cheare up, wee'l send to him, and him acquaint.
Timissa (new awak'd from swound) replies,
Our Castle is begirt with enemies,
And clouds of armed men besiege our walls,
Then suer Death, or worse than Death befalls
To her, (who ere she be) that stirres a foote,
Or dares attempt, this place to sally out:
Alas!  what hope have wee to finde reliefe,
And want the meanes that may divulge our griefe?

Within that place a jolly Matron won'd,
With fierie lookes, and drawen-sword in hond,
Her eyes, with age, were waxen wond'rous dim,
With hoary locks, and visage stern, and grim;
Her name Justitia hight; to her they make
Their moane, who (well-advis'd) them thus bespake:

"Faire Maydens, well I wot; y'are ill bedight,
And rue the suffrance of your wofull plight,
But Pitty's fond alone, rankles griefe,
But fruitlesse falls, unlesse it yeeld reliefe:
Cheare up, I have a Messenger in store,
Whose speed is much, but faithfull trust is more,
Whose nimble wings shall cleave the flitting skies,
And scorne the terrour of your enemies,
Oratio hight, well knowne unto your King,
Your message she shall doe, and tydings bring,
Provided that Fidissa travaile with her,
And so (on Christs name) let them goe together.
With that, Fidissa having ta'ne her errant,
And good Oratio, with Justitia's Warrant,
In silence of the midnight, tooke their flight,
Arriving at the Court that very night;
But they were both as any fier hot,
For they did flie as swift, as Cannon shot,
But they (lest suddaine cold should doe them harme)
Together clung, and kept each other warme:
But lo, the Kingly gates were sparr'd, and lockt,
They call'd, but none made answere, then they knockt,
Together joyning both their force in one,
They knockt amaine; Yet answere there was none;
But they that never learn'd to take deniall,
With importunity made further triall;
The King heard well, although he list not speake,
Till they with strokes the gate did wel-nie breake.
In fine, the brazen gates flew open wide;
Oratio moov'd her suit:  The King replide,
Oratio was a faire, and welcome ghest;
So heard her suit; so graunted her request.
Fraile Man, observe, In thee the practice lies,
Let sacred Meditation moralize.
Let Pray'r be fervent, and thy Faith intire,
And God will graunt thee more then thy desire.
