'Tis a mighty fine song Master Collins has sung,
Of the Passions and Music of yore,
When her instruments sweet, from the boughs where they hung,
Those passionate gentlemen tore.

But I think I've a tale as romantic and wild
As Collins could plan for his soul,
Of Music, when merely a chattering child,
She lov'd o'er the woodlands to stroll.

One eve she enchantingly pour'd forth a tune
On the winds that career'd by her cell;
Tho' whether 'twas play'd on the harp or bassoon&mdash;
On my word, I can't readily tell!

No doubt 'twas a rich and enrapturing sound,
With many a soft-dying fall,&mdash;
But a groupe of fantastics sprang suddenly round,
And Miss Music of course gave a squall.

First Pride, with an air of pomposity, swore
"Such a slave he had long wish'd to keep;"
And Sloth mutter'd next, in a voice like a snore,
"How divinely she'd lull him to sleep!"

And palsy-struck Avarice tottering there,
Said in a querulous accents and slow,
"What a mint from the crowd at Bartholomew fair
Little Music would make in a shew!"

But War shook the plume o'er his helmet and cried,
"When his phalanx to battle he led,
Spite of Avarice, Sloth, or the pompous Sir Pride,
Little Music should play at its head."

And the claimants grew loud, and said terrible things,
Spite of Music's entreaties and cries,
When a chubby-faced boy, upon butterfly-wings,
Popp'd down as tho' dropp'd from the skies.

He and Miss, it appear'd, had been cronies of old,
For the moment the urchin came there,
She started on tip-toe, undaunted and bold&mdash;
Which of course made the Passions all stare.

And the urchin return'd her an arch kind of leer,
Which, be sure, had some wickedness in it;
For he laughingly whisper'd a word in her ear,
Then snatch'd her on high in a minute!

That Music had wings, in an instant she found,
For they started up feather by feather,
And from that joyous moment the sweet Queen of Sound
And the young God of Love fly together!
