Some countryes vaunte themselves in pyes,
And some in meate excelle;
For turnippes of enormous size
Faire Norfolke bears the belle.

Thilke tale an olde nurse tolde to me,
Which I relate to you;
And well I weene what nurses say,
Is sacred all and true.

At midnighte houre a hardie knighte
Was pricking o'er the ley;
The starres and moone had lost their lighte,
And hee had loste his waye.

The winde full loud and sharp did blowe,
The clouds amaine did poure,
And such a night, as storyes shewe,
Was nivir seene before.

In vaine hee soughte full halfe the nighte,
Ne shelter colde hee spie:
Pitie it were so bolde a knyghte
Y-sterv'd with colde sholde dye.

Now voices straunge assaile his eare,
And yet ne house was nie:
Thoughte he, the devil himselfe is here,
Preserve me, God on hie!

Then summon'd hee his courage hie,
And thus aloud 'gan call;
Fays, gyauntes, demons, come not nie,
For I defye you all!

When from a hollow turnippe neare
Out jump'd a living wighte;
With friendly voice, and accents cleare,
He thus address'd the knighte.

"Sir knighte, ne demon dwelleth here,
Ne gyaunte keepes this house;
But tway poor drovers, goodman Vere,
And honest Robin Rouse.

"We tweyne have taken shelter here,
With oxen ninety-two;
And if you'll enter, nivir feare,
There's roome enough for you."
