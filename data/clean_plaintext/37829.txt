I am come here to die! &mdash; the battle's yell
Hath fainted into stillness; &mdash; and I hail
Nature's bland voice again &mdash; the mellow swell
Of the far billow, which the moon-beam pale
Hath kiss'd into repose: &mdash; the evening gale,
Rich with the spoil of violets, seems to creep
On the charmed ear so softly musical,
As it would bid the wretched cease to weep,
And o'er the victor's rage fling the sweet spell of sleep.

Yes &mdash; let him sleep &mdash; and wake to toil again!
Yet be there other sleepers, round whose bed
The balmy tears of Eve are wept in vain,&mdash;
And morn will smile &mdash; it cannot wake the dead.
Spirits of song! &mdash; my brethren! &mdash; are ye fled?&mdash;
Ye have not lived to rue a tyrant's hate,&mdash;
To see your shrines &mdash; your dwellings ravished;&mdash;
I do not &mdash; dare not mourn your glorious fate;&mdash;
But feel that ye are gone &mdash; and I am desolate.

My lonely lyre! &mdash; my hand is on thy string&mdash;
It is the last &mdash; last time &mdash; my childhood's toy&mdash;
Fond solace of my youth, wilt thou not bring
To my last hour one parting note of joy?&mdash;
I do remember, when a wayward boy,
How I would woo thee, till my soul caught fire,
And glowed &mdash; and maddened in the sweet employ&mdash;
How I would far from human eye retire,
To talk in solitude with thee, &mdash; my lonely lyre!

Then, Mona!  'mid thy forest grandeur nursed,
I drank the rapture of thy Druid's strain;&mdash;
Then airy forms on fancy's slumber burst,
And youth's bright dreams, as beautiful, as vain.
Yet not at once that Druid loosed the chain,
That bound my soul, &mdash; and bade it, madly whirled
In fire-wheeled car, Heaven's peerless height attain:
But darkly &mdash; slowly the dread truth unfurled,&mdash;
And drew the curtain back, that veils another world.&mdash;

Sweet Memory!  touched by thee, enjoyment past
A brighter hue &mdash; a livelier beauty wears;
And thou art wont, in playful mood, to cast
The rainbow's lustre o'er a scene of tears:
Thus now, beneath thy softened tint, appears
The pang &mdash; the struggle, when my soul was riven
From all of Earth, that soothes &mdash; enchants &mdash; endears&mdash;
From human passion's blandishment &mdash; and given
With all its warmth of zeal, to solitude and heaven.&mdash;

The faith, I cherished, was a feeling rife
With poesy and grandeur and delight:
Oh!  when Belinus woke the world to life,
My eager hand would rouse his beacon bright!&mdash;
My song would chide the lingering gloom of night!&mdash;
And, as he rose, and, flinging from the sky
Round Snowdon's brow his glittering wreath of light,
Laughed on the waves, that smil'd responsively,
My spirit caught a glow for mortal breast too high.&mdash;

And him the storm-god Taranis, whose eye
Glares through the clouds in lightning, where the rout
Of mingled elements rolls hurrying by&mdash;
Him have I worshipped, &mdash; and his awful shout,
That chorus, by his deep voice bellowed out,
Was full of joy and melody to me.
I loved to hear it leap heaven's vault about;
Till Earth took up the song with noisy glee,
And pealed from all her hills its fierce antistrophe.

There be some moments to our musing given
Full of eternity! &mdash; and such were mine;
When I could feel this bosom &mdash; spark of Heaven&mdash;
This purer essence of a breath divine
Gaze back on what it had been &mdash; to its shrine
Of other years, or raise, in shadowy files,
Visions of future being, till it shine
Throned in the splendor of those sunny isles,
Where endless pleasures reign, and cloudless beauty smiles.

But such were lonely joys &mdash; the festive song,
The slow procession, and the solemn rite&mdash;
The shout, that rung the startled woods among,
"Gather the mystic branch, the year's last night
Melts into morn!" &mdash; these once could wake delight,&mdash;
'Twas proud to see the Druid throng sweep by,
Their white robes glistening in the Moon's young light;
Which, struggling through the oak's dark shade on high,
Glanced on the scene below of sacred revelry.&mdash;

Oft too we tracked the forest's deep abyss,
To seek such wilding herb, or summer flower,
In whose bright chalice evening's dewy kiss
Nursed health or poison: &mdash; at this dreadful hour
I thank those venomed leaves, whose kindly power
Shall free my longing spirit: &mdash; once I blessed
A charm, that, gathered from a fairer bower,
Poured refluent vigour through the purest breast,
That e'er for mortal youth love's trembling flame confessed.

Yes I did love her, though that love to me
Was all forbidden rapture! &mdash; her pale cheek
Sunk on my throbbing breast, &mdash; and droopingly
Bowed her frail form, so delicately weak;
I waved the vervain-bough, and strove to speak
The potent spell &mdash; Oh Heaven! &mdash; It died away
Her eye's delirious fire &mdash; the livid streak,
That stained her brow; and in its stead, a ray
Beamed forth, more mildly bright than parting blush of day.

Hence radiant phantom! &mdash; vainly beautiful!&mdash;
Thine eye's blue languor, and thy sun-kist hair
Have soothed my soul: &mdash; but now &mdash; 'tis cramped and dull
In the cold desolation of despair.
Hence loveliness! &mdash; I'll seek in thought the bare
And rugged piles, which Genii's strength and skill
Toiled, a proud temple to our gods to rear;
I'll think of that fierce pang, whose shuddering thrill
Froze me, when first I marked the vital stream distill

From human victim's side; &mdash; with ruthless aim
The priest had dealt the blow &mdash; the seer stood nigh,
Watching each motion of the quivering frame,&mdash;
Each strong contortion of the lip and eye.
He bade me strike my lyre &mdash; unknowing why
I tremblingly obeyed: &mdash; but &mdash; mark! &mdash; the while
The victim's sunken cheek beamed faint reply
To notes, that thus could deadliest throe beguile,&mdash;
And his pale lip grew still; &mdash; and froze into a smile.

These were thy rites, red Hesus! &mdash; but to thee
There was a gentler sacrifice of song.
How, 'mid the feast of shells, I've smiled to see
The whirlwind passions of the savage throng
Spell-bound by music; &mdash; now the war-note strong
Yelled, in deep concert to the martial strain,
That bounded swellingly my chords' along;&mdash;
And then I hushed them into tears again,
With a low wailing dirge for early valor slain.&mdash;

One night &mdash; one solemn night &mdash; with him, my guide
Of early youth &mdash; my Druid-friend I sought
The solitary shore &mdash; the breeze had died;
And scarce it's gentle kiss one dimple wrought
In Ocean's cheek: &mdash; he paused &mdash; the moon-beam caught
His face upraised to heaven, and, as it shone,
Tinged with a paler hue those lines of thought;&mdash;
He seized my lyre, and woke one deep &mdash; deep tone&mdash;
"Mortal, he cried, attend! &mdash; know God is God alone.

"Gaze forth into Creation!  view him there!&mdash;
His voice is thunder, and his shadow &mdash; light!
The forms of earth &mdash; the glorious gems of air
Are symbols of his attributes; &mdash; his might
Called this fair orb from Chaos and from night;
And yet again shall that blue sky be furled,&mdash;
That page deep stamped with characters so bright
Of praise and power, &mdash; again, to ruin hurled,
Fierce flames shall spread a pall above this smiling world."

Would that dread hour were come! &mdash; I could rejoice
To see those flames, in Earth's deep bosom pent,
Rear the red flag of havoc, and the voice
Of the Omnipotent, in thunder sent,
Annihilate the universe: &mdash; content
My soul fair Nature's blackening wreck would scan,&mdash;
Spring forth into its native element
And revel in its liberty &mdash; it can
Bow to the will of Heaven &mdash; but not the yoke of man.

My country!  I have gazed upon thy face&mdash;
Thy sleeping face &mdash; thy moon-light loveliness&mdash;
Then was such grandeur mingled with such grace,
I could scarce weep away the fond excess
Of passionate admiration &mdash; thy blue dress&mdash;
Thy beauteous zone of Ocean, &mdash; Snowdon's might,
Whose rugged sides each varied shade confess
Of ebon and of ivory: &mdash; at night
Say who could look on these, and weep not at the sight?

Yes weep &mdash; and love &mdash; and worship &mdash; so did I:&mdash;
But now grief, anger, hatred, shame, remorse
Have made the fountains of my soul grow dry,&mdash;
Have frozen the tide of feeling in its course.
My country thou art lost! &mdash; a tyrant's force
Winds his base chain around thy giant hills,&mdash;
Withers thy sacred oaks, &mdash; and, oh!  far worse,
Enslaves thy free-born sons, and coldly spills
Thy heart's best blood!  'tis well &mdash; he is no foe who kills.

We fought for thee, my country; &mdash; 'twas the strife
Of desperate rage &mdash; the struggle of despair&mdash;
The last wild stroke for liberty and life:&mdash;
We braved the invader in his fierce career,&mdash;
Thy Druid daughters with their flowing hair,
Poured in mad onset on the foe, and high
Raised the shrill shriek, &mdash; and tossed the torch in air;&mdash;
Thy grey rocks, echoing back their thrilling cry,
Sent the dread war-note forth &mdash; "To death or victory!"&mdash;

On &mdash; on we rushed; &mdash; the Roman's serried file
Shrunk, as it marked the coming tempest grow,
Then paused with sullen and contemptuous smile,&mdash;
And calmly stern &mdash; determinately slow,
Levelled at once the lance's bristling row.&mdash;
On &mdash; on we rushed &mdash; what reeked we if to die?
My brethren bared their bosom to the foe,
Blessing the murderer with their latest sigh,
Whose mercy gave but chains &mdash; whose death-blow &mdash; liberty.

Rejoice, proud Empress of a groaning world!
Where battle's crimson tide flows deep and strong,
Be thy triumphant eagle's wing unfurled!
And, when soft peace glides laughingly along,
Thine be the festive dance &mdash; the joyous song!
I do not curse thee, Rome. &mdash; Live, tyrant! &mdash; live!&mdash;
Yet is there One will measure wrong for wrong&mdash;
The God, &mdash; the God of vengeance; &mdash; He will give
As thou hast given, &mdash; for me &mdash; I spurn thee, and &mdash; forgive.

Ha! &mdash; 'twas the shriek of death! &mdash; again! &mdash; again!
What visions to my strengthened eye are given!&mdash;
A fiery shore &mdash; a blood-empurpled main&mdash;
Through lurid clouds of smoke, in tumult driven,
The scythe-armed chariot &mdash; helm, and buckler riven:&mdash;
Yes! &mdash; Britain triumphs &mdash; Britain's warrior-queen!
Rome bites the dust &mdash; Right bravely have ye striven,
Children of liberty! &mdash; the time hath been
When bards would hymn your praise &mdash; and yet again, I ween,

That time will come: &mdash; the veil is half withdrawn&mdash;
The future's veil of gloom &mdash; I see &mdash; I see
The horizon purpling with thy glory's dawn,
My native land! &mdash; thy soils shall yet be free&mdash;
And brave, &mdash; but not in vain &mdash; thy name shall be
The rallying-shout of nations &mdash; heard afar
In distant lands, and thundered o'er the sea;&mdash;
Thy blood red standard, victory's beacon-star,
Shall stream with meteor flash along the clouds of war.

And then, perchance, this fluttering soul of mine,
That thus in music sighs itself away,
Again shall prompt some happier bard, to twine
Thy fadeless oak-wreath with his rapturous lay&mdash;
To sing the triumphs of thy brighter day:&mdash;
Till then, farewell, dark Mona's woody dell!
Farewell, thou deep blue sea! &mdash; ye mountains grey!
Farewell, my lyre! &mdash; thy last expiring swell
Just echoes &mdash; it is past &mdash; my lonely lyre, farewell!
