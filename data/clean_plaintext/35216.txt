These princely towers, majestic in decline,
To some may give a retrospective eye
To the proud times of antient chivalry,
Or when the goblets foam'd with gen'rous wine.
Targe, helm, or battle-axe, th' aspiring mind
May with a noon-tide fervency inspire,
And feats of those long since to dust consign'd
In souls congenial wake a kindred fire;
But who from  life is wean'd by long distress,
Pleasures more calm and soothing shall beguile;
He most the vestiges of Time shall bless,&mdash;
For that he'll think the hands that rais'd this pile
Sorrow and anxious cares no more await,
Beneath the wail of woe, above the reach of fate.
