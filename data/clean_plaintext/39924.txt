My Comrades, in sorrow let's join,
The volunteer DUNSTAN is dead,
MELPOMENE, first of the Nine
For Elegy, &mdash; lend me thine aid.

His worth calls aloud for our lays,
The virtues in him were combin'd,
Concordance, how meet is his praise,
His equal how rarely we find.

His actions and words would agree,
In his bosom no rancour was known;
His passions were gen'rous and free,
He was stil'd SENSIBILITY'S own.

Ye virgins bring laurel and straw,
Round the tomb where our Comrade is laid
In wreaths it was fit for his brow,
But he's left us and Peace to his Shade.

Yes peace, gentle youth, to thy manes,
That were theme for a Laureat's best lay;
Though grief may incumber the strains,
The said tribute we gratefully pay.
