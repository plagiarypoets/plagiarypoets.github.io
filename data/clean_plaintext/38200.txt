On well-fledg'd wing the muse ascends,
And glows with Inspiration's fire;
O'er earth a daring glance extends,
And boldly sweeps th' extatic lyre:
But not to paint the field of blood,
Where many a dauntless hero stood&mdash;
She leaves to other bards to tell
Who bravely fought, or nobly fell:
And, charm'd with virtues more serene,
Enraptur'd hovers o'er Britannia's Queen.

When savage war awak'd surprize,
And many a dying groan was heard,
Her ear was open to our cries,&mdash;
Her prayer for white-rob'd Peace prefer'd
For well she knew what ills would spring
Beneath the shade of Discord's wing;
That want, with all her grisly train,
The mournful family of pain,
Would wake the hapless orphan's cry,
And dim with sorrow many a widow's eye.

With sympathetic feelings fraught,
And mercy beaming from her mind,
And all that purity of thought,
Which stamps her best of woman-kind;
Full oft she hears the tales of woe,
Like streams, in murm'ring accents flow;
And o'er the great, the gallant dead,
The silver tear of pity shed;
And, prompt her country to relieve,
Implor'd that peace the wonted pow'r to give.

Faction avaunt, with all thy schemes,
Thou parent of perpetual strife,&mdash;
That halcyon peace, with length'ning beams,
May gild the evening of her life;
And no prophetic fears destroy
Her mind's serene and settled joy;
But LOYALTY, each circling hour,
Exert her soul-combining pow'r,
And proudly tell to future days,
That Britain's Queen commands a Briton's praise.

Whilst Anarchy, with lawless stride,
Stalk's o'er the wretched realm of France,
And Death and Plunder, side by side,
From Cots to Palaces advance,&mdash;
Let US, uniting firm the while,
To guard this highly-favour'd isle,
Spurn with contempt the LEV'LLER'S plan,
Engrafted on "The Rights of Man,"
And prove, in spite of all they've heard,
We boast a QUEEN BELOV'D &mdash; A KING REVER'D.
