Yes, she was beautiful &mdash; divinely fair:
Majestic calmness sat upon her brow
Not in dull cold forbiddance, but an air
Of kindness mingled with that statelier show;
Her star-bright eye beam'd forth a generous glow
Beneath the darkling lid &mdash; but yet that light
Was mellow as the rays in friendship's bow;
Its pupil, sable as the jet of night,
Dazzled the gazer though itself serenely bright.
