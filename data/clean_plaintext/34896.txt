On Banks of Leven, whare canty gowdspinks sing,
An' ilka sinny brae wi' gowans spring;
Whare caller burnies wimple on their way,
An' lammies, loupin' 'mang the hillocks play;
Ae simmer e'ening, near a bonny haugh,
Right braw wi' buds o' birk an' sproutin' saugh,
Twa rosy lasses snugly sat them down,
Far frae the din an' a' the clash o' town,
Baith blyth, unkent a glouming hour to steal,
An' joke a while, tir'd at the weary wheel;
Kate look'd at Betty wi' a blinkan ee,
An' syne began to rant wi' meikle glee.

KATY.
O Betty, woman, troth I'm unco fain,
Since simmer's come anes mair to blush the plain,
Now ilka glen an rig's claith'd airy braw,
An' winter wi' his nippin' breath's awa';
The lav'rock lilts aboon in canty tank,
An' 'mang the knows the lads an' lasses wauk;
The brooms an' daisies scent the kintra wide,
An' a' that's airy dwells on Leven-side.

BETTY.
Yes, Kate, ilk bush an' hillock looks fu' gay,
An' a' the meadows smell wi' newest hay;
Amang the knows are lads and lasses seen,
An' routh o' young anes wanton on the green;
Nae mair wi' ingle will we need to spin,
But quat our dargue whane'er the ky come in,
Syne to the gait. &mdash; Ilk lassie wi' her jo,
May sauter far, ne'er fley'd for bogle-bo;
Free frae the yelloch o' auld maiden aunts,
Wha' pester youngsters wi' their hav'rel taunts,
An' 'cause themsels are lightlied by the men,
Wad marrows scarce allow to ane in ten.

KATY.
Ay!  weel I wat that's true; I ken mysel',
The tither e'en what meikle ill befel;
Young Patie frae the fair came o'er the rig,
In a' his Sunday's claiths right sound and trig;
Twa days before, we trysted then to tauk,
Or 'mang the saugh and hazle bushes wauk;
He darn'd himsel' till I shoul'd quat the wheel,
An' frae my crabbit aunty hidlins steal,
Whan, as misluck wad hae't, wha then came by,
But the auld maiden gaun to milk the ky;
She saw my lad, wi' birr up to him ran,
An' minted fair to scauld, to curse, an' ban;
Came o'er his noddle wi' the twa pint stoup,
Till a' his saul wi' fright began to loup;
Then ca'd him mony a name, o'er ill to tell,
An' swore he sure was guan the road to hell;
Bade him pack hame to gait he came in peace,
An' seek nae mair to ruin her poor niece:
Then in she came still in her barlick-hood,
An' furious on the floor rampagin' stood,
Miscu'd me fair, an said she'd gang hersel',
An' a' the story to the session tell:
This mony a day I'll ne'er dow bide her sight,
Nor anes, for a' she said, e'er think her right;
Fu' blythe wad mony a bonny lassie be
To hae a jo o' ony sic as he.
Amang our shepherds a' nane looks sae fair,
At kirk an' market he's the triggest there;
Deckt out in claith o' his ain glimmers woo',
'Tis hard to ken him frae the laird, I trow;
Wi' routh o' lair he's stockin' still his mind,
An' kena nae less than mony a braw divine.
I looe my lad &mdash; I'm sure he's fond o' me,
Wha cares how crabbit then may auntie be?
Whan he bids marry, ablins I'll comply;
I doubt if she the offer wad deny.

BETTY.
Troth I commend your wit.  She was nae blate
To treat your lad an' you in sic a gait;
Aft hae I thought, o' a' about the green,
A herd sae clever was na to be seen;
I'll ne'er forget, ae bonny morn in May,
Whan to the shealings I scour'd aff sae gay,
Right snod my gown, an' coats trus'd to the knees,
I skelpit brawly up the gowany lee;
Rought gat of milk, for a' the ky were ca'd,
My pails were soon as fu' as they cou'd ha'd;
Weel laden I came trudgin' hame my lane,
An' just as I the aiken wood had ta'en,
Aboon the bow'r whare, mony a heartsome day,
I, whan a bairny, us'd to link an' play;
I met wi' Patie cawin up his ewes,
An' rantin' o'er the Broom o' Cowdenknows;
Fu' snug I hid mysel' &mdash; to hear the sang,
Set down my pails the clover grass amang;
But he, ay gleg o sight, soon fand me out,
An' jeering spluz'd, what wark I was about?
I tald the truth, which pleas'd your Patie sae,
He sang the Cowdenknows, an' twa three mae,
Syne out his whistle took, an' play'd sae rare,
I prais'd the lucky hour that drave me there,
An' hameward held, still listnin' to the soun',
Which sough'd amang the hills baith up an' down;
Lang was I canty, an' my voice in tune,
For mony a day it kept my heart aboon.

KATY.
Hout, Meg, what need ye gie sae meikle praise;
The lads are wondrous vogie now-a-days;
There's nane but ken themselfs &mdash; tho', tweest us twa,
I like my winsome Patie best o' a';
But see  ye lass, the sin is hast'nin' down,
An' spraings o' reek are risen 'boon the town;
Let's up, an' o'er the crafts, I'll get the deil,
If aunty finds me up and frae the wheel;
We'll meet anither gloming er't be lang,
An baith take time to crack an' lilt a sang.
