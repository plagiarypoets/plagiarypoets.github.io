Fair Venus' Son, what means thine heben Bow?
Thine Arrows whetted on a bloody Stone;
Thy Mother laughing at our captive Woe,
And all too weak this vain poetic Moan?
Why doth she spread her silken Nets so wide,
Or why enmesh unwares poor thoughtless Men?
Or why our gathered Laurels all deride,
And bid her Myrtle scorn'd, aye, freshly bloom again?

Two gentle Youths, in Spenser's Lay well read,
Attentive to his manly virtuous Lore,
From Noise apart, and every Evil's Dread,
Life's Precepts hoarded, had a mighty Store.
What boot so late your Eyes to Sleep decline,
With studious Labours bought, or friendly Toil?
Your Arts, your Arms, says Lalage, resign,
And me triumphant view o'er every glorious Spoil.

She said, and erst where foul Deformity,
Daughter of Chaos, held her ancient Reign;
Ne pleasaunt Herb yet grew, ne honour'd Tree,
Ne Virgin danc'd, ne sung had Shepherd Swain.
The rocky Soil upturn'd at thy Command,
Fair Lalage, all wond'ring I behold;
Walks, Flowers, Fruits, Trees in beauteous Order stand,
Creation! &mdash; likest Eden seem'd that happy Mold.

But thou, chaste Eve, with ev'ry Grace adorn'd,
With Dignity, and soft attractive Love,
Hast thou thy votive Poet's Labour scorn'd,
And turn'd thy Chariot hence yborn by Dove?
Return, fair Nymph, and bless thy sweetest Bow'r,
Yet will I thee pursue with humble Vein:
Return, fair Nymph, and bless these Eyes once more,
And we shall lift thy Name with more Phoebean Strain.
