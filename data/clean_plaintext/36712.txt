Thou art so fair, so excellently framed,
There is such mind in thy soul-breathing eye,
As if its purer home in heaven it claimed,
And thence alone could draw its witchery;&mdash;
Thy voice hath such a soothing melody,
And on thy lightest thought such magic plays,
Like a bright fountain on the gladdened sky,&mdash;
Methinks, as on thy perfect form I gaze,
In peace should be thy paths, in pleasantness thy ways!

But when I think upon thy syren world,
Whose arms would clasp thee in their false embrace,&mdash;
Whose glittering banner in thy sight unfurled
From better views would turn thy lovely face;
Moulding thy docile spirit's winning grace
To the fair treasons of its painted wiles,&mdash;
I fain would snatch thee from that fatal race,
Whose giddy round each better thought beguiles,
And leaves the victor nought but pale and hollow smiles!

So, &mdash; when before the eyes of lofty Rome
The Anglian captives stood, a blooming band,
Breathing of beauty from their sea-girt home,
And proudly, in that far and foreign land,
Recalling their white island's rocky strand,&mdash;
The Patriarch spake with mild and pitying eye,
And said, as their majestic forms he scanned,
"Worthy their name! &mdash; like angels pure and high,
Angelic too should be their path and destiny!"
