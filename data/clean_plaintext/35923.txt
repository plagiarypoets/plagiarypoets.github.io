Where now is Homer?  or great Virgil where?
Or in what shadow does Ariosto walk,
That with Orlando's madness charm'd the world?
Where now is Dante?  in what region pure
Of that unbounded World he sung so well?
Or Petrarch, that to love was sworn to death?
Or Tasso, in whose stately verse we see
Whatever the great Roman was before?
Where is Malvezzi, in whose bitter sense
The World may smile at it's own Tragedy?
Or, if we turn to England in our thought,
Tell me, where Chaucer may be found?  or where
Sweet Spenser, that from rebels fled to death,
His heart quite broken with the faulty time?
Where now may Milton meditate?  or he,
That sung the praises of a country life,
Himself condemn'd in cities to abide,
The rebel's foe, forsaken by his king,
Ingenuous Cowley?   but, above them all,
Tell me, O Muse, for thou alone canst tell
Where is immortal Shakespeare, at whose birth
Great Nature was expended to the lees,
And Death forsook his empire o'er the world?
Or that extravagant and erring soul [Chatterton],
That fled in youth from out the bounds of time,
Since nothing here was equal to his thought?
May God forgive him!  wheresoe'er they be,
Or in the Moon, or in the sprinkled stars,
Dividing day and night with punctual love,
Or else laid up within the silent earth,
To bud abroad, like flow'rets, in the prime
Of summer, when the wakeful trump shall blow;
This I pronounce without the awe of fear,
Time, were it lengthen'd out beyond the space,
That yet has pass'd o'er the created globe,
Redoubled to our sense, shall never yield
A harvest of such spirits to our hope....
