Cajol'd by oily speeches, and so forth,
I once was weak enough to stoop for fame,
To a small JUNTO; low, without a name,
Hating the Muses and ingenuous worth,
Apollo frowning on each Asses birth.
Proceed, gray Babes!  let Verse be still your game,
Scout it as worst of libels on your shame,
And, what Ye can, extirpate it from earth.
Mistake me not!  think Ye that I repine
Whilst Spenser, Milton, Cowley, Mason, Gray,
And Matchless Dryden, High-priest of the Nine,
Did each full oft experience in their day,
How vain the task their long-ear'd Judges to refine,
Tho' Orpheus old had tun'd the moving lay!
