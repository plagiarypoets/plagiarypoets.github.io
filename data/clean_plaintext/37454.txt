I.
O thou whose magic power
Can ev'ry bliss restore,
Which chance or baleful destiny oppose;
Who, prone to ease Distress,
And all her cries redress,
Com'st at Misfortune's call, and cheer'st her woes:

II.
Thou whose unbounded store,
Like seas without a shore,
Along the tide of Time increasing floats;
Who oft' with smiling ray
Illumes life's little day,
O nymph belov'd!  accept my lisping notes.

III.
When chill'd by Want's bleak blast,
The wanderer sinks aghast,
Thou bind'st his wounds and sooth'st his tortur'd soul;
Thy star divinely bright
Darts thro' the gloom of night,
And waves its genial fires from pole to pole.

IV.
Lo!  where with aching eye
The Child of Slavery
Unpitied groans beneath the tott'ring load;
His lot no respite knows,
No aid his friendless woes,
Save thine, who strew'st with flowers his thorny road.

V.
The trembling seamen's cries,
When threat'ning storms arise,
By thee are heard, from thee their comforts flow;
What tho' the rude winds roar,
And thund'ring billows pour,
Rise mountains high, or furious foam below:

VI.
Still, 'mid the mad'ning scene
Thy form benign is seen,
Still sweeps thy pinion o'er th' inclement waste;
While in the lurid air
Thy whisp'ring voice they hear,
Calming the chaos mass to murm'ring rest.

VII.
But most thy influence breathes,
Where Love her roseate wreathes
In some sequester'd vale delighted twines;
There oft' t' invoke thy aid,
Soft steals the list'ning maid,
There oft' resorts the train of rustic hinds.

VIII.
Tho' fix'd with vengeful hand,
Death's crew terrific stand,
Tho' grisly gleaming thirsts th' insatiate spear;
Yet ev'n in that dread hour
Thy heav'n-appointed power
Prepares the soul, and blasts th' expiring fear.

IX.
Friend of the bleeding heart,
Thy gentlest charm impart,
O deign to heal this grief-corroded beast;
So shall, enhanc'd by care,
Sweet Peace once more appear,
And all my silent sorrows sink to rest.
