That tear, Clarinda, why that tear suppress!
Feelings like these the noble soul declare,
To give the tribute due to wan distress;
To give to misery aid &mdash; at least a tear.
Hard is the heart, that never learn'd to bear
In part the woe, to which a friend is driv'n,
Nor pity's call, (sister to mercy) hear&mdash;
Mercy, the darling attribute of Heaven.
A soul like thine, to tenderest feelings given,
Must heave a sigh, while others feel a smart;
But may that soul with anguish ne'er be riven,
Such as distracts a hopeless lover's heart.
Thy sigh, thy tear shall with the wretched join;
Yet bear with fortitude each woe that's thine.
