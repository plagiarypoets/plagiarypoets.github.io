How sweet the moon beyond yon hamlet peeps,
And tips with silver all the distant trees;
How sweet she rises, now all nature sleeps,
And lulls the drowsy peasants into ease!

How still the air, how solemn is the scene,
How form'd for contemplation's mighty pow'r!
Mark how yon light that glimmers o'er the green,
Peeps thro' the crevice of yon ruin'd tower.

Here in this little spot, a num'rous heap,
Of friends and foes together lie forgot!
Here the forefathers of the village sleep
In peace, and leave mortality to rot!

Here wealth and poverty together lie,
Each mould'ring 'neath his own respective sod;
Know, man, we all alike are born to die,
To live, to sin, then dwindle to a clod!

No titles, rank, or dignity claim place,
The grave no vain distinction gives to birth;
Here rests in peace, the clown beside his grace,
Each in the bosom of his mother earth!

Ah!  what avail the gewgaws of the day,
The vain illusions of an idle hour?
Say, shall we not all soon be call'd away,
To yield that life, which withers like a flow'r!

Beneath this turf a little infant lies,
Freed from the anxious miseries of life:
Sleep on, sweet innocent, thy lot's a prize,
To leave a world of folly, care, and strife!

Yet we that live perhaps should think it hard,
To quit the world, its pleasures unenjoy'd:
Still when we taste them, where's the great reward?
Pleas'd for the moment, discontent and cloy'd.

Perhaps beneath this earth on which I tread,
Some ancient noble warrior lies conceal'd;
Whose name's forgot amongst the num'rous dead,
Whose fame unletter'd ne'er will be reveal'd!

But hark!  the village clock now warns me hence,
And bids me from this simple lesson learn,
How man's short life, how little is his sense&mdash;
From dust he sprung, to dust he must return!
