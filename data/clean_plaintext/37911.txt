At length the TASTEFUL-SISTER came,
Enchantress of the social claim!&mdash;
And to th' admiring crowd, her voice address'd;
Sweet Mistress of each charmful art,
To cherish life, or cheer the heart,
Of every care-dispelling power possess'd!
The SOCIAL-PLEASURES still attend her,
ART and NATURE, both befriend her,
And straight she views, with secret pride,
Sweetly smiling by her side,
The joyous SEASONS, eager pour
Each rich profusion of their fruitful store,
Of ASIA'S plain the pride &mdash; or boast of AFRIC'S shore!!&mdash;
Now, diviner pleasure fires,
Now, the MIRTHFUL-GOD inspires!
And when &mdash; (she sung in rapt'rous strain,)
NATURE gave to LIFE her pleasures,
Striving to increase her treasures,
Long she perceived the labour vain,&mdash;
Till pitying HEAVEN saw her care,
Approaching fast, to fix'd despair,
INVOK'D BY HER, &mdash; INVENTED WINE!!
When, grateful for the blessing sent,
Nature repaid the gift SHE lent,
And gave HER back the JOY &mdash; TO HER THE CHARM divine!!&mdash;
Won by the theme, &mdash; to LOVE the influence stole,
The grateful PASSIONS, feel the strong control,
And each, by turns, rejoice &mdash; and each, the boon extol.
