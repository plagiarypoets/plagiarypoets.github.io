I said, &mdash; "On the banks of the Stream,
I've pip'd for the Shepherds too long:
Oh grant me, ye Muses, a Theme,
Where Glory may brighten my Song!"
But Pan bade me stick to my Strain,
Nor Lessons too lofty rehearse;
Ambition befits not a Swain,
And Phyllis loves Pastoral Verse.

The Rose, tho' a beautiful Red,
Looks faded to Phyllis's Bloom!
And the Breeze from the Bean-Flower Bed
To her Breath's but a feeble Perfume;
The Dew-Drop so limpid and gay,
That loose on the Violet lies,
(Tho' brighten'd by Phoebus's Ray)
Wants Lustre compar'd to her Eyes.

A Lily I pluck'd in full Pride,
Its Freshness with her's to compare;
And foolishly thought ('till I try'd)
The Flowret was equally fair.
How, Corydon, could you mistake?
Your Fault be with Sorrow confest!
You said, the white Swans on the Lake
For Softness might rival her Breast.

While thus I went on in her Praise,
My Phyllis pass'd sportive along;
Ye Poets I covet no Bays,
She smil'd &mdash; a Reward for my Song!
I find the God Pan's in the Right,
No Fame's like the Fair-One's Applause,
And Cupid must crown with Delight
The Shepherd that sings in his Cause.
