Poets, Sir Blue, have maul'd Thee sore,
Just like great Burleigh heretofore;
Spencer to Him a Foe We see,
And P&mdash;pe was never Friend to Thee;
But Prose extols a Cecil's Name,
And Cambden gives a Right to Fame;
Who then, most admirable Knight,
Thy matchless Actions shall recite?
Say, what Historian wilt Thou fix on,
P&mdash;t, N&mdash;r&mdash;n, A&mdash;u&mdash;l, or Oldm&mdash;n?
