Come, thou soother of my cares,
Taper, snow-white tube of clay,
Let me fill thee to the top
Sweet thy taste at break of day.

See yon bench beneath the tree,
There I will thy sweets enjoy,
From my pocket snatch a book;
Books wth thee can never cloy:

Spenser, Dryden please me much,
Shakespear, Milton, better still,
But without thee cannot please,
Say or write whate'er they will.

Let the civit-cat supply
Beaus and belles with their perfume,
I'd no musk, indeed not I,
Thou art sweeter, I presume.

Bacchus, God of joyous wine,
Half his empire owes to thee;
'Tis from thy inspiring breath
Converse flows and social glee.

Hodge, returning from the barn,
Tir'd with labour, homeward goes,
Thro' short pipe he draws new strength,
Chears his heart, and warms his nose.

"Send me store of Indian weed,"
Hear, O Jove, this one request,
Let me but this good enjoy,
Kings and princes take the rest.
