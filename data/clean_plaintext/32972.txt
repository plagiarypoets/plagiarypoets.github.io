Renowmed Spencer, whose heavenlie sprite
Ecclipseth the sonne of former poetrie,
In whome the muses harbor with delighte,
Gracinge thy verse with Immortalitie,
Crowning thy fayrie Queene with deitie,
The famous Chaucer yealds his Lawrell crowne
Unto thy sugred penn, for thy renowne.

Noe cankred envie cann thy fame deface,
Nor eatinge tyme consume thy sacred vayne;
Noe carpinge zoilus cann thy verse disgrace,
Nor scoffinge Momus taunt the with disdaine,
Since thy rare worke eternall praise doth gayne;
Then live thou still, for still thy verse shall live,
To unborne poets, which light and life will give.
