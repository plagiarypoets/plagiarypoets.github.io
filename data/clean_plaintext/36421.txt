How like a Queen comes forth the lonely Moon
From the slow-opening curtains of the clouds,
Walking in beauty to her midnight throne!
The stars are veil'd in light; the ocean-floods,
And the ten thousand streams &mdash; the boundless woods,
The trackless wilderness &mdash; the mountain's brow,
Where Winter on eternal pinions broods&mdash;
All height, depth, wildness, grandeur, gloom, below,
Touched by thy smile, lone Moon!  in one wide splendour glow.
