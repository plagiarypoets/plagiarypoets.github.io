A wanton wether had disdain'd the bounds,
That kept him close confin'd to Willy's grounds;
Broke thro' the hedge, he wander'd far astray,
He knew not whither on the public way.
As Willy strives, with all attentive care,
The fence to strengthen, and the gap repair,
His neighbour Roger, from the fair return'd,
Appears in sight, in riding-graith adorn'd;
Whom, soon as Willy, fast approaching, spies,
Thus to his friend, behind the hedge, he cries&mdash;

WILLY.
How de ye, Roger?  ha' ye been at 't fair?
How gangs things?  Made ye onny bargans there?

ROGER.
I kno' not Willy, things deant luke owre weel,
Coorn sattles fast, thoff bease 'll fetch a deal,
Te sell 'tawd intack barley, I desaun'd,
Bud cuddent git a price to suit my maund;
What wi' rack-rents, an' syke a want of trade,
I kno'nt how yan's te git yan's landloords paid.
Mair oure au that, they say, i' spring o't year,
Franch is intarmin'd on't te 'tack us here.

WILLY.
Yea mun!  what are they cummin hither for,
Depend upon't they'd better nivver storr.

ROGER.
True, Willy, &mdash; nobbut Inglishmen 'll stand,
By yan another o' their awn good land,
They'll nivver suffer (Ise be bun to say)
The Franch te tak a single sheep away.
Fightin' for heame, upo' their own fair field,
All pow'r i' France cud nivver mak' 'em yield.

WILLY.
Whaw, seer you cannot think, when put ti't pinch,
'At onny Inglishmen i'll ivver flinch!
If Franch dea cum here, Roger, I'll be hang'd,
An they deant git their sens reet soundly bang'd:
I can't bud think (thoff I may be misteean)
Not monny on 'em 'ill get back ageean.

ROGER.
I think nut, Willy &mdash; bud some fouk will say,
Our Inglish fleet let 't Franch ships git away,
When they were laid (thou kno's) in Bantry Bay;
'At they could ne'vver all hev geen 'em 'tslip,
Bud 'tInglish wanted nut te tak a ship.

WILLY.
Eah!  that's all lees!

ROGER.
I dinnot say it's true,
It's all unnone te syke as me an' you,
How do we kno' when fleets do reet or wrang?
I whoop it's all on't fause &mdash; but so talks gang.
Howsivver this I kno' 'at when they please,
Our sailors always beat 'em uppo't seas,
And if they nobbut sharply luke about,
They needent let a single ship cum out;
At least they'll drub 'em weel, I dinnot fear,
An' keep 'em fairly off, fra landin' here.

WILLY.
I whoop sa, Roger, bud, an if they dea,
Cum owre, I then shall sharpen my awd lea.
What, thoff I can bud o've a lautle boast,
You kno' yan waddent ha that lautle lost,
Ise send our Mally an' all't bairns away,
And I mysen 'll by the yamstead stay.
I'll fight, if need; an' if I fall, whaw then,
Ise suffer all the warst mishap mysen:
Was I bud seer, my wife and bairns were seeaf,
I then sud be to dee content eneeaf.

ROGER.
Reet Willy!  Mun, what, an they put us tea't,
I will mysen put forrad my best feat;
What, thoff I's awd, I's nut sa easily scar'd,
On his awn midden, an awd cock fights hard.
They say a Franchman's turn'd a different man,
A braver, better soldier, ten to yan;
But let the Franch be turn'd te what they will,
They'll find 'at Inglishmen are Inglish still,
O' their awn grund they'll nowther flinch nor flee,
They'll owther conquer, or they'll bravely dee.
