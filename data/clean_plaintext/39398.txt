The Eve the Sun went down in golden clouds,
A breath of violets was on the air,
The Robin's first sweet voice was in the woods,
In deeper splendour flush'd the Evening Star,
The Moon on the horizon's curve afar,
Pour'd on the sleeping stream a richer glow,
Laving its beams like silver bar on bar
On some smooth treasure floor; the stream's still flow
Reflected every Star, and was a Heaven below.

Why was this peaceful pomp of Earth and Heaven?
'Twas at this hour our first fair mother gave
Her hand in Paradise, &mdash; and since that even
No wilder air must wander on the wave
Than the young violet's breath, on cliff and cave
The first bird sings, the cloudless Moon beams shine
To guide the lover, love's delighted slave&mdash;
To meet his beauty at the wild-wood shrine,
For this is thy delicious eve &mdash; St. Valentine.
