By triple walls and brazen towers,
And frowning parapets sustain'd,
Tho' Magdeburg defied the powers
Of war, and every foe disdain'd;
Yet won, like Danae, by gold,
Her pride succumbs, her gates unfold,
She sells the ravisher her venal charms,
And finds, (alas too late!)  destruction in his arms.

Almighty gold, to thy control,
Man is the ever yielding slave;
As thy behests transform his soul,
The true are false, the timid brave.&mdash;
By thee, the Prussian king, betray'd,
Saw his fair realms in ruin laid;
By thee, Napoleon bought his iron crown,
By thee, the lance was tipp'd, that dash'd his rivals down.

Yet why should mortals, blind to fate,
For thee exchange their peace and rest;
And madly gorge thy fatal bait,
Until it rankles in the breast.
Wealth has a long and hideous train
Of terror, doubt, disease, and pain,
While o'er the lowly unambitious head,
The Heavenly powers, unask'd, their silent blessings shed.

Slave to no love of pomp or place,
And rich because my wants are few,
I scorn the struggling, greedy race,
Who fortune's gifts incessant woo.
Far happier in my humble lot,
My modest wealth and quiet cot,
Than if, possessing an exhaustless store,
My discontented heart petition'd still for more.

Let nobles vaunt their high degrees,
Their stars that clothe an aching heart;
Let merchants toss our golden seas,
And tremble lest the waves should part;
They know not that my cot and field,
To me such tranquil pleasures yield,
As they in splendid mansions ne'er possess'd,
Tho' born of royal stock, or nurs'd on Fortune's breast.

What tho' no gilded domes be mine,
No crested carriage wait my call,
No goblets foam with Gallic wine,
No gaudy servants crowd my hall;
The lord of all this empty wealth,
Stranger alike to peace and health,
Would gladly see his dearest treasures spent,
To buy my little cot, embellish'd by content.
