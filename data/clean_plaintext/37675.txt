Oh thou, orr what remaynes of thee,
Rowley, streaming wythe the morning due,
Uppone the lethale daie,
To Redcliffe took his waie,
Wythe antiquarian Barrett for hys guide;
Than dydd hys furiouse hande
Steale monie deeds of lande,
Not even myghty Milles hys guilte can hide.

Into his baskett felle,
As ravenous as helle,
Thousandes of parchments went:
Brystowannes have y tolde,
That gests and stories olde,
Were written on those parchmentes wondrous quent.

Oh thou, where'er (thie bones att reste)
Thye spryte to haunte delyghteth best,
Whetherr on Bristowe Bridge, or Redcliffe Churche,
Or else 'mongst moth-devoured bookes,
In which bold Bryant sometimes lookes,
Tho' oft hys learnyge leaves hym in the lurche.

Or should thie spiritt chuse to stopp,
In Catcott's warehouse, or hys shopp,
And sigh to be amenged the pewter plates;
Orr ynne old Canygne's magic roome,
Envelopp'd wythe a twilight gloome,
Where Glynn, and Smith may wayle their emptie pates.

Orr 'mongst the pots, and bottles pil'd,
By busie Barrett staring wild,
Guarde alle thie sermons wyth religious care;
That Exon's Dean maie never finde
A perfect copie to his minde,
And print it as a booke of posies rare.
