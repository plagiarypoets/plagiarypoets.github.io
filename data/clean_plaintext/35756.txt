Yet may I not my thankful labour cease,
'Till this sweet work in part I dedicate
To you, heroick Lord, in war and peace,
The equal grace, and glory of the state;
So well the rugged virtues you abate
With the soft charm of affability,
And wisely in your lofty thoughts amate
Dread warfare with divine civility:
Then let this golden book for tribute be,
Which you, my Lord, may worthily accept;
Made by that man, that held the world in fee,
Yet early in heroick laurels slept;
Who slept, yet sits aloft, and smiles on you,
His kinsman in great birth, and glory too.
