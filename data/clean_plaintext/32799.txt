Come Death the anchor-hold of all my thoughts,
My last resort whereto my soule appeales,
For all too-long on earth my fancy dotes,
Whilst age upon my wasted body steales.
That hart being made the prospective of horror,
That honored hath the cruelest faire that lives,
The cruelest faire, that sees I languish for her,
Yet never mercy to my merrite gives.
Thys is her Lawrell and her triumphes prize,
To tread me downe with foote of her disgrace:
Whilst I did build my fortune in her eyes,
And layd my lives rest on so faire a face;
Which rest I lost, my love, my life, and all,
So high attempts to low disgraces fall.

[sig. C3]

Come Time the anchor-hold of my desire,
My last Resort whereto my hopes appeale,
Cause once the date of her disdane t' expire:
Make her the sentence of her wrath repeale.
Rob her fair Brow, breake in on Beauty, steale
Powre from those eyes, which pitty cannot spare:
Deale with those dainty cheekes as she doth deale
With this poore heart consumed with dispare.
This heart made now the prospective of care,
By loving her, the cruelst Faire that lives
The cruelst Fayre that sees I pine for her,
And never mercy to thy merit gives.
Let her not still triumph over the prize
Of mine affections taken by her eies.
