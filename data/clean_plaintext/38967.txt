Bandusia's spring!  more glittering-clear than glass,
Thy due the mellow wine, with no scant flowers,
A kid at dawn is thine:
Whose brow, just bourgeonning
With firstling horns, decides for love and war
In vain:  the stripling of the wanton fold
Shall tinge with ruddy blood
Thy crystal, cooling rills.
Thee the fierce dog-star in his blazing hour
Despairs to touch:  thou welcomest the herd,
Yoke-harrass'd, and stray flock,
With thy voluptuous cool.
Thy place is with the famous streams:  for I
Have sung the green oak that o'ercanopies
Yon cave-worn rocks, whence leap
Thy bubbling water-falls.
