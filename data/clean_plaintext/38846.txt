Here rests his head upon the lap of earth,
A Curate poor, to stalls and tythes unknown;
No Bishop smil'd upon his humble birth,
No Minister e'er mark'd him for his own.

Bread was his only food, his drink the brook;
So small a salary did his rector send,
He left his laundress all he had, a book;
He found in Death all he wish'd &mdash; a friend.

No longer seek his wardrobe to disclose,
Nor draw his breeches from the darksome cell;
Here, like their master, let them find repose,
Nor dread the horrors of a taylor's hell.
