Methought I saw in dead of silent night
A goodly Citie all to cinders turned,
Upon whose ruines sate a Nymphe in white,
Rending her haire of wiery gold, who mourned
Or for the fall of that faire Citie burned,
Or some deare Love, whose death so made her sad:
That since no joye in worldly thing she had.

This was that GENIUS of that auntient TROY,
In her owne ashes buried long agoe;
So griev'd to see that BRITAINE should enjoy
Her PALLAS, whom she held and honour'd so:
And now no litle memorie could show
To eternize her, since she did infuse
Her Enthean soule, into his English Muse.
