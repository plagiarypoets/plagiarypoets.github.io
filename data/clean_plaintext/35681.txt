Pale Indians shiver at their fire,
The dazzling snow our eye-balls stun,
The skaters from the cold retire,
The water freezes in the sun,
And yonder cataract displays
From columns Iris' golden rays;
But Gratitude, sweet smiling guest,
The chilling cold expels and warms my throbbing breast.

Hail Gratitude, soft-blushing maid,
By gods and men alike belov'd,
Despatch'd to gentle Virtue's aid,
To make her duties more approv'd;
With Goodness tripping on before,
You guide her to the wretched door;
Again behind you hold her train,
Smile off her cautious fears and shake your golden chain.

Anon you lead the heavenly choir,
The sainted host in rapture gaze,
You strike with love th' eternal lyre;
And sound delightful notes of praise;
While angels from on high proclaim
That men may join th' ecstatick theme,
To Gratitude alone is given,
The thankful soul of man to raise from earth to heaven.

The offerings of a grateful heart,
O waft benignant nymph divine,
To B&mdash; some pleasure thou'lt impart,
At sacred Truth's refreshing shrine;
For there he studies Nature's page,
Or saunters with Sicilia's sage,
Admires the depth of Bacon's mind,
And Newton lifting Nature's veil that kept us blind.

Perhaps his mind illum'd portrays,
From systems free the human race;
The native worth that man displays,
His various sources of distress,
By Freedom blest, a demi-god,
A beast when rul'd by Nero's rod,
And all his frame with ardour glows,
To sooth with healing balm, or banish mortal woes.

O Truth, enrob'd in snowy white,
Your fav'rite's modest doubts dispel,
That he may spread your precious light,
And then inspire a nobler shell
To sound aloud his glorious name,
To class him with the sons of fame,
While Gratitude, celestial guide,
Each heart inspires to hail, their country's boast and pride.
