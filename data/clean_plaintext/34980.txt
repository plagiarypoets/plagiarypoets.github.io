Whoe'er thou art, that lov'st the barbarous rhyme,
The festive march, and no unpleasing tone
Of uncouth minstrel-songs i' th' olden time,
Attuned to harps in raptures all their own;
Here bend thy rede awhile, nor rudely spurn
This transitory page, ne'er doomed to life eterne.

Oh might I gain one dribbet of their sprite,
As all inglorious on the peaceful shore,
I mark the forms Pierian, orders bright,
And scan with reverence their mysterious lore;
Or trace the motley scenes of comic life,
Each magic hue that blends in ever-varying strife.

In vain I call:  stern unrelenting fate
Knows not the voice of mortal wight on ground:
No more. &mdash; Then hasten to th' ideal gate,
And tread with me the blythe Elysian round;
For lo!  on high, while Momus rules the hour,
The Samosatian star beams with ascendant power.

Thus may these notes of well-attemper'd mirth
Responsive vibrate to the frolic string:
Untouch'd each honour'd name of living worth:
Minos shall nod; while on excursive wing,
Waving the potent branch, serenely gay,
Pass we the realms of light and drink their golden day.
