It was a lonely hamlet, where the trees
Waved, in green beauty, o'er the white-wash'd cot;
Deep'ning the shade, as the light summer breeze
Cluster'd the boughs, so beams of sun came not;
Beneath smil'd cottage flowers &mdash; 'midst all a brook
Ran hurrying off to a sequester'd nook;
Then bursting forth beside a rose-wreath'd grot,
Mirror'd its beauties &mdash; for toil were given,
To mix the flowers of earth, and clouds of heaven.

All seemed enchantment in the flowery dell,
Yet all was solemn silence &mdash; no glad thrill
Of children's voices, breathing forth her spell
Of hope and early life &mdash; all, all was still;&mdash;
And yet 'twas summer's bright unclouded noon,
When May's pale flowers gave place to those of June;
'Midst which the roving Bee ranged forth at will;
At intervals was heard the Cuckoo's tone,
By mimic school-boy easy made his own.

Lo!  on the ear peal'd forth another sound,
And slow, and time-pac'd, came the funeral tread,
And one, the bier with fresh blown roses crown'd.
As tho' pale silk waved o'er the youthful dead;
Yet ill did the dark pall accord with the flowers,
And the bright sun of June's unclouded hours;
Whilst heavy sighs proclaim'd all joy was fled
From him, the childless father, &mdash; who gaz'd on
Scenes, which brought memories of the lov'd, and gone.

There the green oak in civil triumph bore,
The torn remains of the once favorite kite;
And the rose-tree display'd a beauteous store
Of rosy flowers, which budding, joy'd the sight;
And sideways spread a mound of unmown grass,
O'er which such bounding feet were used to pass;
All these seem'd shrouded in eternal night,
Since from their view the father could but borrow
Thoughts of past joy, to deepen present sorrow.

The bell ceased tolling &mdash; and the solemn tread
Of slow receeding footsteps died away,
Till all was gloom, &mdash; for thinking on the dead,
The village children had forgot their play;
They miss'd their lov'd companion &mdash; he who'd chase
Their fleetest footsteps oft, and win the race;
Sadness, and silence, mark'd the weary day;
E'en mothers fearfully looked on the bloom
Of their lov'd boys &mdash; and thought upon the tomb.
