Sweet flow thy numbers, Oh!  ingrateful fair,
And tuneful error marks thy polish'd rhyme;
But know tho' mine to give the silver hair,
'Twas thy own Thyrsis, beg'd the boon of Time;
Thyrsis high glowing yet in manhood's hour,
Who prematurely sought an earnest of my pow'r,

Mov'd by his pray'r those wintry wreaths I wove,
Twisting my snow-drops with the rose of youth;
But still 'twas Thyrsis's gentle fraud to prove
His Daphne's friendship, and his Daphne's truth:
"Oh!  strew thy partial whiteness, thus he said,
Oh!  let thy snowy symbols strait invest my head.

"So shall I see, if chill'd by thy advance,
She with life's summer moment's shall recede;
So shall I see, if with youth's fleeting glance,
From age's menace, Daphne too shall speed.
So shall I triumph if I find the fair,
Defy the snowy wreaths, the monuments of care."

Then wherefore tyrant?  Fair ingrate 'tis mine,
When falls man's short-liv'd blossom of an hour,
To touch affection with a bloom divine,
And proud expand truth's never-dying flower,
To lift fair constancy to seats sublime,
E'en 'bove myself &mdash; above the pow'rs of Time.

Ah!  then let mem'ry and the Muses know,
Thou lovely satyrist shouldst bless my reign;
My pow'rs alone could deathless charms bestow,
Which prov'd the fondness that inspir'd thy strain.
Since but for those white omens of my sway,
The world had wanted Daphne's faithful lay.
