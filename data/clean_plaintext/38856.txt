Colin, the tend'rest of Mankind,
Was bless'd with every Art
To gain the wishing Virgin's Mind,
And bend the amorous Heart;
Of manlike Form, and Strength possess'd,
Whate'er the Eye cou'd move,
Yet Colin's tender artless Breast,
Was wholly form'd for Love.

Phoebe, the fairest of the Fair,
With every winning Grace,
That cou'd th' admiring Eye ensnare,
Enjoy'd an Angel's Face:
An Angel's Face, but ah!  how fast
The brightest Forms decay!
While Virtue's Charms for ever last,
And she was chaste as they.

This Couple in each other bless'd
Had every Want supply'd,
And each of mutual Bliss possess'd,
Look'd down on all beside:
No Cares prolong the fleeting Hour,
Nor on their Pleasures wait;
Ambition flies the peaceful Bow'r,
They wish not to be great.

But while their Flocks together feed
She sings an amorous Lay;
Or else He tunes his warbling Reed,
And charms the Time away:
The Birds attentive to her Song
Return their warbling Notes,
Or his sweet Melody prolong
With imitating Throats.

Now Colin plucks the blooming Flow'rs
His fair one to adorn,
And soon the Pride of all the Bow'rs
In Phoebe's Locks is worn:
Now see her snowy Breast expands,
Which with new Fervour glows,
While happy Colin's welcome Hands
Insert the blushing Rose.

Alike the happy Couple are,
By the same Pleasure mov'd;
Alike each others Grief they share,
Each loving and belov'd.
When any Pain disturb'd his Rest,
She sunk her sorrowing Head;
When he a mournful Sigh express'd,
A mournful Tear she shed.

If ought the happy Shepherd please,
Joy sparkles in her Face;
Good Nature, Love and smiling Ease,
The happy Couple grace:
If any Sickness him oppress,
He sinks upon the Fair;
And soon he thinks it pains him less,
And soon forgets it there.

If ought the beauteous Nymph annoys,
Dear Partner of his Heart,
Sweet Herbs he culls, all Arts employs,
To ease the tortur'd Part:
And when she sees him rack'd with Fears,
She Smiles amidst their Pain;
And strives to stop her bursting Tears,
Lest they should grieve her Swain.

No other Care their Time beguiles,
But Fears that spring from Love:
All Love, all Tenderness, all Smiles,
Their Mutual Pleasure prove.
Long happy may the Pair remain!
No Grief their Breasts invade!
Copy, ye Shepherds, from the Swain,
Ye Virgins from the Maid.
