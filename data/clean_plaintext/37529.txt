The simplest reed which nature's minstrel loves
Beneath some pastoral shade to woo the spring,
Or welcome summer, round whose plenteous brows
The earth's best fruits are seen,

Will not be heard by thee, O Winter foul!
Whose storms arising from the blasting south
Numb all its powers, and with their dreary yells
Out-drown its untaught voice.

As dun October, foremost of thy train,
By Boreas warn'd, his naked figure spread,
And led by Eurus, in his snow-lin'd car,
Begins thy frozen march;

While Autumn shrinking from his rude embrace,
O blasting Winter waves his sallow hair,
And wildly views thee wrapt in cloudy veil
With threat'ning looks approach.

To chain with icy fingers bath'd in dew
Each streamlet once so tuneful to its banks,
And hang on every mount or valley's side
Thy snowy banners grey;

Or quench with foul November's foggy breath
The sky's clear azure, and its golden light,
While nature, joyless like a widow, mourns
Thy ruthless withering touch.

Now, while thy terrors rob the frighted earth,
And nip each floweret which emblazon'd the vale,
And from the trees their latest foliage green
With frantic fury tear,

Let me retire within some sylvan cell,
Where peace and science make their blest abode,
And round the social hearth with friendship drawn,
Seek refuge from their power.

And there let Fancy, sweetest nymph, her smiles
Dispense, and spread her choicest hues around,
Such as by Shakspeare's sun beam'd eyes
In rainbow vestures clad:

While Solitude, the hermit queen, shall tell
How pleasure most in shadiest haunts is found,
And health shall court me with her ruddiest hue,
And mirth my temper crown.

Then Hope shall point with Fancy's fairy eye,
Where Spring, on rosy sandals dancing light,
Comes on, and drives thee, Winter, from our plains
To bleak Siberia's isle.
