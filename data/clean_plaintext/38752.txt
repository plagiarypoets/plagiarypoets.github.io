When first my sage Mother began to advise,
"Dearest Nancy (said she) to be virtuous and good,
To treacherous Man shut your Ears and your Eyes."
I promis'd for certain I wou'd if I cou'd.
On the Green when I danc'd, and the Lads call'd me fair,
While sighing and flatt'ring on Tip-toe they stood,
They begg'd I believe them, their Vows were sincere;
I told them I certainly wou'd if I cou'd.

And when my dear Jockey appear'd on the Plain,
Each elderly Maiden and ill-natur'd Prude,
All bid me beware of the blooming young Swain;
I said, with a Sigh, I wou'd if I cou'd.
He approach'd with Delight, and call'd me sweet Maid;
Then whisper'd with all the Respect that he shou'd,
If I offer'd my Hand, you'd refuse, I'm afraid;
I, laughing, reply'd, I wou'd if I cou'd.

Those Smiles are propitious, the Shepherd then cry'd,
Thy Meaning, tho' humble, be soon understood,
We'll meet in the Morn, and I'll make you my Bride;
I promis'd, with Blushes, I wou'd if I cou'd.
We met this blest Morning, and hasten'd away,
For my Shepherd is honest, and faithful, and good:
And I, simple I, said I've love and obey;
But certainly meant, that I wou'd if I cou'd.
