BOOK I.  CANTO IV.

THE ARGUMENT.
The Knight of the Red-cross and Duessa arrive at the House of Pride &mdash; Description of Pride, her Palace, Idleness, Gluttony, Passion, Avarice, Envy, Wrath, and Satan, her Attendants. &mdash; The Red-cross Knight agrees to combat him on the Morrow.

Ye valiant youths that seek for virtuous fame,
Noble pursuit and worthy of the soul,
Oh hearken to the Muse, whilst thus she sings,
Of Fraud and sad inconstancy beware,
In choice and change of her ye love the best,
Her virtues with the loudest trump proclaim,
Her frailties cover with the veil of love,
If faults she has, deep hide them your hearts,
Nor let a murmuring whisper taint her fame.

Now had the virtuous Knight been long deceiv'd
By feign'd Fidess' (Duessa rightly nam'd)
And lest chaste Una in ill-fated hour;
Far forth he travell'd (Falsehood by his side,
Oftimes mistook for Faith) at last they saw
A stately palace, reaching up to Heav'n;
Which seem'd the residence of some great prince.
Thither Duessa ask'd him to retire,
For the long ling'ring day was almost spent.
This towering fabrick, beauteous to behold,
Spoke loud the fame of the great architect,
The walls were high, but neither strong nor thick,
And golden foil all over them display'd,
That with their brightness they dismay'd the sky:
High lifted up were many lofty towers,
The windows in the highest stile were wrought,
And bowers delightful, and upon the top
A golden dial told the fleeting hours:
Here elegance with purest taste combin'd,
Whate'er might strike the sense, or charm the soul;
Yet all was semblance; for on nought but sand 
This building stood, and to the centre shook
At every breath of Heav'n:  the hinder parts,
Which few beheld, were ruinous and old,
But painted to delude:  the portals wide
Expanded to receive each stranger guest,
And charge of them was to a porter given,
Call'd Malvenu, who entrance ne'er refus'd,
A broad high way led to this stately dome,
And anxious crouds to see the queen repair'd;
Among them also came this virtuous Knight,
And Duessa the fraudful:  each amaz'd
At such o'erflowing wealth, surpassing far
Whate'er of courts or Persia's pride was heard.

On a rich throne, as bright as mid-day sun,
There sat a royal maiden cloath'd in gold,
Her peerless jewells shone like Titan's rays,
Yet did her beauty oft assay to dim
Th' amazing splendor, of her glorious throne,
As envying herself, that with such lustre
Exceeding shone like Phoebus' fairest child,
Who did presume to guide his father's wain,
And steeds unwonted wild, with flaming mouths,
Through highest Heav'n; when of such honours proud,
The flashing beams dazzling his feeble eye,
He leaves the welkin way; his wheels inflame
The skies, with fire not made to burn, but shine.
So shone this peerless queen in royal state,
And look'd to Heav'n, for earth she quite abhorr'd.
Beneath her scornful feet a dragon lay,
With hideous train, and in her hand she wav'd
A flatt'ring mirror, where she often view'd
Her lovely face, in which the graces seem'd
To hold their empire, yet 'twas fiction all.
Her worthless generation who can tell?&mdash;
Of griesly Pluto she the daughter was,
And Proserpina, queen of hell, her dam;
Yet did her pride assume to call on Jove,
That thunders loud and wields the world on high,
As on her Father; or if any else
High Jove excell'd, for to the high'st she soar'd,
Or if ought higher were to that aspir'd:
Her name on earth was proud Lucifera,
A queen she seem'd, yet royalty had none,
By tyranny she rul'd, and not by law,
And six bad counsellors her throne upheld.

Soon as the Knight and Duessa arriv'd,
Usher'd by Vanity they prostrate fell
At her high throne, professing loyalty:
With lofty eyes, half loth to look so low,
She bow'd disdainful, nor more grace vouchsaf'd:
Mean while her courtiers sought to catch their hearts,
With all the pomp of dress, each envying each,
For Duessa they knew, and with the Knight
Wish'd to increase their numbers, but in vain:
Their tinsel outsides sparkled not to him,
Their queen he thought too proud, nor ought admir'd.
Then suddenly arose the royal dame,
Her slaves attend, and quick her coach prepare,
Lo!  forth she comes, her brightness blazing high,
As fair Aurora in her purple pall,
Forth from the east to call the dawning day:
Lo forth she comes!  the thronging multitude
Annoy each other, eager to behold
Such blaze of glory, which attracts all hearts,
Save those who venerate fair Virtue's form.
Lo forth she comes, and to her coach ascends,
In gold and garlands sumptuously array'd,
As fresh she seem'd as Flora in her prime,
And wish'd to excel great Juno's golden chair,
Which gods beheld as she triumphant rides,
To Jove's high house, thro' Heav'n's brass-pav'd way,
Drawn of fair peacocks that excel in pride,
Their glitt'ring tails o'erspread with Argus' eyes:
But this her coach by six unequal beasts
Was drawn, on which her counsellers did ride.

The guide was Idleness, the nurse of kin,
Upon a slothful ass by choice he went,
In black array'd, a holy monk he seem'd,
His prayer book in his hand was little read,
For of devotion he ne'er heeded ought,
His heavy head he scarcely could uphold,
Nor knew nor cared whether 'twas day or night;
Such guidance could produce no good effect:
Each prudent care he shunn'd, and manly toil,
And ev'ry work for contemplation scorn'd,
But Riot mark'd his life, and passion's sway
Had spread a burning fever thro' his veins.

And by his side rode loathsome Gluttony,
Deformed creature, on a filthy swine,
With luxury, fill'd, his eyes with fatness swell'd,
Beastly he seem'd, and hated was by all:
In green vine leaves for coolness he was clad,
An ivy garland totter'd on his brow,
From whence the sweat fast trickled, still he eat,
And in his hand a boozing can he bore,
Of which he drank so oft he scarce could ride:
Intemperance fill'd him with each dire disease,
That more he seem'd a monster than a man.

And next to him rode lawless Appetite,
Upon a bearded goat, whose rugged hair
And whally eyes (emblem of jealousy)
Seem'd like his rider chastity to scorn;
Nor could he ever please the virtuous fair,
His falsehood and his follies still he strove
To hide beneath a robe of beauteous green,
And in his hand a burning heart he held,
Fill'd with incentives to allure the mind,
His chief delight was to delude the fair,
Whilst wedlock's holy chains with rage he spurn'd
Yet did inconstancy destroy his peace
And Sin's dire wages tortur'd all his frame.
Next greedy Avarice nodding o'er his gold,
With watchings worn, upon a camel came,
Two iron coffers hung on either side,
With precious metal to the top up-heap'd,
And in his lap another heap he held;
Gold was his god and usury his trade,
All sense of right and wrong he quite forgot,
For he had sold himself to Vice for wealth.
Tho' he was verging on death's awful brink:
Nor ever tasted ought that life affords,
Of sweet or pleasant, or of social kind,
No friend or relative to share his stores,
He led a wretched life, worn out with fear,
His wealth was want, his plenty made him poor.
Fell Envy next appear'd upon a wolf,
Between his canker'd teeth a toad he chew'd,
His venomous mouth with poison all distain'd,
Sad at this neighbour's wealth, he wept for want
Of others woe, but joyn'd at thought of harm:
His clothes discolor'd painted full of eyes,
And serpents made his bosom their abode,
Evil was all his good, he grudg'd the chear
Of his compeers, and gnash'd his angry teeth
At the ill gotten gold which Avarice had;
He hated all good works, and virtuous deeds,
Accus'd their authors, and the motives too,
Nor could the muse's lyre attune his mind.

Besides him next, upon a lion fierce:
(Fit emblem of his rider) vengeful Wrath
A burning torch he brandish'd round his head,
His staring eyes shot fire, his face all pale,
His trembling had a murderous dagger held,
His ragged raiment all distain'd with blood,
His ruffian breast endured not controul,
Nor recollected he what dire effects
Attend ungovern'd passion's lawless sway:
Yet num'rous mischiefs follow cruel wrath,
Unnatural murder, and tumultuous strife,
Abhorred bloodshed and unthrifty harm,
The rusty knife of rancour, sad despite,
And fretting grief the enemy of life;
With raging phrensies, spleens and palsies dire,
And all the pangs infernal spirits feel.

Satan himself rode last, and drove the team,
And lash'd it on, whenever ling'ring sloth
A moment loiter'd on the dirty road.
Huge routs of joyous people shouting ran,
Whilst a thick fog conspir'd to dim their eyes,
And hide the slaughter'd thousands on the plain,
The votaries of vice, that late had bow'd
At Pride's high throne, and own'd her sway supreme.

So forth they march'd to taste the chearing air,
And next Lucifera's false Duess' rode,
Not so the Red-cross Knight, at distance he
Beheld their wanton sports all unapprov'd:
Fed with the pleasures of the balmy fields,
Home they fill'd (his brother lately slain,
The bold Sans-Foy) he seem'd to harbour wrath
And nourish vengeance in his bitter mind:
But when he saw the Red-cross Knight (whose Page
Bearing the shield of slain Sans-Foy, betray'd
Who slew his brother) instantly he leap'd
And snatch'd the warlike-ensign, but the Knight
Rescu'd the noble prey, and strait for war
They both prepar'd, and shook their glittering swords,
And clash'd their shields:  but the great queen forbad
All war that day, upon eternal pain
Of her displeasure, and the morrow fix'd
To end the high dispute in equal lists:
Then thus the infidel the queen address'd,
Pardon his rashness, who, thro' grief o'erleaps
The bounds of reason, shame to see this Knight
(No knight, but traitor of the foulest stamp)
Who slew the bravest knight that ever fought,
Even stout Sans-Foy, (Oh who can then refrain!)
Whilst he disdainful bears his flaming shield;
And, to increase the victory, behold
His dearest love, Fidessa, he detains
In traitorous vassalage; he detains her now,
But e'er tomorrow's noon, this vengeful arm
(Your royal favour granted) shall require
That brother's death, and render blood for blood.
Him shortly answer'd the true Red-Cross Knight,
He never meant to fight with words, but swords;
And as a sacred pledge his gauntlet threw,
Next morn by combat to decide the cause:
The night they pass'd in joy and jollity,
For Gluttony was steward of the feast,
And pour'd profuseness round; when nature tir'd
And worn out with excess, sought guilty rest,
Then Sloth conducted them to beds of ease.

Now when the coal-black curtains of old night
Had cover'd brightest sky, the warlike youths
In different rooms on drowsy couches laid,
'Gan meditate fit means of victory,
And false Duessa rising from her bed
To Sans-Joy comes in haste, whom thus she greets;
Ah dear Sans-Joy, next dearest to Sans-Foy,
Source of my hope, and cause of all my grief,
His image, so late slain by wicked foe
Revives my heart, Lo his Fidessa comes
To seek your grace!  to whom Sans Joy in few,
Say on the secret of th' labouring breast:
Then she in sighs, since first my heart was pierc'd
With love of him I mourn, I ne'er rejoic'd,
But for his farce endured num'rous woes,
At last, when I had fondly hop'd my joys
Were ripening quick, then was my much lov'd lord
By this deceiver slain, unworthy he
To wear his shield or hold Fidessa bound:
Yet now the clouds disperse, and light appears,
Under your beams I shall be safe from harm,
To you the inheritance of right belongs,
Let not your brother's ghost that vengeful calls
From Stygian shores implore your aid in vain:
Whereto Sans-Joy, fair lady nothing fear,
This valiant arm; shall sacrifice his blood,
And send his coward foul to darkest shades:
Oh but I fear, said she, the fate of war,
His arms and shield (they say) inchantments hold,
Nor was he ever forc'd to quit the field!
Then thus the angry knight in haste replied,
His valorous feats you need not now rehearse,
But hence and rest till morn then shall his corpse
Appease your rage the dowry of Sans-Foy
Shall too be yours:  Ah woe is me, she cry'd,
That is a double death, a sorrow new,
My proud foe's sight my troubles must increase,
Yet shall my secret aid still follow you.&mdash;
&mdash;Obedient she retir'd, nor more reply'd.
