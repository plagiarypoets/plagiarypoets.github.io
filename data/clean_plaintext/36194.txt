'Tis night!  the moon hath risen in the sky,
And some few stars that glimmer in the west
Look lovely out to bear her company&mdash;
While mortal man sinks to his bed of rest;
And thinks it luxury, and calls him blest,
And ever and anon as flits the gale,
Lo!  gentle sounds wing lightly on its breast,
Bringing to love's soft ear delicious tale,
The spirit-breathing song, the voice of nightingale.

And 'tis the hour, in true or fabled halls,
The merry imps beside the watery gleam,
Dance to the music of the water-falls,
Or hide in shadows of the moon's pale beam,&mdash;
So bards have sung in their poetic dream.
Delicious dream!  O!  if on earth there is
One precious drop amid life's troubled stream,
Shall give faint hues and colourings of bliss,
And wash its sorrows out &mdash; 'tis this &mdash; 'tis surely this!
