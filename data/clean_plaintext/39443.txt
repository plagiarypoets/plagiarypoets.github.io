And from the pray'r of want, and plaint of woe,
O never, never turn away thine ear!
Forlorn in this bleak wilderness below,
Ah!  what were man, should Heav'n refuse to hear!
To others do, (the law is not severe)
What to thyself thou wishest to be done:&mdash;
Forgive thy foes; and love thy parents dear;
And friends and native land:  nor these alone;
All human weal and woe learn thou to make thine own.
