Leave, Sisters, leave your hellish work,
(Cry'd Helda loud from Sussex cliffs)
No longer after Mischief lurk;&mdash;
At Hastings, see her plumes she lifts:
While darts and purpl'd jav'lins clear the way,
See &mdash; grim she sits, and smiles on Harold's natal day.

Haste, Sisters, haste, leave &mdash; leave your charms!
Haste &mdash; Haste &mdash; and join the Norman Song;
(Hark &mdash; boldly sung 'midst clash of arms)
Such bloody strains to you belong:&mdash;
'Twas Mischief's self inspir'd the deaf'ning lay,
And Hell its music lent &mdash; for Harold's natal day.

Seek, Sisters, now no bestial blood,
Haste, Haste, where human curses flow;
Like o'erwill'd Severn's roaring flood,
Gushing they spread &mdash; and roar with woe;
And 'midst their streams the meeting lances play,
And well-pleas'd Mischief laughs at Harold's natal day.

Seek, Sisters, now no nook obscene,
To hide from day your dark wove spells;
Here, not a ray of light is seen,
An arrowy cloud thro' aether swells.
Delighted Mischief guides the hurtling way,
And throws a blasting night o'er Harold's natal day.

Seek, Sisters, now no lion's heart,
Its gen'rous blood o'er charms to pour,&mdash;
Loud-woful whizz'd yon Norman dart&mdash;
And Harold pants in Harold's gore!
And see &mdash; the English fly &mdash; the Normans sway&mdash;
While Death and Mischief laugh at Harold's natal day.

Hark, Sisters, hark &mdash; while I foretell&mdash;
Joy to us thro' William's reign:
Joy to ev'ry tribe of Hell,&mdash;
For Harold's loss is Mischief's gain.
Towns sink for woods, and man to beast gives way!
Haste, and with Mischief laugh at Harold's natal day.
