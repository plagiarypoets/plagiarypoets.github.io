CANTO V.
ARGUMENT.
The mingled elves with magic dance,
Beguile the mazed train,
Oppression marks the stealing trance
To fix her galling chain.

"In narrow circle now the Fairy Muse,
Fatigu'd, her consummating labour bounds,
Yet no ignoble theme the nymph pursues,
Tho' never yet in rhyme or prose renown'd,
Tho' gentle Fletcher sports on magic ground,
And bays eternal crown his purple Isle,
Tho' mighty Spenser treads an ampler round,
And o'er his walk the choral virtues smile,
Yet be it mine to glean the remnant of their toil.

"The king of storms with cloudy curtains hung
The courts of heaven, and Circe's triumphs shar'd;
In gloomy pride the monarch swept along,
And meteors red his rising joy declar'd;
And now the sovereign of the winds unbarr'd
His stores again, and brew'd the potent flaw,
Soon to his beck the subject storms repair'd,
And girt the tyrant's throne with gloomy awe,
Awaiting from his voice th' exterminating law.

"Some he detach'd to sweep the Samoied shore,
And half the frosts of Norumbega bring,
Then sift their various plagues the island o'er,
And blast the verdant promise of the spring;
While some, commission'd by their awful king,
From far Cathaia boar the seeds of death,
And thro' the burden'd air incessant fling
Discolour'd plagues, that taint the vital breath,
And o'er the city hang the signs of heavenly wrath.

"Then all in haste, the superstitious crowd
Clamour'd their great deliverer to obey,
And on his Nymphs bestow his ashes vow'd,
If haply yet their rage they might allay;
For nature seem'd by signals to display
The Naiads' wrath and indignation fell;
Their's seem'd the vapours dim that veil'd the day,
Their anger seem'd the blust'ring storm to swell,
And load the moaning blast that swept the midnight dell.

"Twas then with gods averse, and led by fate,
Forth to the parent founts by turns repair
The delegated youths, in solemn state,
And round, with votive hymns and fervent prayer,
The baleful urn in long procession bear,
And lightly strew the consecrated spring
With hallow'd dust, or purge the tainted air
With mutter'd spells of power to check the wing
Of every baleful blast, that tends the stormy king.

"And soon by Vulcan's aid the fatal pile
They raise, above the consecrated spring;
By Vulcan's aid beneath the waters boil:
Soon from the seething lymph, on ardent wing,
The spirits of the deep arise, and fling
Their baleful umbrage o'er the swelling dome;
There round and round they hover, and they sing,
Then seek, by instinct led, their liquid home,
Where thro' the fatal vent th' infected waters foam.

"Nor seem'd their pious care bestow'd in vain
The ruffling storm a settled calm succeeds,
While o'er the slumb'ring earth and balanc'd main
Primeval peace his still procession leads,
No more by discord drawn to ruthless deeds,
Brother with brother met in civil broil,
No more aloft the lurid tempest breeds,
Nor hangs afflictive o'er the drooping isle,
Nor warring winds renew their elemental toil.

"Twas all th' extreme of sloth and torpid sleep,
The pulse but seem'd and scarcely seem'd to heave,
Nor wanted Morpheus with his dews to steep
The slumb'rous head, where fancy lov'd to weave
Her shadowy dreams of joy, that oft deceive
With visionary bliss the tortur'd mind,
The infant Arts were seen the strand to leave,
And to primeval Sloth the isle resign'd,
Banish'd to western climes, a luckier soil to find.

"Yet scarce they seem'd to feel their woeful plight,
So deadly deep the medicated flood
Empierc'd their brain, for still with new delight,
At morn and eve, the jocund train renew'd
The long, oblivious draught in mirthful mood,
Nor saw perdition lurk within the bowl;
Old Time with them a ling'ring truant stood,
And scarcely seem'd the lagging hours to roll,
Till the deep draught again had rous'd the torpid soul.

"Then all was rage, and mad, unruly mirth,
And clam'rous glee, and Bacchanalian song;
Scarce seem'd their veins to hold the rapt'rous birth
Of joy, that roll'd the sprightly tide along,
While Comus, overhead, triumphant hung
Ideal scenes, that seem'd with heaven to vie,
And bent to earth, the fond, adoring throng
Saw other suns illume another sky,
And floods of transport now their thrilling veins supply.

"Now ye that mark the images of things
In other worlds beyond the Cynthian sphere,
And dare to mount where inspiration flings
The veil aside, and shows her treasures near,
Ye that on fairy wing the minstrel bear
To scenes that scorn the silent lapse of time,
Whose tints unborrowed from the blooming year,
The poet steals to bless a nether clime,
Let no untimely blast deform my rustic rhyme,

"Permit my hand the heavenly form to trace,
And catch the hues of that Circaean band,
Who led astray with soft alluring grace,
Ogygia's sons, and gave the weeping land,
For many an age beneath the fair command
Of Freedom blest, to tyrant laws a prey.
Come sing with me, the visionary hand
That led the victims down the flow'ry way,
And hid his malice deep in shows of wanton play.

"First of the band, the orphan youths were seen,
The sons of him who fed the fun'ral fire,
Yet ere his blood distain'd the fatal green,
His last and dearest gift, their dying sire
Left in the royal charge; their quaint attire,
Their shape, their mien, the throng, admiring, gaz'd,
Whether the dance they form'd, or led the choir,
Still more and more the thoughtless crowd amaz'd,
Some recent mark of heaven among the minions trac'd.

"And not alone their heavenly semblance won
The veneration of th' unwary train,
But soon the young, dissembling tribe begun,
Compliance kind with each a part to feign,
Lur'd by their fatal art, the simple swain
Himself reflected saw, in every look,
They sympathiz'd alike with joy or pain,
With rapture smiling, or with sorrow struck,
And each capricious mood with mimic skill partook.

"Their fickle features chang'd with every eye,
And smil'd or sadden'd with the gazer's hue,
Like clouds that flit along an April sky,
And cheat, with transient gleams, the shepherd's view,
There lively drawn, the pining lover knew
His piteous look, and dull desponding mien,
E'en Envy dark, that ever looks askew,
Her semblance found, and that fantastic queen,
Wan Jealousy, that rolls an eye of sickly green.

"'Twas all delusion foul and Stygian art,
Bred by the mortal drug that ting'd the stream,
Whose secret fire consum'd th' unwary heart,
And the full soul inspir'd with love extreme,
Of those false youths that fed the wayward dream,
With baited looks enkindling deep delight,
Whene'er they disappeared, the blessed beam
Of morning shone in vain, and sober night
Seem'd all a dismal blank, without the social rite.

"Forgive me, Genius of the bleeding isle,
That dare the process of thy fate to sing,
No common artist wove the Stygian wile
Of pow'r, by gentlest stealth thy sons to bring
Beneath the sway of that tyrannic king,
Whose feigned obsequies thy ruin sped:
Forgive the Muse, whose yet unpractis'd wing,
Hovers around the theme with native dread,
Half aw'd by fear, and half by indignation led.

"The youths, oft mingling with the festive train,
For ever welcome and for ever gay,
With tales of wonders seen by land and main,
Stole their pleas'd audience from themselves away,
Scarce could they mark at eve the close of day,
Nor thro' the waning night the watches told,
By bold adventures lur'd, and dang'rous fray,
By east and west, of knights and chieftains bold,
Of India's pearly deep, and rocks enribb'd with gold.

"What joy to see the varying passions swell,
Flush in the cheek, and sparkle in the eye,
And oft the youths were urg'd again to tell
Of wond'rous things beneath another sky,
Beyond the burning line what spices fry,
How sport the zephyrs in the orange grove,
Where cupid boasts an easy victory,
Where brighter charms enkindle fiercer love,
And earthly pleasures vie with paradise above.

"While one the riches of the east display'd,
Another sung the terrors of the main,
Keen avarice seem'd to long, but fear, dismay'd,
Mark'd with a various hue the list'ning train;
A third with hope inspir'd the madding brain,
But Envy's dew his artful neighbour show'r'd.
Of barb'rous pomp that decks the solemn fane,
The public splendours, and the secret hoard,
He sung &mdash; the sick'ning ear his deadly theme devour'd.

"The sparks of rivalry another blew,
Enkindling strife, where friendship liv'd before,
As in close conf'rence with a favour'd few
He told the means to reach the golden shore,
The rest contemn'd, and pass'd neglected o'er,
Swol'n with revenge, and indignation sate,
Blind rage that scorn'd the cool conducting pow'r;
Of reason slow, and love of stern debate,
And sense of injur'd worth sublim'd the spreading hate.

"But soon the gentler passions took their sound,
And chang'd to softer notes the varied song,
Young Rapture smil'd, or tearful Pity mourn'd,
As softer magic led their souls along,
While link'd in social league, the loving throng,
With transient warmth eternal passion vow'd,
And round the blooming boys enraptur'd hung,
Who saw with joy the self devoted crowd
Invite the tingling snare, and call their bane aloud.

"Nor ceas'd the charm, when sunk in calm repose,
Reft of their cares, the willing victims lay,
With fancy'd tints the gaudy vision glows,
As busy sprites the countless wealth display,
Of Taprobana's coast, and rich Cathay,
Or wafted far before th' Atlantic gale,
Jocund they seem to chace the setting ray,
And reach the blessed isles with easy sail,
From smiling Fortune nam'd, and sung in ancient tale.

"Some thro' the deep'ning grove, or flow'ry meads,
With rising hope their dusky loves pursue,
While in the fancy'd fray another bleeds,
By rival hands, or sick'ning at the view,
Beholds the rival nymph her vows renew
With his worst foe, while, kindling, some aspire
To airy heights, and soon in dreams subdue
The coast that glows with Phoebus morning fire,
And where, at closing day, his weary steeds retire.

"And oft in longing past the sleepless night,
And oft in idle wish the hours of prime,
Still on the gaudy dream with fond delight
They hung, and measur'd oft the distant clime,
With all her stores on Fancy's wing sublime,
Tir'd of the past, intent on bliss to come,
And oft they chid the ling'ring pace of time,
Or wish'd the partial Fates had chang'd their doom,
And larger space allow'd to give their virtues room.

"But more, with hideous dreams of freedom lost,
The flaming town and desolated plain
For ever found their balmy slumbers cross,
When midnight stretch'd o'er all her silent reign,
The low laments was heard, or clanking chain,
And ominous conflict in the troubled air,
A fiery skirmish o'er the wide domain
Of aether spread, while Dian's waning star
Hid her diminish'd head, and seem'd to shun the war.

"Now to Religion's aid again they fly
In vain, their tainted rites abortive fail;
No fav'ring thunder breaks the sullen sky,
Nor bird with dexter wing was seen to sail
Propitious near, at length, with terror pale,
The foreign youths they call to give their aid,
Hoping heir sinless suit might yet prevail
To draw down blessings on each guilty head,
And from their dreams dispel the forms of nightly dread.

"Prompt at the call, the blooming youths obey,
And sweep around, in long procession join'd,
The solemn fane, with many a mystic lay,
Of power to calm the deep and check the wind.
Then all in haste the ready suppliants bind
Succinct their flow'ry stoles, and break away
In wildest dance, or mingling swift, entwin'd
In many a wanton maze their mystic play,
Like Creta's active sons on some distinguish'd day.

"Nor wanted hands to strike the sounding lyre,
Nor warbling flute the youthful blood to warm,
The magic modes their beating bosoms fire,
And spread from man to man the potent charm;
The full orchestra sounds the loud alarm,
The masquers spring aloof, and mingling meet,
Then foot to foot, and arm enlink'd in arm,
Traverse the floor with many an active feat,
Close their fantastic files, or wheel with swift retreat.

"The passion each had rais'd he still sustain'd,
And thro' the mystic scene its semblance bore,
First to strange notes, that seem'd by fear restrain'd;
Bewilder'd harsh around the ample floor
Pale Terror fled the sword athirst for gore,
While, lurking low, Remorse was seen behind,
Who, when the victim sunk to rise no more,
The conqu'ror seiz'd, and 'gan his limbs to grind
With stern convulsive pangs that seem'd to reach the mind.

"Compassion too was there, a gentle power,
Who still to each her kindly aid supply'd,
When Av'rice o'er his gold was seen to low'r
With haggard eye, and labour'd still to hide
The furtive ore; the melting maid apply'd
To the pale wretch, in vain himself to spare,
Her mild request the felon flung aside,
Tho, to the orphan's cry and widow's pray'r,
Soft-tun'd, a heavenly strain was heard to sooth the air.

But Pleasure, link'd with Luxury and Love,
Round the pale wretch in antic measure trode,
And ever as the mirthful maze they wove,
The trembling dotard and his cumb'rous load
They laugh'd to scorn, and oft the winged god
With smiles insidious led the wight astray;
Then back with fury to his foul abode
Dragg'd by Disdain, he curst the luckless day
That led him, far unfit, to join their wanton play.

"Again, to calm their souls, the dark disguise
The dancers chang'd to a seraphic tune;
For dazzling robes, the tissue of the skies;
There seeming Friendship, like a summer noon,
Smil'd lovely, as he dealt the sacred boon
Of Sympathy, in nectar steep'd, around
To many a parched lip:  the pleasing swoon,
By False Religion breath'd, their senses bound,
While Virtue's mimic train their nodding temples crown'd.

"But soon the heav'nly measure sunk away,
Gradual, exchang'd for sounds of sullen mood,
And tragic notes, commission'd to allay
Young Hope, and freeze at once the rising flood
Of gen'ral mirth; in vain the choirs renew'd
With sickly stop the baffled Lydian strain:
Perplex'd the dance, and mute the warblers stood,
And all unseemly mixt, the sportive train
Strove to resume their posts, but seem'd to strive in vain.

"Fell Envy here with Emulation strove,
There Pride the spreading flame portentous blew,
While loud, discordant music breath'd above,
Like Eurus' pipe, that swells the storm anew.
Pale Av'rice lurk'd among the madding crew,
And seem'd himself and precious charge to wail,
His native colour chang'd to earthly hue,
While wild conflicting tides by turns assail
The tott'ring wretch, and round their reckless fury deal.

"But Envy from the band unheeded stole,
And near a neighbouring altar fixt her flight,
To mark what various flaws the tide control,
What various passions rose and sunk to night;
Till at the moment fixt, the wrathful sprite,
Wav'd her pale signal thro' the troubled air;
Soon arms were seen to flash a baleful light,
And trumpets' clang was heard, and wild despair
With flight and tumult join'd, deplor'd the waste of war.

"The desolating band Ambition led,
With meteor crest and limbs of giant mold,
The festive troop recoil'd with sudden dread,
From his stern eye that wither'd e'en the bold:
Swift at the glance his glittering bands unfold,
And sweep around the prey with steady ring,
The fainting suppliants by their fears control'd,
Sink at the summons of the greedy king,
While Conscience adds her plagues, and aims her secret sting.

"A second signal mark'd the mourners' fate,
While to a funeral strain advancing slow;
The dread enclosing band deny retreat,
And meditate the long descending blow;
The feeble suppliants sink before the foe,
And feel before it comes the threat'ning sword,
While Av'rice wails with shrill, distinguish'd woe,
And tries with trembling hands to save his hoard,
Clings to his precious charge, and supplicates their lord.

"But now a sprightlier strain was heard to breathe,
And every chord the minstrel Bard awoke,
No more the clarion pour'd the note of death,
No more the suppliants bow'd beneath the stroke;
But all at once in wild meander broke,
Victors and vanquish'd, o'er the changing scene,
And joy above her purple pinions shook,
Blythe Hope was there succinct in amice green,
And Concord struck a league the warring powers between.

"Then all at once from wire and string combin'd,
Melodious blending with the vocal sound,
A mellow mingled strain was heard behind;
The solemn organ fill'd the temple's bound,
Nor yet the lyre's sweet modulations crown'd;
The jocund horn, the pipe, the viol fill
The concert deep, that reach'd the heavenly round,
Where sharp and sweet commixt with magic skill,
And soft and sprightly airs a mingled charm instill.

"The jolly masquers hear with wonder new,
And in a double line their bands extend,
Then matching all in pairs the motley crew,
At once their chequer'd troops amusive blend;
Sorrow with Joy, a new adopted friend,
And Hope with Fear, the mystic measure tread,
Soft Pity deigns her lily hand to lend
To stately Pride, and Love exulting led
Fell Hate, that struggling, seem'd to turn her sickly head.

"Then stern Ambition led with Luxury,
Her victim late, a labyrinthine round,
The feeble partner strove her hand to free
From his strong grasp, and beat the trembling ground
With stagg'ring step, and feet by Terror bound;
And close to Av'rice link'd, Profusion gay
Fantastic smil'd, while oft the miser frown'd,
And wept his stores that there abandon'd lay,
By his associate hung around in wanton play.

"Scorn seiz'd on Shame, but Shame recoiling fled,
And tim'rous sculk'd among the festive crew,
His mate pursued, but still a secret dread
Freed the mute trembler from his grasp anew:
Thus fir'd by fits the merry madness grew,
And sunk by fits as breath'd the magic blast,
The audience hail'd with shouts the wond'rous view,
And ever wish'd the magic scene to last,
Nor saw, by charms entranc'd, the future in the past.

"And now the self devoted victims raise
A wider theatre, the pomp to hold;
(Thus Athens in her last luxurious days,
On scenic pleasures spent her hoarded gold,
Profuse, by hollow friends to slavery sold)
Here, lofty Peristyles the wall surround,
And shining valves the ample space unfold,
Where, rang'd on seats, with bending arches crown'd,
Ogygia's longing tribes possess the ample bound.

"No vulgar hand had pictur'd on the roof,
The solemn scenes of an autumnal sky,
Where light and shade with mixt, fantastic woof,
Seem'd o'er the umber'd firmament to vie;
In rival art to cheat the gazer's eye,
With soft commingling hues that scape the sight,
Lest the devoted multitude should spy
The fraud too soon, by clear detecting light,
And save them from the snare, by force or timely flight.

"And now again the moody music blows,
And now again begins the merry dance,
And now they disunite, and now they close,
Now o'er the stage retreat, and now advance,
Quick as the meteors of the north that glance
Around the pole, or skim the welkin sheen;
The audience seem enwraps in blissful trance
At times, and each Elysian pause between
Loud shouts, and thund'ring hands applaud the jocund scene.

"From shore to shore the wonders of the sight
Were spread at large, and millions throng'd to see
The mystic show, with ever new delight,
Unconscious led to meet their destiny
For now the train, secure of victory,
With added charms their final ruin plann'd,
Nor fear'd to pay with blackest injury,
The kindness of the self-devoted band,
Where late a naked crew they reach'd the welcome strand.

"Still on the mem'ry dwelt the wond'rous day,
Present or absent still the magic spread,
Thro' Pleasure's mask the passions made their way,
By wonder nurst, and lengthen'd habit fed;
The oft returning pomp devoid of dread
They saw, and while they drank the living bane,
Within the deep reflected image bred,
And corresponding hues began to stain,
Oft as the scen'ry chang'd, the deep infected brain.

"Each Passion in its turn instinctive flam'd
By magic blown, and touch'd with kindred fire,
Reason expell'd, no more the tumult tam'd,
And Pride, and rankling Hate, and strong Desire,
Each in her native semblance shone entire,
And still new force the living stream supply'd;
Where mix'd of old the ashes of the sire,
And many a tainted stem that drank the tide,
And many a waving crop their secret force ally'd.

"Short and fallacious were their joys, for soon
The Stygian masquers dropp'd their fair disguise,
And, ranging to a loud Tartarean tune,
Display'd the features of the nether skies.
Now hideous forms on ev'ry side arise,
And threat, with savage looks, their trembling prey;
Each with Demonian glee his victim eyes,
Their victims stand in horrible dismay,
Irresolute alike to fly or stand at bay.

"A dragon there, voluminous and vast,
Shoots forth his dreadful length, to light reveal'd,
And clasping round his prey, secure and fast,
Keeps him awhile in deadly durance held,
Till all the poison in his veins conceal'd,
Transfus'd through ev'ry faculty, possess
His inmost soul, by social love unquell'd,
And ev'ry look and ev'ry act confest
Envy, a bosom plague, a dire, unsated guest.

"Another like a burning meteor flies,
Crossing the welkin in a summer's night,
And smites the man, till all his marrow fries
With foul concupiscence of low delight:
He longs to join the deep Circean rite,
And emulate the tenants of the sty,
And, all unconscious of his evil plight,
Forgets his lineage from the world on high,
And reckless liv'd of Blame or Scorn's retorted eye.

"O pride of Caledon!  Milesian youth!
I see your sentence with prophetic eye;
Tho' well ye knew the gen'ral breast to soothe,
Or fire by turns with noblest minstrelsy.
I see you round the ample circus fly,
Each by a seeming Muse of fire pursu'd,
And now ye rest, and now again ye try
A sportive strain, or chant in mournful mood,
Then sink in fitful pangs, by Circe's charms subdu'd.

"Another, by a cold torpedo struck,
Felt the cold venom through his frame dispread,
His lither limbs relaxt, and vacant look,
Shews the pure flame, by spark aethereal fed,
And all its energies for ever fled;
His mournful plight his haggard friends deplore,
But mourn not long, for now, with rising dread,
The hunter's horn, and loud, discordant roar,
Gives signal to the chace, and fast they fly before.

"Springing with savage ramp, and burning eyes,
An herd of tigers leads the chace along;
Each at his long devoted victim flies,
Who falls not, but with kindred fury stung
The hunters join, and on the flying throng
His vengeance sates with unextinguish'd ire:
Still, at the venom'd bite, the love of wrong,
Malice, and deep revenge, and keen desire
Of discord rages round, like propagated fire.

"And still, at stated times, around the shore
The periodic devastation spreads,
When the recruited bands are ripe once more
To give to penance their devoted heads
For Naiad rites abus'd; and hark!  the meads
And pendent woods return the coming cry!&mdash;
I too must join the hunt, when Vengeance leads,
For of that sad society am I,
Condemn'd at fated times to lead the chace or fly."

A sound was heard, but not Diana's horn,
And troops were seen, but not of rural Thanes,
That mount the russet hills at dawn of morn,
To chase the village prowler o'er the plains;
But this was like those wild Tartarean strains
Breath'd by Alecto when she woke the fight:
The wretch, sagacious of his coming pains,
Through the wild woods precipitates his flight&mdash;
The victims of his fraud pursue, and claim their right.
