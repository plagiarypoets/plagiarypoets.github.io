Come, gentle Muse of Pity, bring thy lute
Of soothing sound!  A scene of tender woe
Demands thy song!  If e'er thy throbbing breast,
Still kindly heaving with the frequent sigh
For others sad Calamity, did make
The tomb of youthful Merit, early snatch'd
From the keen eye of Hope, thy tuneful theme!
If e'er thy soft harmonious soul, infus'd
In melting number, from the tearful eye
Of groaning Anguish, stole the falling Woe,
And from the Parent's bleeding bosom drew
The goring shaft, &mdash; here may thy sacred art
The pious work perform! &mdash; or if thou can'st
Wipe off the stains of Grief from Beauty's cheek,
And, like the genial Sun, disperse the mist
From nature's fairest blooms, and give their charms
Back to the eye of Rapture! &mdash; to thy fane
Lovers shall bow, and altars rise to thee!
For, ah!  the youthful subject of my lay,
Adonis-like, by this untimely fate,
Has dim'd bright Beauty's beam!  Sweet, hapless Youth!
What now avails thy form, so fram'd for love,
So soft, and graceful! &mdash; What, thy gentle air!
Where hid beneath the unasuming veil
Of candid Modesty, from Envy's glance
Thy Merit sought [illegible] &mdash; but in vain!
Where wast thou, Phoebus, and the tuneful Nine!
Where were ye, when your lov'd fav'rite Son,
Sunk in the fatal wave?  Could ye not charm,
With those resistless pow'rs with which ye deign'd
In [illegible] magic strains, the outstrech'd hand
Of [illegible]?  Or could you not, as erst,
By [illegible], Orpheus, call him back
From the drear shades of Death! &mdash; O, had he liv'd!....
