She looks within the mirror; and her form
Is from its dazzling crystal given again
In living beauty; &mdash; yet a hue less warm
Reddens the lip; &mdash; the blue, pellucid vein
Wanders across a brow where silent pain
Sheds paleness on its polished ivory.
The ruby of that cheek has felt the stain
Of tears, that flow'd unseen by human eye
As from her pillow rose her midnight prayer &mdash; to die!

And so she died, &mdash; in early beauty died;
A violet, by its first soft shower decayed;
A flush of radiance on life's changing tide;
Just seen and loved, and lost in evening's shade,
A young sweet star, just risen but to fade;
And this fair image smiling in sad bloom
On her, so soon in quiet to be laid,
Looks like her Angel, in its meekness come,
To tell her of the tomb &mdash; her calm, her hallowed tomb.
