Thou wert a monarch once, no doubt, but now
Thy reign is o'er, thy day of strength hath fled;
For thou hast, long since, lost each verdant bough
That lifted to the sky its lofty head:
Yet art thou, lacerated tree instead
More honour'd far, than in thy living hour,
For nations gaze upon thee, and they read
A wond'rous tale of nature's plastic power,
Display'd in thee, great tree, tho' shown in humblest flower.

An hundred lustres since, perchance, or more,
Heaven sent on thee its vivifying dew:
Long ere Columbus sought the western shore
With crazy vessel, and with trembling crew,
Thy trunk, ungazed upon by white man, grew;
And dingy hunter, when the day was past,
Beneath thy spreading limbs his gaunt form threw,
In confidence he there his body cast,
Unfear'd the white man's arts, unfelt the wintry blast.

Perchance a wond'rous tree, thou then wert named,
And copper men assembled 'neath thy boughs;
And thou wert, in their recollections, famed
For rites nocturnal, or for gay carouse,
Or council fire, or interchange of vows
'Tween rival tribes, or famed for loud applause
Bestow'd on "talking" chief, who dared espouse
The cry of "war," and, 'neath thy limbs, to cause
Ten thousand whoops to rise from warriors and their squaws.

For many a circling year thou might'st have thriven
In all thy native majesty, alone,
Thy top might yet aspiring point to heaven,
And thou for coming ages be unknown,
But enterprise, of late, hath wanton grown,
New rivers rise beneath her magic wand,
Rocks melt away, and failing forests own
Her power that blesses all the teeming land,
And thou, huge tree, thy soil did'st leave, at her command.

And thou wilt go to Europe, and wilt tell
That thou, to freedom's soil, thy birth dost owe;
Thou wilt not fail to bear thine honours well,
And shame the shrubs that in the old world grow.
To Albion's isle, to Gallia's coast thou'lt go,
And royalty will doubtless gaze on thee,
And thou, if tongue thou had'st, might let it know
That nature revels in the land that's free,
And there her greatness shows, in man, or stream, or tree.
