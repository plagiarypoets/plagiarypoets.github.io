Yes, treach'rous Despot!  (for no milder name
Thy perfidy deserves) the flimsy veil
That, for a season, mask'd thy secret aim,
Is now withdrawn.  Yon hapless Captives feel
The full effect of all thy boasted zeal
For public equity and private right!
The Hypocrite no longer can conceal
His lurking enmity and smother'd spite&mdash;
His moderation glares in its true light,
Filling indignant Europe with surprise!
But Albion's Falcons, now upon the flight,
Shall soon the Vulture's violence chastise.
Fear not, ye unprotected and ye weak!
'Tis not on you her vengeance she will wreak.
