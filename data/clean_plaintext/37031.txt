The sons of business have appointed hours,
In which to show their various merchandise;
And whether heaven is gay or dark with showers,
The shivering shop-boy meets the passer's eyes
Opening at six; at weary eve, likewise,
The clock's obeyed; but Fancy doth not so:
Sometimes, all careless of th' inviting skies,
She dreams upon her couch, 'till Fortunes blow
Bids her awake, the world and all its scenes to know.

Then doth she buckle her bright armour on,
And seize the magic circle of her shield,
Painted with dreams, and forms of actions gone,
And scattering doubtful light along the field:
Conscious where'er she steps the world must yield,
Her moody pranks are strange at first, and wild,
Till taught by falls and blows her arms to wield
No longer like a merry heedless child,
She walks where patient Art his landmarks true has piled.

But whether she shall wake or late or soon,
Is left to Fortune, Nature hath not said;
Sometimes she walks in darkness, like the moon
When earth's dusk shadow o'er her face is spread;
But oftener still, like lamps among the dead,
Her light she lifts on high where none observe,
When, though the fiery radiance wide is shed,
The beauteous torch-bearer no end doth serve,
But gilds unheeding clay that leaves her lone to starve.

But genius sometimes lingers in the rear
Of youth, and walks, a man, upon the stage
With giant port, and footstep void of fear,
And breast close-armed against the shafts of rage;
And like a mighty wrestler does engage
With stern renown, and bear away the prize
To grace his honoured brows when feeble age
Has damped his energy, and shrunk his size,
And dimmed the rays of soul that sparkled from his eyes.
