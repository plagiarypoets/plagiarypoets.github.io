Alas!  my poor native domain,
Now vanish'd for ever from me;
Condemn'd in these deserts to reign,
I ne'er shall look back upon thee.

The clock from the neighbouring tow'r
Was wont to respond to its round,
Was wont to re-echo the hour,
And deal its fleet moments by sound.

But here rears no temple its head,
No moss crowns the mouldering wall,
No pray'r is rehearsed o'er the dead,
Nor decency throws on the pall.

No knell flings its summons on high,
Or wafts to a purer abode,
Or, when Omai is summon'd to die,
Commends his remains to his God!

Had honesty drawn back this hand,
Or piety beam'd on this breast,
I ne'er had been torn from my land,
And William might still have been blest.

My infant had still climb'd my knee,
And innocence dawn'd on its smile;
Him fortune forbids me to see,
Condemn'd to a tenantless soil.

If death bears its breath to repose
In the flattering dawn of its day,
Its eyes I'm forbidden to close,
And shed my regret on its clay.

How happy the man who can find
Contentment a native delight!
'Tis the sanative spring of the mind,
'Tis a fruit which no tempest can blight.

He ne'er will despond on a spot
So rugged, so barren as mine;
He ne'er will re-echo his lot
To the savage, the rock, and the pine;

For they who partook in my fate
Have forsaken my presence, and fled;
Reflexion ne'er wept at their state,
Or conscience in penitence bled.

Farewell, ye gay pleasures, which gave
Your shadowy joys to my youth!
With sorrow I sink to the grave,
So flattery differs from truth.

With me let my country condole,
Let my family sigh a farewell,
Till (if mercy may visit my soul)
In happier climes we may dwell.

There Peace shall display her white wand,
Compassion shall blot out the tear,
And somewhat employ my weak hand
More bless'd than hath call'd for it here.
