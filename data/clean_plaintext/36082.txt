TO MAN.
Lord of the terrene globe!  majestic man!
In ev'ry age and ev'ry clime renown'd,
Fain in my verse thy nature would I scan,
But, ah!  what thought can trace thee, though profound;
In depths of vice and misery art thou drown'd,
Tho' godlike smiles adorn thy angel face,
Tho' here and there with art and science crown'd,
And, by Religion call'd, the child of Grace;
Despotic Power shakes over thee his mace,
And Superstition spreads her toils for thee:
Scarce on this ample globe is found a place
Where thou may'st be from thy tormentors free.
Then, vaunting man!  behold thyself a slave,
Tho' bless'd with beauty, wealthy, wise, and brave!

TO CIVILIZATION.
Civilization beams along the earth!
Angel of light!  I mark thee in the gloom,&mdash;
For Heav'n permits once more thy mortal birth!
To man prophetic of a nobler doom.
Erst in old Greece, and in majestic Rome,
For liberty, for arts and arms renown'd,
Mankind beheld thee for a season bloom,
Only to sink in darkness more profound.
Despotic power o'erstepp'd thy flaming mound,
Fell Superstition quench'd thy living fire,
Barbaric Ignorance dash'd thee to the ground,
And thou, midst falling empires, didst expire!
But now the nations hail thee from afar,
Of deathless Liberty the morning star!
