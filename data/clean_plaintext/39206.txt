Ah Mira!  you flatter the swain,
You tell him his numbers are sweet,
You say (and 'tis that makes him vain)
That the virgins his verses repeat.

For is there a shepherd, sweet maid!
Who loves not the praise of the fair?
Let him fly to the yew's darkest shade,
And chant his dull songs to despair.

For me I'll ne'er covet renown,
But that which the fair can bestow,
And should they once cruelly frown,
No longer my verses should flow.

But Mira, your tribute of praise,
To Damon can never belong,
For rude are the strains he can raise,
And careless, in sooth, is his song.

Nor can he, fair damsels, pretend
To the merit you give the design;
Nay, Mira, he'll boldly contend,
Much more of that merit is thine.

For as in an ominous hour
His thanks to the muse he address'd,
Because it was then in his pow'r,
Fond wish!  to relieve the distress'd:

"Ah, be not conceited, she said,
Nor think all the merit thy own,
The tribute of praise must be paid
To thy kind-hearted readers alone.

"And boast not too much of thyself;
To them shall my thanks be exprest,
For they to the poor give their pelf,
You words, which are trifles at best."

But since my dear Mira approves
The humble attempts of her swain,
Fond Echo shall tell thro' the groves,
Sweet note!  that she sung not in vain.

Her strains, when the shepherds shall hear,
With me their kind efforts they'll join,
The hearts of th' afflicted to chear,
For Mira approves the design.

The gods then shall fondly look down
With a smile on Britannia's lov'd coast,
Bestowing the palm of renown
On those whose kind hearts give the most.
