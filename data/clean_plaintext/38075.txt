Here, 'midst the spoils august, that hoary Time
Throws o'er the scene which whilom smil'd so gay;
Whilst here the Poet tunes his artless rhyme,
And points with moral truth the Doric lay;

Lo!  to his eyes majestic forms appear,
The mail-clad warriors of the days of old;
Heroes who hurl'd with manly force the spear,
Matrons resplendent in their robes of gold;

"O say what purpose," they with zeal demand,
"Attracts thy steps to these fast mould'ring walls;
What gen'rous purpose activates thy hand,
Or to thy pious ear what sainted spirit calls?"

To rescue from oblivion's dreary page,
Heroes, who rose sublime among their peers;
To sing the chieftains of a martial age,
To shed o'er Kath'rine's urn a flood of tears.

For this the Bard, when silence reigns around,
Quits the soft pillow of inglorious rest;
And 'midst these tow'rs oft hears the solemn sound,
The martial murm'rings of the brave opprest.

No more these walls with minstrelsy resound,
The gaudy pageants of a distant day;
But here the bat and moping owl are found,
And mould'ring turrets intercept the way.

"Enough," they cry'd, "thou tread'st on classic ground,
Thou paint each portrait with the pen of truth;
And shew th' admiring world that gaze around,
Kath'rine the mourning bride, and Arthur hapless youth.

"Or, if from those to days of brighter hue
Thy heart shall lead thee to attune the praise,
O'er Britain's Prince thy choicest chaplets strew,
And consecrate to George's heir the Muse's purest lays."
