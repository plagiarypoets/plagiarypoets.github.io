Well fare thy tender Muse, thou tuneful swain,
Who pour'd from pity's fount the plaintive song,
Soothing as LYTTELTON'S love-prompted strain,
To heal that bosom which hath bled too long.
Sure Heav'n in mercy did thy muse inspire,
To mitigate his grief, and quench affliction's fire.

Nor thou, bright Excellence, that offering scorn,
That hallow'd offering of a soul sincere;
But hov'ring, deign, on cherub's wing up-born,
To mark with friendly smile the grateful tear.
And thou, forgive me, if I too presume,
To cast one pensive look on her lamented tomb.

For, ah!  too well my sympathizing soul,
Can image in herself that weight of woe,
Which reason vainly struggles to controul,
In thy sad heart thus lonely left below.
Too well she paints the pangs of parting love,
So late depriv'd, alas!  of her own turtle dove.

Yet why lament?  tho' Death's strong doors be barr'd,
And Fate inexorable claim his prize:
Who will complain that HEAV'N'S decrees are hard,
If soon we meet for aye in yonder skies.
Departed friends, alas!  return no more,
Yet we may join them on some happier shore.

But whither soar'st thou, weak, unwitting muse,
The blissful regions of the saints to sing;
O check thy flight, and apter numbers chuse;
Such daring heights demand a seraph's wing.
Enough for her the world this truth can tell,
Well did she live whom &mdash; sung so well.
