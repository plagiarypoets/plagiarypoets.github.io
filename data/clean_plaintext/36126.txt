Twilight was in the chamber, yet the flame,
That burned around the Sun's descending throne,
In one long splendour thro' the casement came,
Tinging the sofa's silk, the Parian stone,
The picture's sculptured frames, that partial shone
Thro' that rich dusk around the hues divine
By MIND upon the Italian canvas thrown;
Like the gold pillars of an Eastern mine,
At once the Indian's cave of gems, and holy shrine.

The beams swept round, 'till its full glory fell
Upon an idol's, yet a woman's form:
She sate ungazing, as if some high spell
Had on her bright eye fixed the sudden charm:
A half-hued picture lay beneath her arm,
That paused, suspense above it, like a ray;
Her opening lip &mdash; her delicate cheeck seem'd warm
With more than sunset's fires, till parting day
Veil'd her in purple shades, and all sank soft away.
