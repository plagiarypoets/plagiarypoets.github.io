Accomplish'd Peer!  whose honouring footsteps tread
Where bards and heroes wing'd their tranced hours,
Round Sidney's brow thou hast engarlanded
A coronal of such verse-woven flowers
As he was wont, amid Arcadian bowers,
To wreathe in anademes of asphodel;
While Colin's fancy blent its faery powers,
To win the grace of matchless Astrophel.
Ah!  soothing to the spirit 'tis to know
That noble hands entwine the Muse's meed,
That noble hearts, by their according glow,
Stamp highest guerdon on heroic deed,&mdash;
And sooth it is to own, that Thurlow's name
With Spenser and with Sidney grasps acclaim.
