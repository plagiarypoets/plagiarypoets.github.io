Fiction has sung that in the wild
Desarted Una lay,
Whose eyes could look e'en Tygers mild,
Whose voice made Wolves obey.

The painter caught the poet's fire&mdash;
And Tygers, sporting mild,
With Wolves, in Kaufmann's tints admire
Blithe Spenser's fancied child.

But &mdash; when next on Una's face
Your pencil's power you try,
Let not each feature and each grace
Angelica supply:

But, by a Mirror's faithful aid,
With nice attention draw
From model of thyself, sweet maid!
A form without a flaw.

At sight of which, tho' no fierce brood
(Infringing Nature's laws,)
Of Tygers fawn and leave their food,
A Lion's roar applause;

Yet, which from reasonable men
Shall admiration claim,
And which the pencil and the pen
Shall consecrate to fame.
