To thee, O Moina!  dearest sister, friend,
Beguiler sweet of many a toilsome day
Of mental pain, who oft time didst extend
Bright Fancy's wing, perchance to chase away
The lowering shades of loathed misery;
Or madest my bosom's grief so much thine own,
For self I ceased to weep and mourned for thee;
And as thou echoedst back the heart's deep groan,
Deceived, almost could deem I wept for thee alone!
