Oh, thou pale, snowy rosebud, though rent and laid low
By the rude hand of Power in the day of despair,
Yet thou still in the breasts of the loyal shalt blow,
Full as lovely, as fragrant, as fresh, and as fair.
Though our bosoms no longer may glow with the dream
Of royalty righted, and exiles restored,
Yet still they may swell with the rapturous theme
Of the faith they long cherished, the prince they adored;
And still they in silence may weep o'er the woes
Endured by the chieftains who bore the white rose.

With that deep thrilling interest, where pleasure and pain
Contend in the bosom and struggle for sway,
We muse on the emblem of Loyalty vain,
And sigh o'er its fall on Culloden's dark day:
Yet the cloud that o'ershadowed the dawning so bright,
And obscured with its darkness the valley and heath,
With the beam of the meteor flashed radiance and light,
And illumed with its splendour the pale field of death,
And bright o'er the fallen its lustre arose,
And hallowed their sufferings, their valour and woes.

Oh, still whilst our bosoms shall glow with the flame,
Which Heaven itself in its mercy inspired,
Shall awaken each thrill as it dwells on the fame
Of the heroes so loyal, devoted, admired.
And still the loved emblems of loyalty true
Shall honoured and blest in our bosoms remain,
And whilst its white blossoms we pensively view,
We behold no dishonour, or sully, or stain;
And ages to come shall admiring disclose,
The virtues and fame of the pure, snowy rose.
