Chief of all wealth earth's secret womb contains,
Sparkle the diamonds of GOLCONDAN mines,
Chief of all produce, from her cultur'd plains,
Flow the rich liquors of BERGUNDIAN vines;
And CHIEF OF VIRTUES of the human soul
Impartial JUSTICE shines, whose strict controul
Preserving order, and supporting law,
Holds minds, that wish not to rebel, in willing awe!

Down from the glittering nail his Dorian lyre
If PINDAR took, and felt th' inspiring flame,
If at his call repair'd t' Aonian choir
To praise some victor of the Olympic game,
Shall not slight conquests on the dusty field
To sage decrees of truth and wisdom yield?
Round THERON'S brows shall laureate honours twine,
And not, O KENYON!  equal eulogies be thine?

If true the purport of this SABINE strain
"The MUSE FORBIDS THE VIRTUOUS MAN TO DIE,"
If verse can still its wonted power maintain,
And grant the meed of IMMORTALITY;
Now that all hopes of warlike trophies fall,
While North and South the GALLIC arms prevail,
Yet nobler triumphs shall the MUSE proclaim,
And crown INTERIOR WORTH with wreaths of lasting fame!

GUARDIAN of MORALS!  whose presiding voice
Awful is heard in these degenerate times,
No foul adulterers shall in lust rejoice,
No titled gamblers varnish snares and crimes;
Thine equal eye shall mark the crafty peer,
And, train'd to fraud, the villain auctioneer;
Life, honour, property, tho' Heav'n bestow,
To thee and thy compeers their safe delights we owe!

For this, while annals can embalm the past,
Perennial with the WISE and GOOD be found
Thy name, through long posterity to last,
While future JUDGES kindle at the sound!
Thus shall that name remain like SOLON'S great,
Who, mild yet firm, reform'd th' ATHENIAN state,
Or his who, scornful of inglorious rest,
Form'd to severer toils each manly SPARTAN breast!

Nor let this PLAUSIVE STRAIN thine ear offend!
SATIRE'S strong bolt the MUSE at will can throw,
And she, perchance, no vulgar aid shall lend
To bring opprobrious GUILT'S proud vauntings low;
She knows to deal her vengeance round the land
On each bold vice that dares thy power withstand,
She crimes can scourge, impervious to the LAWS,
And, leagu'd with HEAV'N, and Thee, assert fair VIRTUE'S cause!
