Consign'd to mingle with his parent earth,
His name in distant lands will ne'er be known;
Dull apathy presided at his birth,
And ignorance mark'd the infant for her own.

Confined within the workhouse' lofty wall,
When time revolving brought a holiday,
Elated, he obeyed the festive call,
And sallied forth with shreds of ribbands, gay.

Soldiers, at wake or fair, he lov'd to meet,
Their martial trophies view'd without a fear;
And when in gay parade they pass'd the street,
With shouting boys he follow'd in the rear.

On batter'd water-pot in lieu of drum,
With varied measure beat the loud tattoo;
Press'd through the crowd, regardless of its hum,
Nor would his clattering melody forego.

When wrangling blockheads, for contention ripe,
Disturb'd with clam'rous din the evening's cheer;
Unmindful of the noise, he smok'd his pipe,
Or bade the waiter fill his mug with beer.

While thus abroad unwittingly he stray'd,
The love of freedom in his bosom burn'd;
The lapse of time unconscious he survey'd,
Nor to his dwelling willingly return'd.

When prying scouts explor'd his snug retreat,
Unvex'd by cares that reasoning mortals goad;
Reluctant then, they forc'd him from his seat,
And loud reproaches urg'd him on the road.

As thus through life he ran his even course,
Still unillum'd by reason, heavenly guide,
He scap'd the piercing stings of keen remorse,
For virtue wrong'd, or talents misapply'd.

Impartial death, that levels all below,
Nor spares the conqueror's wreath, nor monarch's crown;
Aim'd at his breast the inevitable blow,
To mix in dust with names of high renown.

When o'er his bier the solemn knell had toll'd,
Near the dull spot where he was wont to dwell;
Consign'd to mingle with his kindred mould,
His friends attendant sigh'd a last farewell.
