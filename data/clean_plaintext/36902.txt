The bark departs &mdash; but still within our view,
The russet roof, or glitt'ring steeple bright,
Seem lengthen'd shadows on the sky of blue,
And gradual dark'ning hover on our sight:&mdash;
Yet serve with momentary glance to give,
A ling'ring, longing glimpse of spot well known;
Where some lov'd friends, or beauteous maiden live,
A youthful bud and scarce in ripeness blown;
Blent with the glance a wish to call that bud thy own.

The bark departs &mdash; but not to eye is given,
To scan the scene our former glances told:
Sinks in horizon bounding earth and heaven,
Gay roofs and towering steeples burnish'd gold;
Yet not the thought; &mdash; on mem'ry moulded deep,
The sweet impression's there for ever borne:
Oh!  if thou lov'st, wakeful or in thy sleep,
Of parting scenes the sweeten'd thoughts return!
Ne'er let thy precious treasure from thy soul be torn.

But ah!  with them in fashion's round,
Quickly you're flatter'd, then as quick forgot;
Beneath their smiles more graceful faces bound,
In Lethe's depths, you quickly are forgot.
A picture true mark yonder sparkling wave,
Flashing the silv'ry globules of its crest;
Plays round the vessel's bow, its timbers leave,
Rebounding gradual falls and strikes to rest;
Is soon replac'd by one as bright in sparkles drest.
