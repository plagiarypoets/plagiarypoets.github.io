Since Emma the perfect is flown
To the regions of permanent rest,
Perversely will Colinet moan,
And wish the dear Seraph unblest?

What tho' she were pride of the plain,
What tho' she were queen of the dance;
What tho' she gave joy to the swain,
And rivalled the flowers of romance?

The fair one forsook with a smile
The pleasures that once she held dear:
For Colinet these are but vile,
Compar'd with a bliss more sincere.

What tho' she were joy to your heart,
What tho' she were light to your eye;
What tho' the kind Fair would impart
Each rapture, each tear, and each sigh?

The end of her pilgrimage here,
Was to fit her for mansions of bliss;
Then indulge not the murmuring tear,
Nor lament such an exit as this.

Since Emma the peerless is flown
To the regions of permanent rest,
Perversely should Colinet moan&mdash;
He has not a wish to be blest.
