Here rests his head upon the lap of earth
One nor to Fortune nor to Fame unknown;
Fair Science frown'd not on his humble Birth,
And smooth-tongued Flattery mark'd him for her own.

Large was his wish &mdash; in this he was sincere,
Fate did a recompence as largely send,
Gave the poor C&mdash;r four hundred pounds a year
And made a dirty minister his friend.

No further seek his deeds to bring to light
For, ah!  he offer'd at Corruption's shrine;
And basely strove to wash an Aethiop white,
While Truth and Honour bled in every line!
