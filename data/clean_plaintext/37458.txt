Faunus, who lov'st to chase the light-foot Nymphs,
Propitious guard my fields and sunny farm,
And nurse with kindly care
The promise of my flock.

So to thy pow'r a Kid shall yearly bleed,
And the full bowl to genial VENUS flow;
And on thy rustic shrine
Rich odours incense breathe:

So thro' the vale the wanton herds shall bound,
When thy December comes, and on the green
The steer in traces loose
With the free village sport:

No more the lamb shall fly th' insidious wolf,
The woods shall shed their leaves, and the glad hind
The ground, where once he dug,
Shall beat in sprightly dance.
