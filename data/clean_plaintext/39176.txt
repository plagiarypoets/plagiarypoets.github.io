Farewell, my feeble harp! &mdash; now rest awhile&mdash;
Perchance for ever &mdash; ne'er again to ring!&mdash;
Unless (blest thought!) some sweet benignant smile
Of fav'ring Fortune shall "awake thy string,"
And to my pow'rless hand new spirit bring&mdash;
But grant it so &mdash; yet should thy judges frown,
And thy poor lays to dark oblivion fling&mdash;
Then thou, my harp, must lie for ever down,
And moulder on the sward, amid some forest brown.

And to the solemn sentence I shall bow
In silence meek, nor e'er shall I repine&mdash;
Unnumber'd lays must to oblivion go,
Of which the race to come shall hear no line!&mdash;
For not round every brow the lay shall twine;
Its wreath unfading only crowns the few,
Within whose favour'd breasts the fire divine
Burns strong, and glows with warmth for ever new;
And when their bones are dust, Fame does with their shades pursue.&mdash;

Whate'er thy doom &mdash; lov'd harp!  I not regret
The little moments I have struck thy wire&mdash;
For oft to banish woe, with thee I've sat,
And milder thoughts thy tones did aye inspire;&mdash;
Tho' not at all times when I might desire,
Thy sounds, tho' weak at best, would deign to swell&mdash;
And oft I've blam'd thee for a cruel lyre,
That could to woe refuse thy lulling spell.&mdash;
Now let us part as friends &mdash; poor, feeble harp, farewell!&mdash;
