In aunciente days tradition showes
A sorrie wicked elfe arose,
The Witch of Wokey hight;
Oft have I heard the fearfull tale,
From Sue and Roger of the vale,
Told out in winter's night.

Deep in a dreary dismal cell,
Which seem'd, nay was y-cleped hell,
The blue-eyed hag was sty'd;
Nine wicked elves, as legends sayne,
By night she chose her guardian trayne,
All kennell'd close her side.

Here baleful owls oft made their nest,
While wolves its craggy sides possest,
Night howling thro' the rocks;
No wholesome herb cou'd here be found,
She blasted ev'ry plant around,
And blister'd o'er the flocks.

Her haggard face, so foul to see,
Her mouth unmeet a mouth to be,
With eyne of deadly leer,
She nought devis'd, but neighbour's ill,
On all she wreak'd her wayward will,
And marr'd all godlie cheer.

All in her prime have poets sung,
No gaudy youth gallant and young,
E'er blest her longing armes;
Hence rose her fell despight to vex,
And blast the youth of either sex,
By dint of hellish charms.

From Glaston came a learned wight,
Full bent to marr her fell despight,
And well he did, I ween;
Save her's sich mischief ne'er was knowne,
And since his mickle lerninge showne,
Sich mischief ne'er has been.

He chauntede out his godlie book,
He cross'd the water, blest the brook,
Then &mdash; Pater-noster done,
The ghastly hag he sprinkled o'er,
When, lo!  where stood the hag before,
Now stood a ghastly stone.

Full well 'tis known adown the vale,
Tho' strange may seem the fearful tale,
Eke wond'rous may appear;
I'm bold to say, there's never one,
That has not seen the witch of stone,
With all her houshould geer.

But tho' this lernede clerke did well,
With grievede heart, alas!  I tell,
She left this curse behinde:
"My sex shall be forsaken quite,
Tho' sense and beauty both unite,
Nor find a man that's kind."

Now lo!  e'en as this fiend did say,
The sex have found it to this day,
That men are wond'rous scante;
Here's sense and beauty both combin'd,
With all that's good and virtuous joyn'd,
Yet scarce there's one gallante.

Shall such fair nymphs thus daily moane!
They might I trow, as well be stone,
As thus forsaken dwell:
Since Glaston now can boast no clerks,
From Oxenford come down, ye sparks,
And help revoke the spell.

Yet stay &mdash; nor thus despond, ye fair;
Virtue's the god's peculiar care;
Then mark their kindlie voice,
"Your sex shall soon be blest agen,
We only wait to find sich men,
As may be worth sich choice."
