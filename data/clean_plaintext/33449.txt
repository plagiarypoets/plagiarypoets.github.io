How dare I venter to insert a line
Before thy booke, when every word of thine
Doth swell it selfe with a strong winded blast
Of rich embroderd Eloquences, what wa'st
Not fraid of choaking in their bringing out.
Or didst not bord with Lessius about
Some 9 months since conception, and didst there
With in thy throate make a full passage cleere
To give them birth?  what Midwife hadst a hand?
Come not Minerva with Apollo man'd
Merc'ry attending (in his proper place
Most sweetly sings a fift and eight's the base)
Dect with his wings, even hoarse in setting forth
Thy new lict Faetus with its unknowne worth.
Here is a Chimist which from a rude masse
Extracts Elixar that death may well surpasse
Spencers ninth Canto in the fairy Queene,
Or Ben's vulpony, oh had he but seene
Thy pregnant fancy, how could he forebeare
To rend his Cat'line and by Jove to sweare
Thy'ns the better, thou scornst exoticke words
Or Exolericke Phrases which affords
No lustre to thy booke, thy webs not drawne
Or Spun of home-made thred, 'tis pure fitt lawne
For Palace stockings, Th' Acromatick straines
Surely are flowne from out Cylen'ns braines;
Thy words carry charmes, able to lay wist
The direfull magick of an Exorcist,
Come Rhonibus come I prethee pause a while
Thy language is pedanticke, her's a stile
To Court a Lady in, away, away
To Schole young Emperick and make no stay
But come and learne to speake, to Court, to charme
Th' obdurate Mistrisse in thy wanton arme.
Hence all your Momus bratts leave off to fleere
Away you Criticks which are wont to Jeere,
Or else King Arthur with his Knights shall come
And Robin Hood shall strike his paper drum
In his defence, brave Guy shalt bring a long
St. George for England with a warlick throng
Famous Parismus and Primaleon,
Palm'rin D'oliva wito Montelion:
Cease now Antiquity T' hang weeping ore
Brave Sydneys urne invest thy selfe no more
With sable weeds, he lives, for sure there is
Of Souls a sam'an Metempsychosis,
Is this not Sidney; marke his Veine in verse
His stile in prose, I cannot here reherse
His worth in severall arts, here Ptolomy
Or Strabo may learne new Geography,
Here Tycobrah may view the turning sphers
Making still musick in his listning eares,
Out of thy looke Euclid may learne to frame
A sphere, or draw a paralellograme:
But muse 'tis time to stop, dost thou not see
Thou'rt o're guilty with Tautology;
His booke shall praise it selfe, it may, nay can
Suffice to make an English Vatican.
