What time Aurora gilds the Eastern skies,
And wakes to life sweet Nature, now refresh'd
By Night's soft care!  O, may I seek thy smiles,
And hail the Lord of day?

The gaudy scene invites me not alone
To view creation in her wond'rous dress,
Rob'd in luxuriant charms, transcending far
The labour'd schemes of art!

Sweet Music wakes the groves; the stately trees
In rustling adoration bow their heads;
While Arts inhabitants proclaim the dawn,
And joyful homage pay!

Hung with Aurora's pearls, blest source of life!
Parent of great existence!  let me view
Thy orient locks of gold, reflected bright
In each enamour'd stream.

While past'ral melody delights the vales,
And glads the woodlands with enchanting notes,
I woo thy mild embraces, heav'nly Morn!
And meet thy whisp'ring gales.

O, thou!  whose glories charm the wond'ring eye,
And wake sensation thro' the mystic world,
In contemplation lost, I feel thy pow'r,
And draw a veil on DOUBT!

To thee all NATURE adoration pays,
Celestial Morn!  And bend the grateful knee;
Till all thy creatures yield to sober Eve,
And dream in silent praise!
