ROGER.
Well, nibour Branky, are you here your lane
Leanin' your back against a cauldriff stane?
An' whistlin' by December's doilsome day,
While Phoebus an' the spring are far away?

BRANKY.
Forsith am I, Roger, my honest frien';
Whar's this you're gaen'?  an fu's a sin' the streen?
May be ye're thinking me like mony mae
Whase lips are gladsome while their heart are wae;
Na, Roger, man, whan a' thing's right within,
The scowls of fortune are na' worth a grin.
Clad in my plaid, my heart's as fu' o' chear
As laird or lord that silk and sattin wear.
I'm quit contentit, man, wi' this lythe bield,
What greater pleasure cou'd a palace yield?

ROGER.
It's well wi' you; but Branky, had you been
Wi' me last night, you'd sing anither teen.

BRANKY.
The Lord watch oer's!  is a' thing right at hame?
You're either no yoursel, or in a dream.
Has ony harm come o'er the barn or byre?
Has young or auld fo famish'd in a mire?
Upo' your tongue dwells some unchancy tale;
What ails you, Roger, man, to look so pale?
What pickle's this you're in &mdash; Your pobrach pow
Is a' gaen o'er wi' feathers, caff an' tow,
Your onner 'buliments are a' unbound;
You're just like ane new risen frae the ground,
A' shiv'rin wi' the cauld. &mdash; An' syne your looks
Would gluff a minister, wi' a' his books.
The meiths o' sorrow down frae baith your een
In muddy spraings upo' you cheeks are seen.
Speak, man, ye sanna need to ax me twice,
As far as I can do, or yet advise.

ROGER.
We're a' right sober on't, my trusty frien',
A wierd-wife took her lodgin' wi's the streen;
'Mang ither things, daft Robbie bade her spae
Withier it was to us, for well or wae,
That lairds an' lords, an' wights of less renown,
In bourrachs met in ilka burrows-town?
An' whan we might expect this ugly stour
'Tween Britain an' her bairns would anes be o'er?

BRANKY.
Well, Roger, man, what mair?  for never yet
Cou'd I imagine what about they met.
Some say the hills that drink up a' the rain
Are gaen to be made level wi' the plain.
An', wondrous to be tauld!  whan that's a done,
A ladder's to be made to reach the moon.
An' some alledge they're gaen to raise a band
To chace the fairies out of a' the land.
But ithers think (may heaven all ill fore-feind!)
That this sad warld is near hand at an end.
But, man, I lang the wierd-wife's tale to ken;

ROGER.
Lat never mortal hear the like agen!
She says the time, the frightsome time's at hand,
Whan Tammas Rymer's prophecy maun stand;
Than mony a lass her lemman lost shall mourn,
An' blood rin o'er the banks o' mony a burn.

BRANKY.
That's wondrous, Roger!  had she here an end?

ROGER.
Na, man, I fear she's sister to some fiend.
Whan this was o'er she took's a' to the green,
Syne turnin' up her wild unwarldly een,
She gooly'd out, that in the lift she saw
Britannia fightin' wi' America:
Armies  wi' armies match'd in dread array,
Scarin' the wild Atlantic wi' their fray;
Rivers of blood, an' cities a' in flame,
Wi' ither sights that makes me quack to name.
Shapes brynnin' like the light'ning thro' the air,
Wi' bloody 'buliments, an' burnin hair,
She swore she saw, till moon an' starns wi' fright
Or sunk into the sea, or vanish'd out of sight!

BRANKY.
Wonder o' wonders, Roger!  without threep
You mak the flesh on a' my banes to creep.

ROGER.
We a' cam in right eery wi' the fright,
An' Elspy faintet whan she saw the light;
Syne clappin' baith her hands, cry'd what's my boy?
Whar's Robbie now, our uphol an' our joy?
They'll hae him frae's &mdash; rin, Maggie, bar the door,
Look gin ye see them comin', thro' the bore.
I'd rather a' their towns were in a cairn
Than lose my jolly lad, my kindly bairn.
Troth, Branky, man, I hinna faul't my een
Since here I left you havrin' late the steen.
I own the wierd-wife's saws I didna like,
But held my peace, an' sat as dumb's a tyke.

BRANKY.
Well, Roger, you did right.  I hinna skeel
Of fowks that lig o'er muckle wi' the deil.
Trust a' to Heaven; gif Robbie maun gang out,
Bid God be wi' 'm to gi' his faes a clout.
He'll do't, else I'm mista'en as well's anither,
Gang hame your wa's an' tell this to his mither.
I'll pawn, gif she's a woman, she' allow
Young Rob will do the best that he may dow,
To gi' that vile rebellious pack a dird,
An' bring the faes o' Britain to the yird.

ROGER.
But bide ye, Branky, till you hear the rest.
This morn, 'ere light began to spraing the east,
To town gaed wily Daniel to smell out
What main intent their honours met about.

BRANKY.
An' here comes Daniel trodgin' up the hill,
I'll pawn my lugs the lad has got a gill.
Well, honest birky!  are you anes come hame?
We're greenin', man, to hear what sort of game
The knabs hae been about.

DANIEL.
'Twill soon be o'er well kent by auld an' young.

BRANKY.
Speak, Daniel, speak, an' set our hearts at ease;
Whan will this ugly cullishangie cease?
Is GEORGE, God bless him!  ay to wear the crown?
An' Thurso still to be a burrows-town?
That cullion Hancock, is he yet alive?
Ill, ill mat he an' a' his menzie thrive!

ROGER.
Ah Branky, had your tongue, an dinna bann,
We're o'er lang i' this warld &mdash; ay are we man!
'Twere better to be five feet under ground,
Than left to wither out this weary stound.

BRANKY.
Ah!  fy, for shame!  if better canna' be,
We'll fight it for our hills and liberty:
O'er seas an' mountains, man, an' hew them down,
That dare to pluck a pearl frae Georgy's crown.
Lang, lang may he his gransir's bonnet fill,
An' shame confound them a' that wish him ill.

DANIEL.
Well, nibour Branky, that's the very thing
The knabs hae writ a letter to the king,
An' sworn by blood an' 'ounds,' wi' might an' main,
To make Britannia mistress o' her ain.

BRANKY.
Hegh!  Dany, man, an' are we a' gaen' aff
To beat the wild Americans to caff?
But harkee, lad!  gif gun an' sword should fail,
We'll rin against them wi' a muckle flail,
An' thrash them a' to gloy!

ROGER.
Ah!  weary fa
That dorty deltit dame, America!
'Twas anes thought she was comin' o'er the sea
To own her fault, an' clap her deddie's knee.
The muckle wauner to her senseless snout,
Stiff-necked quean!  she well deserves a clout.

BRANKY.
An' that she'll find:  if Britain anes cries Yaul!
She'll at her feet like ony puddock sprawl.
Cry minny lat me be; I'm a' your ain,
I'll never bell the cat wi' you again.
Forboden limmer!  ought she so to pass?
Nurs'd frae a gaitlin' till she grew a lass,
Wha syne turn'd tail, an', without dread or shame,
Had face to say, She'd follow her ain game?
If Britain has twa hands upon her, now
Or never is the time to mak her rue.
But ablins Britain will, like mony mair,
Wink till her bairn is ruin'd, wi' mislear;
Syne she may lownder on, an' spill her blood,
Put out her een, but never mak her good.

ROGER.
The bairn its naturality has tint,
But Britain's heart is not a heart of flint:
Tho' foul the flyte, 'twere better far, I trow,
To kiss the dorts awa', an' mak a vow,
Onward to walk till doomsday arm in arm,
An' live aboon the dread o' warldly harm.

BRANKY.
Now Roger's right again: &mdash; But lads, we'll hame;
I'll sing nae langer wi' a hungry wame.
Roger an' Danny, gin ye'll follow me,
Beneath my roof right welcome shall ye be.
I've cakes an' ale, an' ither things a-sowth,
An' may be something else to quench your drowth:
We'll drink the good o' ev'ry living thing,
Health to the bonny lasses an' the king.
Come shepherds, come, we's hae a heartsome feast,
An' gang to bed as blyth as kings at least.
