JOSIE.
Welcome, kind Jamie, to your beil again,
And friends to me, and a' that plow the plain:
Lang look'd we for your coming down the glen,
To bare our hearts, and tell you a' our mane.

JAMIE.
Thank you, gude Josie, I'm not lang awa',
Ae week, nae mair; yet I have thought it twa:
Ill-meaning dreams sae haunted me in sleep,
That a' the live-lang night frae kindly rest me kept.

JOSIE.
Nae ferley, neighbour, ye had frightfu' dreams,
That brake your rest, and troubled a' your brains.
Sad things hae happen'd syn ye clam the hill,
Whilk grieves us a', and makes our blude stand still.

JAMIE.
O tell them soon, and ease my heart o' pain.
Is Dapple-Gray, or Slae-black Yade that's gane?
Is Brauny Bill, or Hammel-Horn elf-shot?
Or 'mang our ews had come the dolefu' rot?

JOSIE.
That's no the case; alas!  if that were a',
Well might we reckon sicken skaith but sma;
But mair nor that, and mair nor I can tell,
Has you, and me, and a' the holm befel.

JAMIE.
In dreary doubt O me nae langer keep!
O tell the cause that gars you sair to weep!
To greet sae sair, I ween is nae light thing;
And maun frae some sad waefu' dolour spring.

JOSIE.
Waefu' indeed!  to thee, to me, to a';
Our faithfu' shepherd now is ta'en awa'.
Twa days, since he was laid in eard hae gane;
The best o' shepherds!  and the best o' men!

JAMIE.
Heart-riving news!  ah!  wail-a day!  my friend!
An' is it true our herdsman's reacht his end?
Has cruel Death, that ruefu wight!  then sped,
And laid him laigh amang the folk that's dead?

JOSIE.
Rest his blest saul!  ah!  that they were na true,
Thir dolesome tidings that I tell to you;
Again we'd whistle as we plow the plain,
And he fu' cheary when we loos'd at e'en.

JAMIE.
Yes!  well we might; but we will sing nae mair,
Or when we loose at e'en, or yoke at air:
Sin he is gane wha carefu' fed our flocks,
Our days are done, and ilka heart-string breaks.

JOSIE.
Ah!  Jamie, Jamie, soon I'll now inlack;
The morn, may be, I'll that dark journey take:
Since he has gane, nae flocks are now my care,
Nor cow, nor stot, nor a' my naigies mair!

JAMIE.
Nor mine:  and, Josie, oh!  I maun you tell,
I fear'd this stroke that has us a' befel.
For ae mirk night, a wee ere I stept West,
When our red cock wi's hens had gane to rest,
Not far frae ten, as if he kend this ill,
Clapt baith his wings, and craw'd right loud and shrill.

JOSIE.
O'er well I mind!  ah!  that ye tald niest day,
When frae the muir we brought the wander'd quey:
And then, ye ken, as we came thro' the Earn,
The scrieching pyets daubed a' our barn.

JAMIE.
Too true, I wat!  Beside, the following night,
Thro' a' the lift was seen an unco' sight:
Sharp-pointed things ran withershins as fast,
As e'er the gled pursu'd a bird in haste.

JOSIE.
O dool!  these signs were not for naething sent:
Ye see the end has tald us what they meant.
Our ews will wander now, o'erblaw wi snaw,
Or wylie Laurie takes them great and sma'.

JAMIE.
Our wint'rings too, will drown in bogs and glens,
Fa' o'er high crags, and get mischancy ends;
Yea, a' our beasts will melt frae us like snaw;
Sin he that kept them right's sae far awa'.

JOSIE.
Right well I wat!  he kept them night and day,
Nor a' his time did ony e'er misgae:
True is his trust as ony ashen bough
That e'er we took to make ourselves, a plough.

JAMIE.
The wee short loch out owre, when not ay blast
Has on its tap an angry curl cast,
Was ne'er mair smooth, than ay his chearfu' face,
Or on the hill, or in our beiling was.

JOSIE.
The kindlie ew nae mair affection had
For the young lambkin which herself has fed,
Nor an auld carle for his young bonny wife,
Than he for a' that breath'd the breath of life.

JAMIE.
And then, to him that rules owre a' aboon
With single mind he pray'd, baith late and soon;
Pray'd for us a', pray'd for our gear's increase:
And aft he got, and ay he wish'd our peace.

BAITH.
But, now he's gane, life hardlie's worth our care;
Nor cow, nor stot, nor a our nagies mair!
