Just at the Center of this Active All
(Whence Order takes alternate Rise and Fall;
Whence Matter has it's multiplying Force,
And Motion it's diversifying Sourse)
Of ev'ry Thing the secret Embryo lies,
That Action can produce, or Thought devise;
Variety has here eternal Sport,
And here Imagination keeps her Court;
Hither th' Ideas menial Fancy brings
Of uncreated, and created Things;
Which, with a Pow'r as quick, as uncontroul'd,
Are turn'd to all Designs, and cast in ev'ry Mold.
