When Werter fair Charlotte beheld,
As she danc'd with the nymphs on the green,
He thought ev'ry maid she excell'd,
And he prais'd the soft grace of her mien;
But all her accomplishments known,
Gentle Werter began to adore,
He sighs for a heart not her own,
And the joys of poor Werter are o'er.

Tho' vows the fair Charlotte engag'd,
As a friend gentle Werter was dear;
Her smiles oft his sorrows asswag'd,
While pity has dropt a soft tear;
Urg'd by love, he grew bold, and she cry'd,
Werter leave, and see me no more&mdash;
He sigh'd &mdash; he obey'd &mdash; and he dy'd,
Then the sorrows of Werter deplore.

Ye nymphs let not Cupid deceive,
Under pity's soft garb hide his dart,
Werter's sorrows are laid in the grave,
While pity still wrings Charlotte's heart;
And oft o'er his grave has she cry'd,
While with flow'rets she deck't it all o'er&mdash;
He saw me &mdash; he lov'd &mdash; and he dy'd,
Then the sorrows of Werter deplore.
