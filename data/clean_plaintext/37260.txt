Obscure, low in a humble cottage lived
A father, mother, and a gen'rous friend,
Who, all their pious children had survived,
Nor yet had come to life's uncertain end:
Within their cot, kind nature seemed to blend
Fair virtue, innocence, and sweet content,
Nor suffered one vile, base, dissembling fiend,
Disturb that humble unassuming tent;
But wrapt in love divine their souls were heavenward bent.

From worldly care, from sorrow, pain and strife,
Long had they lived in this sequestered scene,
Devoid of all that plagues and poisons life,
'Till age, old age, had crept along serene,
And found them there far happier I ween,
Thus lowly in retirements fond embrace,
Than palaced kings in youthful hours have been,
In open show, with all their pomp and grace,
And every wily art that counterfeits the face.

No art had they, no mild and radiant smile
Played on their cheek, nor dropt the chrystal tear,
Save when their thoughts were bent of God the while,
Save when their hearts o'erflowed with love sincere!
Save when their souls in fond affection dear,
Gazed on the heavens with a wishful eye!
But willing to remain or to appear,
As it should please their gracious God on high,
Who watched around their cot with a paternal eye.

Oh!  gracious heaven!  such as these reward,
And fondly eye them with peculiar care;
O be their friend, their guardian, and guard,
When cruel death shall chance to wonder there!
And oh!  attend to their last fervent pray'r
When they shall leave the scene they long have viewed,
Uphold their age amid death's livid glare,
And when their tongues no more lisp "Great God!"
Their rising souls shall speak in tears of gratitude!
