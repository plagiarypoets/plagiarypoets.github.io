INVECTIVE AGAINST METAPHYSICIANS, AND SELF-CONGRATULATION OF THE POET.
Ye quibbling sages, fam'd in Gothic cells,
From your perplexing tracks and endless maze
The Muse, deliver'd, seeks the flow'ry dells,
And cheerful carols lovely Nature's praise.
Full sweet and pleasant are her summer-lays.
But had she wont with you, still blank and dull,
In worthless labour had she past her days,
With fabling lore to cheat Devotion's gull,
Obscure, nor then as now of blooming honors full,

Then had our skeptics held their cause secure,
And counted wit and truth alike their own:
Nor Hume had shrunk, unable to endure
The smarting lashes on his shoulders thrown.

COLLOQUIAL TRIUMPHS.
I triumph in the ill-dissembled groan,
When Wit perplex'd with puzzled fingers drums;
And hold the victory proclaim'd my own,
When beau confounded ends of op'ras hums,
Or from the straining chest hard-hawk'd up laughter comes.

PANEGYRIC OF DR. J&mdash;N.
But stop, my muse; make ready with thy tears;
For mighty J&mdash;n pour the plaintive song,
Whose fame shall sound while Time preserves his ears.
He charg'd, like me, the Sceptic Powers among!
While all his virtues to my mem'ry throng,
My bitter soul all comfort does refuse!
And now I hear the ev'ning's solemn gong,
Home must I hie to shun the chilling dews;
But as I go I'll mourn &mdash; O weep apace, my Muse!
