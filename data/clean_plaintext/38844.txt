The Vesper bell has toll'd for evening prayer,
As on yon Gothic arch the Moonlight sleeps,
A solemn requiem fills the tranquil air,
While in her cell the Child of Sorrow weeps.

Slow through each gloomy grate and cloister drear,
Wrapt in the veil of  Penitence, I go,
My cheek e'er humid with Contrition's tear,
A tear Reflection e'er will teach to flow.

Low at this sacred shrine I fervent kneel,
There pour the votive prayer and deep-drown'd sigh:
Yet this sad heart no rhapsody can feel,
And Hope ne'er animates my languid eye.

The choral hymn, with soft seraphic strain,
Inspires each heart with energy divine,
As solemn echo through this Gothic fane
Resounds each vesper breath'd at Virtue's shrine.

The lamp of Hope extinguish'd in my breast,
The thorn of keen Remorse too refug'd there,
Lost to the World! &mdash; by Sorrow deep opprest,
Fate points me out the victim of Despair.

Yet, as the lingering sparks of Life decay,
And the last tear of contrite Sorrow flows,
May one faint gleam from Mercy's glowing ray
Gild the sad scenes tht close the sufferer's woes!
