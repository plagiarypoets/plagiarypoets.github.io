Blot not thy beautie (fairest) yet unkinde,
With cruell usage of a yeelding hart,
The stoutest Captaine scornes such bloody minde,
Then mingle mercy where thou causedst smart;
Let him not die in his May-springing dayes,
That living vowes to honour thee for ever,
Shine forth some pitty from thy sun-like rayes,
That hard froz'd hate may so dissolve and sever;
Oh, were thou not much harder then a flint,
Thou had'st ere this been melted into love,
In firmest stone small raine doth make a print,
But seas of teares cannot thy hardnes move.
Then wretched I must die before my time,
Blasted and spoyled in my budding prime.
