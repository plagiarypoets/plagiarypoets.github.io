Like to the forked lightning is my thought,
Scathing each tender thing whereon it lights,
And, like the cloud, it bursts from, I am brought
To live as in the gloomiest of Earth's nights.
My bosom, like the heaving ocean, frights
The head that rests upon it by its throws;
And this it is to dare the poet's flights,
To soar to heaven, yet wail o'er worldly woes.
Oh, he who feels thus hapless, sadly knows
'Tis indescribable.  It is a state
Which speech, if from an angel's tongue it flows,
Can never tell; and mine is such a fate,
I've purified my feelings, 'till I've grown
Too sensitive, and know my heart it is not stone.
