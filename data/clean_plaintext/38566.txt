Here lays his head upon the chair's hard back,
A youth for sleeping to this club well known;
Good nature smil'd at birth of honest Jack,
And Somnus mark'd him for her own.

Good was his heart as e'er warm'd human clod,
Heaven did not fail a recompence to send;
He gave to company ('twas all he had) a nod,
In each acquaintance he held fast a friend.

No father seek his merits to disclose,
Nor draw his frailties, if any, forth to light;
Let him and them in slumbering ease repose,
Lost to the pleasures of a jovial night.
