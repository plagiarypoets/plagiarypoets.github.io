Thy hills, thy pastures Mirfield, and the shade
Of Kirklee's pendant woods, and Calder's stream,
Pride of the sinuous vale!
Shall in remembrance live,

While yet the breeze that fans the whispering grove,
The sun's warm radiance, and the softer gleam
Of the moon's pensive orb
Can soothe the Poet's soul.

Yet not thy hills, thy pastures, and thy groves
Of pendant shade, or Calder's sinuous stream,
With sunny radiance bright,
Or the moon's pensive beam,

Tho' sweet to sense, the genuine rapture wakes.
No &mdash; dearer far, the cordial Muse reveres
The hospitable roof,
And Pilling's social name.
