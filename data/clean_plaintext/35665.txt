November wind had wad the flow'rs away,
An' ca'd the leaves frae ilka bendin' spray:
Pale grew the verdure on the vale below,
When Samuel dander'd out to Queensb'ry cairn,
An' sat him down, a lesson gude to learn:
His flocks were feedin' round, sae fair to see;
Of ilka care his 'onest heart was free.

Of prospects careless he so oft' had seen,
From Arran black, to Cheviot hills sae green;
From Skiddaw, Man, and Erin's fertile shore,
To where the pointed paps of high Ben-More
Erect, amid the Grampian desart, drew
His notice, like a distant vapour blue.

The day was pleasant like a day in May,
An' Jock cam' stridin' up the muir-land way.
Some learned fock will listen wi' delight
To twa young shepherds trackin' on the height.

JOCK.
Hech, Samuel, sure the day we fear'd is come;
A day that will of thousands seal the doom!
I've nearly tint my breath, wi' hastening here,
To see if you could tell me what's asteer,
But it appears owr evident to me
The Cadiz fleets have reach'd the Irish sea;
For hear, on ilka side the Sol'way shore,
Peal after peal, the cannons loudly roar:
There groans I hear through Gall'way hills around,
An' Queensb'ry dinnles wi' the dreadfu' sound.
We manna now the glorious contest shun,
The danger's near, let's get our guns an' run.
They wadna, save an' some prodigious fray,
Sae loose their cannons on the Sabbath day.

SAMUEL.
At leisure, Jock, at leisure; you shall hear
How little you the Cadiz fleets need fear:
Wil'd frae their hole, by Nelson's art profound.
Their pride has got a deep and deadly wound;
That mighty fleet, who thought the seas their ain,
Are a' mishacker'd, tatter'd, taw'd, an' ta'en.
These distant vollies which our echoes raise,
Are sound of triumph for the joyful news.

JOCK.
Blest be the Ruler o' the earth an' sea,
For grantin' us sae great a victory.
But O 'tis worthy our eccentric days,
Wi' guns an' powder to exalt his praise.

SAMUEL.
A roughsome way o' praisin' God indeed;
I think it queer; in that we're baith agreed.

JOCK.
But a' that ever sail'd aneath the skies
By Nelson are outdone in enterprise:
He's sic a terror to our en'mies a'.
'Tis past belief what he has sunk an' ta'en.

SAMUEL.
At leisure, Jock, at leisure; Nelson's gane!

JOCK.
Good God!  is Nelson kill'd?

SAMUEL.
'Tis truely sae.

JOCK.
Then deil tak' them, an' a' the ships they ha'e:
For though enrich'd by a' the fleets in Spain,
Our loss had still been greater than our gain.
Ah, heavy news for Britain and for me!
Yes, Nelson, I maun drap a tear for thee.

SAMUEL.
Yestreen at Slack's, I tauld as I cam' bye,
An straight amazement byth'd in ilka eye;
The smearers glowr'd, an' cry'd, Is Nelson gane?
An' swore their guardian frae their side was ta'en.
The tar they lately up like ribbons drew,
Fell frae their hands an' slaister'd a' the woo'.
If a' the fock wad mourn as sair for me,
I wadna grudge at ony time to die.

JOCK.
When news arriv'd that faes war on the seas,
His very name set a' our hearts at ease:
The very dullest herds amang us a'
Of Nelson's valour never miss'd to blaw:
My uncle strak' John Millar on the face,
For ca'ing him lazy in his Southern chace.

SAMUEL.
But, Jock, I have a project in my head,
Our grief can naething ser' the valiant dead;
Here, on this spot, a mighty cairn we'll rear,
In mem'ry o' the chief we held so dear.
I spoke to Hogg, on every project keen,
An' see the lines he penn'd for it yestreen.

THE INSCRIPTION.
Let all the lads on Nith and Annan learn
The Queensb'ry shepherds rear this rustic cairn
In mem'ry of a great and noble tar,
A gen'rous soul, a thunderbolt in war:
On Britain's foes, who British vengeance hurl'd,
In ev'ry quarter of the wond'ring world:
The muddy Nile his mighty prowess saw;
And Afric's sable sons were kept in awe:
Round It'ly's shores the conquering flag he heav'd;
And Western India his name reliev'd:
It made the shores of France and Holland shake;
The French to tumble, and the Dutch to quake.
He cow'd the haughty pride of silly Spain,
And pour'd destruction on the frighted Dane.
After a life of glorious dangers past,
In Vict'ry's arms, resign'd, he breath'd his last.
But evermore shall shine his honour'd name
With gilded splendour in the rolls of fame:
That name with artless pen we here insert,
'Tis NELSON!  dear to ev'ry British heart.
