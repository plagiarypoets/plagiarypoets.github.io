COLIN.
Wow!  Sandy, is this you &mdash; fat's brought you here?
Upo' my word you've been right soon asteer:
But ha!  your best coat on, an' white cravat,
An' foul stick pride!  a buckish beaver hat;
Fair fa' me!  but you're grown an uppish spark,
I maist mistook you for some En'bro' Clerk!

SANDY.
Wisht, Colin, wisht, it's no a time to taunt,
I'm ga'en, my friend, upo' a mournfu' jaunt;
A gate that I, an' mony mae cou'd spar'd,&mdash;
To see the Ayrshire Poet's banes interr'd!

COLIN.
Och willawins!  hech, that's my dream yestreen,
Scarce had I fa'n asleep ayont my Jean,
Fan in a birken buss methought, I saw
The sweetest Mavis e'er sang here awa;
Its notes were lilted wi' sic pleasin' sound,
That fouk came flockin' frae the fields a' round;
Fan waes my heart! &mdash; its wings begude to shak',
An flaffer sae, my heart was like to brak',
Till o'er it whumbl'd wi' sic dowie cheep,
As gart me jump, an' waken frae my sleep.

SANDY.
Tho' dreams fu' aft frae reckless bosoms spring,
Fan Fancy wallops on her playfu' wing,
Yet sic forebodin' seems na sent in vain,
For Rabbie rang the Mavis o' the plain:
Aft wi' delight I've heard his whistle bla',
Whase echoe banish'd ilka care awa;
Now, grief to say, his sangs in silence drown'd,
The Scotian Muse has got her death-struck wound!

COLIN.
Na, Sandy lad, his sangs in silence sink!
As soon sall Phoebus tak his hindmost wink;
While daisies deck the "bonnie banks o' Ayr;"
While Luggar's vales smile wi' the summer fair;
As lang the lads o' Kyle sall souff his strains,
An' Carrick cummers chant them o'er her plains.

SANDY.
Right, Colin, right, nane dare gainsay your tale,
Yet fair we'll miss his whistle on the dale;
His pipe nae shepherd but himsel cou'd tune,
Now frae us reft his saftest sangs are done;
Yet sure, while Poverty's the peasant's lot,
His Cottar's E'enin' ne'er will be forgot;
The rural picture, by his wondrous art,
Mith envy raise into a monarch's heart.

COLIN.
For fun an' fire, an' laugh-provokin' flights,
Aft has he chear'd our weary winter nights;
Fan gloamin' fell, an' a' our oras done,
Belike the sna brook bokin' frae our shoon;
Fu' snugly set, our dozen'd taes to beek,
Our master leanin' on the haffet cheek,
Frae Rabbie's sangs wad scrifted aff bedeen,
His pair o' Dogs, Horn-buik, or Hallow-e'en;
Till ilka quean sat gaffin' at her wheel,
Forgetfu' that her stent was yet to reel:
But o'er them a' was Tam o' Shanter's mare,
We sometimes leugh, an' sometimes hirch'd wi' fear;
Sae gleg he drew them at their dev'lish dance,
As maistly flang our Marion in a trance;
An' e'en mysel', that night ga'en up the loan,
I swat, an' hearken'd for Auld Hornie's drone!

SANDY.
Weel cou'd he joke, but fan he tun'd his reed
In Sorrow's strain, to sing some dowie leed,
He wad ha'e mov'd the cauldest heart o' stane,
An' gart it dirl, to hear his waefu' mane:
Fan for Glencairn he ga'e his bosom vent,
My tears ha'e join'd him i' the "loud lament."
His Mountain Daisy, type o' Love forlorn,
Rins thro' the saul as sharp as ony thorn.

COLIN.
Ay, Sandy, now that ye're begun wi' Love,
Fa better kent its secret springs to move?
Fan frownin' Fate wi' her unchancy hand
Shor'd fair to force him to a foreign land,
His lines to Lizzie sae o'ercame my heart,
That I exclaim'd, "Lord lat them never part!"

But Sandy, tell me, (for I'll trust your skill,)
Some fouk at Rabbie bare nae gryte gude will;
They said, he o' the Clergy made a mock,
An' held Religion as a laughin' stock;
Now d'ye think that he deserv'd sic blame?
Gin sae be true, it was a burnin' shame!

SANDY.
Sma' skill ha'e I, sic kittle points to clear,
Albeit I've thought he was inclin'd to sneer;
Nor wad his worth seem'd ony less to me,
Tho' he had learnt to lat the "Kirk abee."
Yet after a', the callan had excuse,
For siccan frailties frae a youthfu' muse;
He saw Hypocrisy, wi' haffet sleek,
At heart a Judas &mdash; but like Moses meek;
Whase constant crune was ay frae haly writ,
To mock th' Almighty, an' mankind to cheat:
An' Superstition, wi' her wrinkl'd brow,
Deep sunken een, an' cheeks o' deadly hue;
Whase breath unhalsome, blasts ilk balmy flow'r
That Heav'n bestows to bless life's earthly bower:
Thae cummers aft-times on mankind impose,
Yet can be prov'd Religion's blackest foes;
At them the billie drew sharp Satire's quill,
An' did his best to hound them o'er the hill.
But grantin' Colin, that his Muse did wrang,
To mak' their fau'ts the subject o' her sang,
Gryte wits ha'e failin's, an' they're easy seen,
Sma spots seem muckle i' the diamond's sheen;
Wha frae his neebour claims a perfect part,
Is but a green-horn &mdash; stranger to his heart.
Deep i' the dust be a' his frailties laid,
An' rest in peace, thou dear departed shade!
Aboon thy bosom fall the lavrock greet,
An' briss the daisy wi' her dewy feet:
Fan westlin' winds fetch in the gladsome spring,
The mournfu' swains sall a' their off'rin's bring,
The first fair blossoms o' the op'nin' year,
Sall strew thy grave, bedew'd wi' mony a tear.
The Scotian Muse, now childless an' forlorn,
May hang her harp upo' some lonely thorn,
Syne wi' the widow'd gowdspink greet her sill,
Till her wild wailin's echoe o'er the hill;
Her ae best bairn, alas!  lies sound asleep;
For him what minstrel wad refuse to weep?
Arise anes mair, dear Caledonian Muse!
An' ae bright spark o' Rabbie's fire infuse,
In some saft breat inspire a plaintive sang,
An' waft his praises wi' the winds alang;
Till ilka swain on Scotia's farthest shore,
Wi' sobbin' breast sall Rabbie's death deplore:
Tell them wha mourn for sic a dawtie gane,
There's ane ahint has gryter cause for mane;
The kind companion o' his youthfu' breast,
A widow now wi' Poverty opprest:
Around her knees five smilin' bairnies thrang,
An' sure her heart maun suffer mony a pang,
To see pale Hunger clead their face with care,
An' cauld winds whistlin' i' their oxters bare;
Sweet little lispers!  maun ye now be left
Defenceless orphans, o' relief bereft?

COLIN.
Forbid it Heav'n!  Sall British kindness cease,
That dights the tear frae Mis'ry's bluther'd face?
Na!  we're a nation kent for kinder acts,
An' lift the lade frae mony weary backs:
Were it but kent what Rabbie's left ahint,
(An' soon we'll see't in ilka public print,)
Ise wad my lug, they'll find some canny scheme,
To beet their wants, an' eke the nation's fame.
An' for mysell, while I've a pair of ewe's,
As now a score gang bleatin' o'er the knows,
The fattest gimmer frankly I'll send aff,
To gi'e the totums their new-year's-day's scaff!

SANDY.
Fair fa' you, Colin, for your gen'rous heart!
Blest is the man wha taks the widow's part.
The orphan's blessin' reeks aboon the lift,
To Him wha has a' comforts in his gift.

But I'm forgettin', sax lang mile o' gate
I've yet to gang, I fear I'll now be late;
For see, the plowmen wi' their yokin' till'd,
Come whistlin' hameward o'er the gow'ny field;
The cattle spangin' to the cauldrife pool,
Now leave the bait their slaffin' sides to cool,
Frae them I learn my pace maun be but slack:
But we sall ha'e a pint fan I come come back.

COLIN.
Now, hear you me, we'll just go yont the how,
An' see fat chear my Jeanie can bestow;
An' tho' I say't, she can sic fare afford
As mith be seen on ony lordlin's board;
Weel toasted cakes, wi' butter, cream, or cheese,
An smilin' welcome ilka guest to please:
O' sic this mornin' you, my friend, maun taste,
We'll no put aff o'er half an hour at maist;
I'll just fling on my Sunday's coat an' sark,
An' change thir bauchles right fair gane wi' wark;
Syne wander wi' you to the dowie scene,
Aboon his hallow'd dust to pour my mane;
Tho' ablins, some may mak' a gryter fraise,
In kittle words to speak his weel-won praise,
Nane o' them a', I dare be bauld to swear,
Sall sigh mair sad, or drap a tend'rer tear!
