When Corydon left the sweet vale,
Where first he beheld the fair light,
Soft sorrows were heard in the gale,
And sighs broke the silence of night.

It was not the grace of his form,
Nor his skill when he pip'd on his reed,
Which thus could the villagers charm,
Which won their hearts for his meed:

'Twas that Wit, which, so sportive and gay,
By Good-nature was ever restrain'd;
'Twas that mind, which in youth's slipp'ry way
By Honour and Truth was sustain'd.

Now the ocean our Corydon ploughs;
Now a city receives the lov'd youth:
But faithful for aye be his vows
To Good-nature and Honour and Truth.
