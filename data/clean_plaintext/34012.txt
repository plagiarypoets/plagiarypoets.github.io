The snow has left the fells and fled
Their tops i' green the trees hev' cled,
The grund wi' sindry flowers is sown;
And to their stint the becks are fawn:
Nor fear the Nymphs and Graces mair
To dance it in the meadows, bare.
The year, 'at slips sae fast away,
Whispers we mun not think to stay:
The spring suin thows the winter frost,
To meet the spring does simmer post
Frae simmer autumn cleeks the hauld,
And back at yence is winter cauld.
Yit muins off-hand meake up their loss:
But suin as we the watter cross,
To Tullus great, Aeneas guid,
We're dust and shadows wuthout bluid.
And whae, Torquatus, can be sworn
'At thame abuin 'ill grant To-mworn?
Leeve than; wha't's war't i' murry chear
Frae thankless heirs is gitten clear.
When Death, my freind, yence ligs you fast,
And Minus just your duim has past,
Your reace, and wit and worth 'ill mak
But a peer shift to bring you back.
Diana (she's a Goddess tee)
Gets not Hippolytus set free;
And, Theseus aw' that strength o'thine
Can never brek Pirithous' chyne.
