All sights are fair to the recover'd blind,
All sounds are music to the deaf restor'd,
The lame, made whole, leaps like the sporting hind,
And the sad bow'd-down sinner, with his hoard
Of shame and sorrow &mdash; when he cuts the cord,
And drops the pack it bound &mdash; is free again
In the light yoke and burden of his Lord:
Thus, with the birth-right of his fellow men,
Sees, hears, and feels, at once, the righted African.

'Tis somewhat like the burst from death to life&mdash;
From the grave's cearments to the robes of heaven,
From sin's dominion, and from passion's strife,
To the pure freedom of a soul forgiven,
When all the bonds of death and hell are riven,
And mortals put on immortality;
When fear, and care, and grief away are driven,
And Mercy's hand has turn'd the golden Key,
And Mercy's voice has said, "Rejoice, thy soul is free!"
