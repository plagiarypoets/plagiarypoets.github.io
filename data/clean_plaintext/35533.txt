There shines at eve beneath Heav'n's hallowness
A gentle star ycleped Chastitee,
Whose maiden lighte shewes forth suche comliness
As doth outvie all other gemms we see,
From Este, where gold-ey'd PHEBUS doth arise,
And eke from West, where sinkes the car of lighte!
This lovely gem doth greete menn's wond'ring eyes,
No distaunce can controul its lustre brighte,
All nations are astonish'd with the dazzling sighte!

But chefely on oure coaste it dothe appeare,
We most doe feele its kindlye influence;
Above all landes it doth our Island reare,
Giving our Rulers wisdom and prudence.
By this it is we peace and wealth enjoye,
By this in wars we gain the victory;
By this from traitors we drede no annoy;
By this protected is our liberty;
By this is crush'd the threat'ning viper Perfidy!

Though heav'nly, yet this gem I will compare
Unto a lovely maiden of this erthe;
What bootes it that I praise Heav'n's star so faire?
I can butt painte the thinges of mortal birthe:
Then Readerr doe nott checke your courser's fire,
But let your winged fancy take its flighte,
For me I know the maid that doth inspire
Mine heart with gladness and with true delight,
On earthe she hath no peere to charme a mortall's sight.

Her hair I liken to morn's saffron flush;
Her skin is iv'ry, or the marble sleake;
Blue is her eyne as Heav'n; the roses blush
Doth sweetlie wanton on her glossy cheeke!
Her form is like the willowes wavinge spraye,
And withe a VENUS grace she moves alonge!
Nere wanton is she, yet for ever gay;
Lo such my maiden is &mdash; And such her songe,
'Twould, like a second ORPHEUS, lure the savage thronge.

Such is the Ladie &mdash; such the Fairie Queene,
Whose lustre like this eveninge star dothe sheene.
