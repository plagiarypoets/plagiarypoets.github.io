Thou art a radiant giant, mighty Sun!
To whom the universe for life and light
Must trust for ever, as it, aye, hath done&mdash;
Unto the hour in which I proudly write
Of thy divinity and splendours bright,
That make the skies transparent, and the earth
And eloquent ocean, in its billowy height,
Things of surpassing beauteousness, and mirth,
And all stability from thee hath glorious birth!

Thou hast no home, thou universal king!
Thy wand'rings last for ever, and no rest
Shall ere be thine allotment:  wild birds sing
In air awhile, then seek their quiet nest,
Within whose down they slumber and are blest;
Ships, which the lordly billows long have hurl'd
Across the many-colour'd ocean's breast,
At length repose, with every proud sail furl'd;
But thou dost ever roll, untir'd, from world to world.

As little as the eagle heeds the chirp
Of sparrows, the base clouds dost thou regard
Which linger round thee, and thy throne usurp:
For a brief moment is thy face debarr'd,
From gazing upon earth, and they retard
A while the brightness of thy seven-fold beam;
But scarce an instant is its grandeur marr'd&mdash;
The clouds dissolve before thy wrathful gleam,
Again the mountains glow, and sparkles every stream.

Thou art the source of each diviner thought,
That wakes the soul to passion; every ray
Of thine with inspiration's self is fraught,
And where thy fires, in their resistless play,
Pour on the dry earth a terrific day,
Here beat the bosoms unto which belong
The wildest feelings that the spirit sway,
And prompt to actions, great in right, or wrong,
Which form th' immortal themes of never-dying song.

Thou priest over all lands, majestic globe!
Giving new seasons unto every clime;&mdash;
The torrid earth by scorching fires enrobe;
Thou bring'st to northern realms their summer time,
Making the frozen ground burst forth sublime
With kindling verdure, and the icy Pole
Of the same beams that turn the gentle rime,
To healthful moisture, feels the stern control&mdash;
Its fetters slowly break &mdash; and forth the free waves roll!
