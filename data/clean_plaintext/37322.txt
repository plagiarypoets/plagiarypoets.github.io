Far in a vale, where FORTH meand'ring glides,
Where dearest Friendship undisturb'd resides,
There liv'd a simple youth, unknown to fame;
The voice of praise ne'er told his humble name:
Ne'er did the classic page to him display
Its heav'nly light, to guide his doubtful way:
Parnassus' sacred cliffs ne'er met his view,
He never climb'd its consecrated brow;
Nor heard Apollo's lyre, nor Orpheus sing,
Nor ever drank of the Castalian spring.

By Nature taught, she on his soul impress'd
Her sacred laws &mdash; her steps he ever trac'd,
Through the green field, or mead, or sunny hill,
The bubbling fountain, or the crystal rill,
Where Naiads play, or dance the shepherd train,
Where social friendship glads the jocund scene.
Beneath th' embowering shade he often stray'd,
While Nature round him all her charms display'd;
Or at the fall of eve, or early morn,
When pearly dew-drops deck the fragrant thorn,
Set on some lofty mountain's verdant brow,
He'd Nature's vast and varied beauties view;
Of her he spoke, of her in raptures sung;
It flow'd spontaneous from his artless tongue.
Not disappointed hopes &mdash; not keen distress,
Which mark'd his humble lot, could e'er depress
That heav'nly pow'r which still his bosom fir'd;
For still it rose, and still his song inspir'd.
