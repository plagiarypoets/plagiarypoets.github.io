Antiquity unfolds her sacred page;
The heavy mass in ductile fusion runs:
Yours is the science of each vary'd age,
Primordial learning of the classic sons.
Each son of science, and of art, must own
You fill and dignify the classic throne.

Whate'er we seen in wide Creation's plan;
Each gradual system that mankind improv'd;
Those arts, which, civiliz'd from man to man,
Made each respected, honor'd, and belov'd,
In your great work accomplish'd well, we view:
Antiquity is moderniz'd in you.

Hard is the task, and glorious the design,
To open the expanding mind of youth:
To shew unerring Reason how to twine
Her wreaths immortal on the brow of Truth:
Shew Virtue in each diff'rent age renown'd;
Strip  Vice, tho' laurell'd, deify'd, or crown'd.

Yet more:  in your extended plan we trace
Whate'er combin'd the noble, just, and free;
Each living feature of the human race;
A work that is mankind's epitome.
Kings, Sages, Poets, and Historians, here,
Shall mark the aera of each rising year.

Such are they taught by your emending page,
Where shines the quintessence of ev'ry tome;
Rich and ennobled in each splendid age,
From Egypt's monarchy to that of Rome.
From Egypt, Greece, and Rome, extract each flow'r,
To grace BRITANNIA'S isle, and dignify its pow'r.
