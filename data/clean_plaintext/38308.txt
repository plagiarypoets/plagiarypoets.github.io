Death, thus exulting, cast his eyes around,
And spy'd a wight, smart, debonnaire, and gay;
(Ah!  when again shall such a wight be found?)
Nature had form'd him of her richest clay:
(Alack! &mdash; now mark'd to be his destin'd prey.)
His look expressive, piercing were his eyne,
His voice as sweet as Philomela's lay:
Athens or Rome could never boast, I ween,
One, who the buskin wore, or sock, with fame so sheen.

This more than Roscius of the present age,
Nature his Guide, great Shakespear his delight,
Struck out new Beauties, rais'd the drooping Stage,
His every attitude surpriz'd the sight;
Nay, e'en the eyes could speak of this same wight:
In Richard's varied scenes he all out-vied;
Hamlet he felt, reach'd Lear's frantic height;
In Bayes and Archer was the comic Pride,
And, with a Romeo's woe, alternate liv'd and dy'd.

Death long had bore this wight a grudge:&mdash;
In mimic dying he in dudgeon took;
"Quo' he, this Proteus counterfeits so well,
That men will scoff at me." &mdash; He glanc'd a look,
Which ev'ry vital of our Hero shook:
Him he superior own'd, alleg'd his age;
But Death, relentless, would no Parley brook;
"Dar'st ape me, varlet!" &mdash; he reply'd in rage,
"I'll realize thy mocks;" &mdash; So swept him off the Stage.
