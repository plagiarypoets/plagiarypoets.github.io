Collin, my deere and most entire beloved,
My muse audatious stoupes hir pitch to thee,
Desiring that thy patience be not moved
By these rude lines, written heere you see,
Faine would my muse whom cruell love hath wronged,
Shroud hir love labors under thy protection,
And I myselfe, with ardent zeale have longed,
That thou mightst knowe to thee my true affection.
Therefore, good Collin, graciously accept
A few sad sonnets, which my muse hath framed,
Though they but newly from the shell are crept,
Suffer them not by envie to be blamed.
But underneath the shadow of thy wings,
Give warmth to these yong-hatched orphan things.

Give warmth to these yoong-hatched orphan things,
Which, chill with cold, to thee for succour creep,
They of my studie are the budding springs,
Longer I cannot them in silence keepe.
They will be gadding sore against my minde.
But, courteous shepheard, if they run astray
Conduct them, that they may the pathway finde,
And teach them how, the meane observe they may.
Thou shalt them ken by their discording notes,
Their weedes are plaine, such as poore shepheards weare.
Unshapen, torne, and ragged are their cotes,
Yet forth they wandring are, devoid of feare.
They which have tasted of the muses spring,
I hope will smile upon the tunes they sing.
