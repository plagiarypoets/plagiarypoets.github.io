Whilst crowding Nations willing Homage pay,
And at your Feet their grateful Off'rings lay:
Whilst o're the spacious Land, Great Queen, you show'r
The gentle Influence of your softer Pow'r,
Be none orelookt within this happy Isle,
Smile too on those on whom the Muses smile;
Sons of this Royal School:  who boast to trace
From fam'd Elisa their immortal Race:
In early Youth for ever train'd to raise
The pious Column to their Monarch's Praise.

Gladly we saw the Sov'reign passing by,
And read the Joy that danc'd in ev'ry Eye,
When first the Globe was plac'd in GEORGE's hand
And Edward's Crown confirmed his just command.
'Twas then the Queen in all her Lustre shone,
First in his Heart, and Partner of his Throne.
Stately she mov'd along the sacred Way,
Grac'd with the Ensigns of Imperial Sway:
The Golden Tissue veil'd the dazling Air
Of Light, too strong for vulgar eyes to bear.
With equal steps attendant on the Queen
Three Royal Virgins in the Trains were seen:
Her Likeness in the lovely Race we find,
And image absent Fredric in our Mind.
Not the rich Canopy which Atlas bears
O're the wide World, adorn'd with all the Stars,
Beneath its ample Orb contains a Sight
More great and good, more beautiful and bright.
Whilst they proceed each Briton bears a Part,
And shows the Transport of his loyal heart:
Sires tell their Sons, secure of future Bliss,
That the next Age will be as blest, as this.
The Son the Prophecy with Rapture hears,
And feels the Blessings of succeeding Years.

Like Eaglets to the Sun, We try to rise
Warm'd by the Rays of your indulgent Eyes.
Your honour'd Name shall, each revolving year,
The Muses Tribute with Elisa share.
For Gloriana does again appear
To raise a Spencer and a Sidney here.

Your Majesty's
most dutiful and
Loyal Subject and Servant
MIDDLESEX
