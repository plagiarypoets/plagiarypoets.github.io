Fox to whose lot hath fall'n a favorite name&mdash;
A Name to social worth and freedom dear,
Shall not this day's return some mem'ry claim
Which thee, with all thy woes and cares, left here?
Much hadst thou suffer'd in thy youthful prime
And man had been thy foe, worse than to others, time.

Thy cares, thy fears, are gone: &mdash; and never more
May they return upon thy gentle head!
Nor food and shelter thy faint eye implore
Doubtful, nor chill thy trembling limbs bespread
In agony and dread, from hopeless flight,
As when thy quivering life here caught the pitying sight

Of her who still protects thee! &mdash; Taxes come!
Unkind to thee, and thy deserving race,
Of dogs and men PITT little heeds the doom.
But thee, nor tax, nor aught more dire displace.
E'en should invasion come, safe be thou still!
And none do ill to thee, who dost to nothing ill!
