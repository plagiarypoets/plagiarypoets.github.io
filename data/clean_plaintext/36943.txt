Within a spacious chamber, fair and high,
Prone on a couch, all rich and gorgeous wrought,
A Knight was laid, as there at length to die,
For his pale face had death's expression caught,
And with remorse did seem his features fraught;
While by his side, in holy vestures clad,
An aged father him with zeal besought
Sincere, to tell each crime and error sad,
That with polluting blot had stained his life-time bad.

He dared not kiss the blessed crucifix,
Which heavenly mercy proffer'd him withal;
But on the monk a ghastly stare did fix,
Nor seem'd to hear or heed his pious call;
Feebly at length he motion'd from the hall
His trembling menials, and the Sire alone
Remain'd to hear a dread confession fall
From his white lips surcharg'd with many a groan,
For many a fearful deed thro' life's long lapse unknown.

"O holy father," &mdash; thus the dying man,
As ebb'd his parting spirit slow away,
In accents weak and faultering, began:
"Talk not to me of hope or mercy!  nay&mdash;
I have not learnt &mdash; or hoped &mdash; or dared to pray;
For mine are crimes beyond forgiveness' reach,
For which no pray'rs or penitence may pay&mdash;
I tell thee, Friar, thou dost vainly preach&mdash;
To me an angel's voice no hope of bliss could teach:

"Yet could thy dread persuasion aught avail,
To bid me yield confession of the past,
There is a guilty, long-unutter'd tale
Would paint thy pallid features more aghast&mdash;
And oh!  if life's dim taper yet would last,
And thou could'st bear to hear what I could tell&mdash;
&mdash;No matter &mdash; list &mdash; if pity yet thou hast
For one whose heart hath found in life its hell,
List to a tale of blood &mdash; and sound a murderer's knell!

"Start not!  In this but half my guilt is shewn&mdash;
In other years the halls of lone St. Clair
Were grac'd by one whose charms had soften'd stone
Or sooth'd the hungry tiger in his lair&mdash;
Oh holy father!  she was wondrous fair;
And I was then in youth's impatient prime&mdash;
Full well my lips the sequel dark may spare,
I lov'd &mdash; that love hath prov'd the parent crime
Of many a fouler one, from guilty time to time.

"She was another's own betroth'd! &mdash; I see
Thine eye looks horror!  yet awhile forbear&mdash;
Thou canst not guess how vile I learnt to be,
Nor half the errors I must now declare&mdash;
Still had they been a blest and noble pair,
But he departed for a distant field,
And left a treacherous protector there,
The wife he lov'd from injury to shield,
I was his bosom-friend! . . . . Is now my heart reveal'd?

"One night &mdash; Oh father!  be my feelings now
Whate'er thy may &mdash; deep penitence or dread&mdash;
I cannot that dark crime in words avow&mdash;
Suffice to say &mdash; a deed of horror sped&mdash;
Shrieks echoed from a violated bed
Wildly and vain! &mdash; unheard and unredress'd
My victim fell &mdash; but soon the spirit fled."
Then spoke the monk:  "How pass'd she to the blest?"
"Friar!"  he madly cried &mdash; "This poignard found her breast!"

Then came the death-pang o'er him &mdash; on the monk
His eye glar'd dimly horrible &mdash; as slow
And faint within his trembling arms he sunk;
But ere they yielded to the final throe,
Awhile life's embers seem'd again to glow,
And from his lips these last dread accents fell&mdash;
"'Twas injur'd Hubert's bride that perish'd so&mdash;
Her bleeding frame, without a mass or knell,
Beneath St. Clair's we laid &mdash; deep in a charnel cell."

With that, a mist slow gather'd o'er the bed,
Such as at morn o'erhangs the summer lake;
And ere the parting sinner's spirit fled,
It seem'd a dim and dubious form to take,
But ah!  what dread the dreamer's heart did shake!
And what strange pangs oppress'd!  when as it grew
More palpably distinct in look and make,
(Tho' still of faint and spiritual hue)
In that unearthly form, his long lost bride he knew.

There needed not this last appalling sight,
To flash conviction on his burning brain;
Too well remember'd then that guilty Knight,
And she whom he had mourn'd so long in vain.
To yield the dying murderer keener pain
"Monster!"  he shriek'd aloud &mdash; but as he spoke
The visionary beings seem'd to wane,
A thunder peal the strange illusion broke,
And from his dream of dread the hapless chief awoke.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Yet fair and high the sculptur'd tomb he gave
The sad remains of her he held so dear;
And never yet o'er beauty's timeless grave
Might conscious grief more fitly pour the tear,
She left no lovelier and no gentler here:
And many a mass and midnight requiem rose
To soothe her blessed spirit in its sphere,
'Till ceas'd at once her mourner's life and woes,
And in one mutual tomb their ashes found repose.
