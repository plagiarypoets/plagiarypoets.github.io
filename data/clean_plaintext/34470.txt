Behold with ardent Love, and pious care,
The tender mother cast her eyes around;
Delighted with her prattling offspring fair,
Where Field for sage instruction does abound
And much, I ween, she thinks of planting there,
Chaste virtue's favorite field &mdash; meet for such fruitage rare.

Kisses to One she gives with melting glee
While to her throbbing heart another's prest
One little impe she places on her knee
Upon her foot another takes his rest
Eftsoons her eyn the circling train survey,
To mark how Love and truth, in sweet assemblage play.

The lisping word, the supplicating eye,
Full plain their various needment do declare
She kens their actions with a conscious joy
And when she strives with kind maternal Care
With smiles to cherish, or with frowns reprove
Tis aye with good Intent, tis aye with tenderest Love.

So views our heav'nly parent on high
His frail creation with indulgent care
So does his hand each real want supply
Whether he grant, or he reject our pray'r
And, since each action well he can areed,
Certes, he once will grant to every Wight his need.
