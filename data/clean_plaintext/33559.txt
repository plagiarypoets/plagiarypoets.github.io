AMARILLIS, CLAIUS.

THE ARGUMENT.
Amaryillis doth discover
Her desires unto her Lover,
Shewing how her nature scornes
Those whom Vertue not adornes,
After which the swaine and she
Intend by Hymen linkt to be.

In the merry moneth of May,
When the Birds on every Spray
Sat chirping Amarillis faire,
Softer then down, sweter then ayre,
Drove her floks from forth their fold
Which when Claius did behold,
He said, lov'd Nymph, be pleasd that I
May you this day accompany,
Our flocks together feeding, wee
Beneath some broad-branch'd Myrtle Tree
Will sit, where with my pipe will I
Make you pleasant mellodie,
And when Sol our shades shall lengthen,
We with Cates our selves will strengthen.
Within my bag (by me is put)
As good sowse as ere was cut,
With Butter made of purest milk,
And of Curds as soft as silke,
And in my bottle nappie Ale
Made of sweet Mault, and two moneths stale.
And though my buskins are not painted,
Nor I with Courts and Kings acquainted,
Yet, gentle Nymph, take note that I
Am not born ignoblly:
I have seen the Graces three,
When my pipe made mellodie
To daunce about me, and the Faeries
(Who so often nym our Daries)
In a Ring to compasse round,
Obera, tripping on the ground,
Leave behind them to be seen
A perfect Ovall on the green,
The Satyrs rude and full of yre
Have sat and listned to my Lyre,
And when my pipe hath ceas'd to play
Have discontented gone away.
Then, sweet Nymph, be pleas'd that I
May you this day accompanie.

Quoth Amarillis, So may PAN
Preserve my flocks from harme and wan,
So may the Woulfe keep from my Fold,
As I thee (Shepheard) dear do hold.
Although Myrtillus seek my love,
And Palemon, the same do prove,
Although Thomalin much me gives,
And by his wealth to win me strives,
Yet I Myrtillus hate, for he
Comming the other day to me,
As I sate beneath the shade,
Which a broad spreading Beech-tree made,
Had words, and gestures so uncivill,
I see his tongue and heart are evill.
Palemon too, although his flock
Be great, and greater far his stock,
Yet I affect him not, for though,
He hath the art to shrowd it so,
I am acquainted with his mind,
And that he is to ills inclind:
For th' other day within the wood
My flocks by chance having stray'd for food,
As I to gather them was going,
Under a tree I found him wooing
A Shepherdesse unto his Lust,
But seeing me, himself he thrust
Amid the thick and shadie boughes:
And though Thomalin much allowes
In gifts to win me, so to more
Besides my self he giveth store.
Thus (gentle Shepheard) none of these
So well as thee my fancy please,
If thou art mine, as I am thine,
In Hymens joyes we will combine.

Quoth Claius, Shepardess I ween
The god of love my Friend hath been,
That thou dost motion my desires,
And that so mutuall are our fires:
May Woulves burst in unto my fold,
And kill those Ewes I dearest hold,
And may my wreath-hornd Rams decrease,
Nor yeeld to me their wonted fleece,
As will love thee till I die,
But see Titan apace doth hie,
Driving his fiery Carre amaine
The brinie Ocean to attaine:
Now lets depart, to morrow we
Will sing to Hymen merrilie.
