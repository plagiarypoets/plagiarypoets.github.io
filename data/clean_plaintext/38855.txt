DAMON.
Come, Chloe, to my Arms,
At last to Love be won,
Now yield to his Alarms,
Nor longer Pleasure shun;
Now all your Fears give over,
Which once your Heart possess'd;
Now kindly view your Lover,
And make him truly bless'd.

CHLOE.
With what enraptur'd Joy
You Men at first assail;
But soon your Pleasures cloy,
Too soon your Love will fail.
When once your Hopes are over,
When once your Pain's redress'd,
You quite forget the Lover,
Nor ask to make you bless'd.

DAMON.
My Fair, from Pause of Joy,
More heighten'd Bliss we reap,
Nor will the frolick Boy
Eternal Revels keep.
But this I vow sincerely,
All to be vow'd by Man;
Chloe, I'll love you dearly,
As long &mdash; as love I can.

CHLOE.
You Men, when most you're kind,
Still for a Change will plead;
And to Love's Feast we find
A tedious Fast succeed.
But this I vow sincerely,
What shou'd to Man befall,
When you won't love me dearly&mdash;
Why then&mdash;
Why then &mdash; another shall.
