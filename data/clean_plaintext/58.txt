The Praise of meaner Wits this Work like Profit brings,
As doth the Cuckoo's Song delight, when Philomela sings.
If thou hast formed right true Vertue's Face herein;
Vertue her self can best discern, to whom they written bin.
If thou hast Beauty prais'd, let her sole Looks Divine
Judge if ought therein be amiss, and mend it by her eyne.
If Chastity want ought, or Temperance her due,
Behold her Princely Mind aright, and write thy Queen anew.
Mean-while she shall perceive, how far her Vertues sore
Above the reach of all that live, or such as wrote of yore;
And thereby will excuse and favour thy Good-will,
Whose Vertue cannot be exprest, but by an Angel's Quill.
Of me no Lines are lov'd, nor Letters are of Price,
Of all which speak our English Tongue, but those of thy Device.
