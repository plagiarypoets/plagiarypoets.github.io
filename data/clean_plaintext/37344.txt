GIBBIE AND WATTIE.  TWA SHEPHERDS.

GIBBIE.
Come, Wattie, while our Hirsels feed thegither,
Here lean ye down, let's knooff a While to ither,
And beik oursels upon this sunny Brae,
Whar pleasant Lambies round us sweetly play;
Tent how they wag their Tails, and keb the Ews,
How wantonly they skip athoart the Knows.
Youth's a diverting Time for ilka Creature
After its Kind, according to its Nature.
The Cattle leaps for Joy, Burds sweetly sing,
Wi' cheerfou Notes proclaim the pleasant Spring.
The Gowk, the dullest Singer of them a',
Without a Rhyme but ane, or Note but twa;
Yet he attends his Season for to sing,
In Woods and Groves, he makes their Ecchoes ring,
Ropetes his Sang some hundred Times a Day,
Heartsom to hear, in glorious Month of May.
Come let us then with highest Notes express,
And sing Damo Nature, in her youthfou Dress.

WATTIE.
Alas, I'm no in Tune, Gib, let me be,
This forty Days a' may sing dumb for me.

GIBBIE.
Strange, Wattie, what can ail ye?  Hear ye, Lad,
'Tis no your Use and Wont to sae sad.

WATTIE.
Ah!  Gib, gin ye but ken'd my Reason why,
Ye'd turn your Tune, and be as wae as I.

GIBBIE.
Losh, Man!  has ony frightsom Thing come o'er ye,
Last Night ye wak't the Fauld to flie Tod Laurie;
Or, has some feckless Beast lair'd in the Bog,
Danner'd awa, or bit by some wood Dog,
Or by some ither ill Mischance been wrang'd,
Blasted by some ill Eye, or Adder-stang'd?
Or has the Swine gane through the Thing that's been
Sae lang o' making up wi' you and Jean?

WATTIE.
Tho a' these Ills had happen'd on ae Day,
As Good forbid that e'er it should be sae!
The Loss we thole is ten Times greater Skaith.
Can greater be to us than Sanny's Death!

GIBBIE.
Sany, ye say, what Sany do ye mean?

WATTIE.
The blythest Lad that e'er did tread the Green.
Sany, our dearest Friend, and worthiest,
Has ta'en his last Farewel; now he's at Rest.

GIBBIE.
Is Sany dead?  Fit and prepare us a'!
Ane in his Prime sae hasty pow'd awa'!
Thou cruel Death ne'er lets the Grave be toom,
But plucks the fairest Flowers in their Bloom,
And smites, at ony Age, wi' sicken Greed,
Spares neither sakeless Wean, nor lyar'd Head.

WATTIE.
We'd Need a' to be busy in our Day,
Death is the Debt that we hae a' to pay.
Our Time's uncertain, short, and fou o' Sorrow,
Sent here the Day, and ta'en awa' the Morrow.

GIBBIE.
There's my Dream read, that fash'd me Yesternight,
Whan Batie's Youling pat me in sic Fright;
I never was in a' my Days sae fear't.

WATTIE.
What was thy Dream then, Gibbie, let me hear't.

GIBBIE.
I dream'd my Uncle's house was a' on Fire,
Frighted the Ky, and gar'd them break the Byre,
For haste to win awa drew down their Flaiks,
And bure awa their Shakels and their Stakes.
I thought a' bleez'd up like a Tap o' Tow,
For haste, I thought, I ran to quench the Low;
And as I tramped through the Moss-land heather,
That my Shoe-Soles rave frae their Over-leather.
How frightsome-like sic Things to me did seem,
Till I awak'd and fand it was a Dream.

WATTIE.
Watch o'er us Man, but that was fliesome-like.

GIBBIE.
But hear me out the Story o' the Tyke.

WATTIE.
Well, say awa then, Gib, and I sall tent,
And hear ye tell the Way o' his Lament.

GIBBIE.
Then hear me to Amen, and I sall tell,
Wow Man, gin ye had been but there yoursell;
You'd ferly'd to have heard the Beast complain,
Whan I gae'd out to see what he cou'd mean.
Whar was he sittand, think ye, &mdash; but upon
Our Knocking-Stane that lay upo' the Lone;
Held up his Snout forgainst the Peat-Stack-Know,
Wi mony a langsom elreich, Wough, wough, wow;
Swith, Cur, I cry'd, and yet he wad na cease:
I cry'd, Isk, Isk, poor Batie, hae a Piece;
And bad his Closs; but still the grumbling Tyke,
Ran farder aff, and youl'd at the Fauld-Dyke;
I ran to chase him, but a' was in vain,
He flitted frae his Seat, and youl'd again.

WATTIE.
I never like the mournfou Youls o' Dogs,
Or when there comes a singing in my Lugs;
Or when the Pyots flock upon the Houses,
A' these are Signs to ken before ill News is;
Sure it wad raise Affection in your Breast,
To see the Wit o' that sagacious Beast.

GIBBIE.
But I was sic a poor unthinking Ass,
I ne'er had Thought on what wad come to pass;
For I this Morning, in a mock Design,
Gae'd to an honest Neighbour Wife o' mine;
It was for Fun, because the Wife, it seems,
Professes ay great Skill in reading Dreams.
I tauld her mine, and naithing up did keep,
A' how I was forfairn in my Sleep.
The Words she said, I'll mind to my least Breath,
Preserve's, quoth she, and keep the Town frae Skaith;
Frae Desolation, Dearth, and sudden Death.
She shook her Head, and glowred wi' her Eyen
At me, and said, Young Man, ye've lost a Frien;
I leugh at a' she said, and ca'd it Bables,
'Cause I ne'er us'd to credit auld Wives Fables;
But to my Grief I sadly find it now,
That Luckie's Words hae come to pass o'er true.

WATTIE.
Ill News o'er soon came sounding in my Ears,
Which fills my Saul wi' Grief, and Eyen wi' Tears;
Dear Sany's Death has made my Heart as sad,
As what his Birth did make his Mither's glad.

GIBBIE.
Believe me, Wat, it's bred me mair Vexation,
Than gin he'd been my nearest Blood Relation.
For Neighbourhood nane better e'er had we,
Had ay good Havence, couthie, kind and free.
Poor Man, he's e'en awa, wha bure the Vog,
That ne'er sae meikle's wrang'd his Neighbour's Dog.

WATTIE.
Hegh hey, he is no poor now, for he, by Grace,
Has got his Portion in a better Place;
Better it is wi' him than me or you,
We're in the false Warld, he is in the true.

GIBBIE.
He was a Lad, it's Sin to lie o' the Dead,
Left few sic like behind him in his Stead:
Sen he and Pennycuik war tane awa,
Whar hae we now a Singer 'mang us a'?

WATTIE.
But very few that we can ca' our ain,
Amang us now belonging to our Plain;
I whiles hear tell of some Humdrums or ither,
That fain wad hae the Name, and be ca'd Brither;
Possess'd wi' Self-Conceit and warldly Greed,
That scarce can ken a Note, or tune a Reed;
Wails out, and steals awa our bonny Sangs,
Mix them wi' Nonsense, making loud Harangues;
Ca' them their ain, and syne make up a Buik,
To raise a Fame they ill deserve to bruik.

GIBBIE.
Fame got by Falset, whan it's brought to Light,
Will soon tak Wings, and bid them a' good Night;
And leave them stupid, nathing hae to say,
Mair than the Howlet at the Break o' Day;
'Come good for nought, but Ridicule and Scorn,
And whan the Cattle tread and eat the Corn,
To sing a Lypok, Link o' Berrie Horn.

WATTIE.
They are, at best, a vain conceity Gang,
A Crew that Sany ne'er wad haunt amang;
Nor sic Clanjamphray cou'd he e'er abide
To feed their Flocks ne'er by his Leazure Side;
Mony a Time has he and we thegither
Stood by, and seen, the Rabble fleg at ither;
Their common Law, sae far as I uptake,
Is, Let the stronger anes o'er-gae the weak;
And thole the wealthy, tho the stupidest,
To scourge and act as Hangmen to the rest.

GIBBIE.
And well cou'd Sany tent them on the Plain,
And mak bra Sport of them to us again;
Wad gar't ane laugh, and had a Spunk o' Life;
Baith Gentlefolks and semple did admire him,
And mony a ane has striven to be near him,
And thought their Time was happy spent to hear him.
Whamever he had chanc'd to be amang,
They ne'er cou'd trap him in a Word in Season,
And never tauld his Tale without a Reason;
Then he had sic a Way o' settin't aff,
Gar't them a tak the loud Tihee, and gaff.

WATTIE.
Na, he dang a for Sport I ever saw,
The Loss of him it makes a Day seem Twa,
'Mang a' our Herds his Word was ay a Law.
To Freits and Charms he never wad comply,
As Rawn-Tree Clubs for Eisning o' the Ky;
When he was ane, that baith cou'd say and do,
Whatever Thing his Fancy led him to;
Sagacious he behaved like a Lord,
For making Concord where he fand Discord.

GIBBIE.
What mean ye, Lad, by Discords and Concords?
Dear Wat, wha learn'd ye a' thae kittle Words?

WATTIE.
I'll warrant ye may eithly guess wham frae,
Sany that ken'd them a' and mony mae:
Ay whan he fand us like to disagree,
In ony Thing that seem'd to breed a Plea;
Whan ought fell in Debate, unlike to cease,
Sany was ay for making up o' Peace.
While whan our thraward Humours wad na jump,
Whan Tam was fought a Spring on Willie's Trump;
Whan Willie had refus'd, and said, I'll no,
Whan Rob wad ta'en a Kiss of Pattie's Jo;
Whan Pate wad looked like a putting Cow,
And said to Rob, and hung his glooming Brow,
Well, Lad, I hae a Craw to pluck wi' you.
These, and sic like, frae less to mair hae been,
Enough to raise a Quarrel on the Green:
Ye ken auld Nick is sic a cunning Thief,
Can make a wie Thing Mither of Mischief.

GIBBIE.
Ay, he's ay seeking wham he can devour,
The De'il's ay busie whar he can get Pow'r.

WATTIE.
Then Sany wad bang'd out his Pipe wi' Speed,
Or Stock and Horn, and tun'd his aeten Reed,
Play'd bonny Springs, that did our Fancies feed,
And gar't us a' shake Hands, and dance a Reel,
Gree'd a' good Friends, and swith'd awa the Deil.

GIBBIE.
Cou'd I speak as I wad do, I wad tell
How far he did in mony Things excel.
Our Laird cou'd never want him for his Jests,
At a' his blythsom Banquets and his Feasts:
He made and dress'd his Whistles right in Tune,
Play'd Strings that pleas'd his Honour right in Tune,
Ay whan his Gossips war conveen'd 'gain Night,
And got a Cleek o' Sany, a' was right;
The blythsom Bousers, thought while Sany sang,
They were mair happy than the Night was lang.
Whan he wad act'd the Wives in the West-Bow,
How Luckie reel'd the Yarn, and span the Tow;
Whan he wad act'd the Coal-Man, black Jock Smirny;
The Glasgow Wives, or Fiddler Patie Birny;
Then they was a' busst out a laughing sae,
Ane eithly might hae ty'd them wi' a Strae:
Forgat to sleep, or keek upon a Watch;
The langest Winter Night they thought but short,
Slaid saftly by, while Sany made them Sport.

WATTIE.
Well might they say, they never saw his Make.

GIBBIE.
Na, well I wat, nor nae Man for their Sake;
For taking up what he cou'd hear or see,
Whilk mony a Time a Ferlie was to me.

WATTIE.
Nathing gae'd cross-ways wi' him in his Life,
Save his Misfortune wi' a wicked W&mdash;;
As mony of our honest Neighbours says,
She was the Mean that cutted short his Days.
Cauld be her Cast, nae Pity on him had,
Depriv'd the Warld of sic a pleasant Lad.

GIBBIE.
Ay, well I wat she bred him meikle Sorrow,
The weary While he had her for his Marrow;
'Twas her camstairy Humour, Night and Day,
That brake his Heart, and threw him in Decay.

WATTIE.
Little thought I last Wednesday's Night at E'en,
Sic sudden Alteration wad be seen,
Whan Sany sang, Se merry's we hae been.
And blyth was I to see us a sae fain;
Sae merry I shall never be again.

GIBBIE.
It's hard to ken, ye may, gin ye be spar'd;
She's an auld Wife can her ain Forturne waird.

WATTIE.
It's no i' th' Pow'r of Nature e're to part
This Grief that lies sae heavy at my Heart.
O that I cou'd but utter my Design!
Or in a better Language speak my Mind.
My former Joys now yield me nought but Dust,
It's sair to thole, and yet it's what I must.
Nae Hopes of Comfort wi' me now remain,
A gloomy Darkness overclouds the Plain.
Spring Time is past, pale Winter fast ensuing,
To speir what youthfou Summer has been doing.
Look how the Willows droop, and hing their Heads;
Flora's withdrawn her Mantle frae the Meads.
The Flow'rs decay'd, whereon the busy Bees
Had wont to suck, and gather fresh Supplies.
Nae mair we'll hear them humming o'er the Fells,
Laden wi' Store, hame to their cozie Cells.
The Eastern Craggs, how dolefou-like they hing,
Where Sany us'd to tune his Voice and sing.
Alas!  when I look back on auld lang syne,
Mair I think on't, the mair I do repine,
I'll never get the Thoughts o't frae my Mind.

GIBBIE.
Wat, cast nae down thy Heart, nor hae sic Doubt,
Wha kens what Providence may bring about?
Some canny Cast may soon make a' Odds even,
Why shou'd we fret against the Will o' Heaven?
Wi' Patience bear, howe'er the Guise may fa',
A happy End will make amends for a'.
Now, let us part, we hae nae Time to wait,
The Night is darkning down, and wearing late.
Frae Maukin's Hill, and by the Broomland-but,
Our Flocks are gath'ring near the Roading-foot;
The Stars, that bid the Shepherds fauld, appear.
Reik me my Kent, and let us hameward steer.
