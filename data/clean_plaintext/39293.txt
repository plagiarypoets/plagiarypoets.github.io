While skill'd in baneful arts th' enchantress tries
Thy dear Florella, Spenser, to chastize,
A nymph of snow she forms with nicest care,
And decks with ev'ry grace th' imagin'd fair,
Where all Florella's beauties seem'd confess'd,
Her voice, complexion, easy shape express'd!
More still this fictious charmer to complete,
She added graceful movements to her feet.
Struck like Ixion with this idol belle,
How many a hero in fierce combat fell!
But when the native fair advanc'd in view
The false by melting quickly own'd the true,
In sparkling drops distil her shining eyes,
And on her cheeks each transient beauty dies.
Vain all attempts to rival nature's charms,
Since native beauty magic power disarms.
