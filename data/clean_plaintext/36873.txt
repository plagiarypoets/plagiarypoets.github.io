Blest with each Art, and ev'ry power to Please,
Receive the Bard who charm'd in former Days;
His practic'd Muse shews love consuming Fires,
And paints that Passion the bright Form inspires.
No vulgar Jests in those soft Numbers mix,
No biting Sneer to ridicule the Sex;
From Nature's great Original he drew,
These radiant Graces that survive in you.
In tender Strains his melting Verses flow,
And idoliz'd those Charms that caus'd his Woe,
As the brave Leander overthrown in Flight,
Yields just Applause, and owns the Victor's might.
Peruse the Bard, his pleasing Paths pursue,
Imperial Beauties, sov'reign Triumphs view;
To Love's bright Queen, how mighty King's submit,
And haughty Warriors fall beneath her Feet.

O cou'd my Muse boast Waller's Airs divine,
Spencer's sweet Note, or Lansdown's flowing Line;
To endless Time thy lovely Name shou'd live,
And latest Ages loud Applauses give;
Yet soft, as fair, this humble Verse receive,
From one untaught, unpractis'd to deceive,
While pond'rous Coke confounds that lively Brain,
Long us'd to Pope and Shakespear's lofty Strain.

May guardian Angels that bright Form defend,
From ev'ry Care, and evermore attend;
May each swift Hour succeeding Raptures bring,
And Time proceed on Pleasures balmy Wing;
May ev'ry Transport crown thy close of Life,
The fairest Mistress and the truest Wife;
Which still shall charm whatever Fate attend,
Thy faithful Servant, and sincerest Friend.
