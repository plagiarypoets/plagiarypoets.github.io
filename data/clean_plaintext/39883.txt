See &mdash; from the sterile soil enrich'd with care,
From verdant borders of the fruitful plain,
From lowly plants, &mdash; from trees that wave in air,
From long-drawn vistas bright with golden grain,
From the fair range of cultur'd earth's domain,
When o'er her breast the plenteous harvest springs,
Hills fresh with dew, &mdash; or vallies soft with rain,
Her varied tribute Agriculture brings
To cheer the heart of man, and praise the King of Kings.

As when Judea's Kings for solemn feast
First herds requir'd from willing subjects hands,
To Levites' knife, or sacrificing priest
They pour'd innumerous from the fertile lands;
So now they throng in multifarious bands:&mdash;
Bleat not, ye flock &mdash; nor shrink ye lowing train,
No altar's rites your sinless blood demands,
Led by the kind hand of the gentle swain,
Behold the peaceful sports of Ceres' bounteous reign.

Haste! &mdash; Speed the Plough! &mdash; Upturn with glittering share
The deep drawn furrow. &mdash; Ye who scornful view
Toil's hardy sons in manly effort dare,
Bear hence your sneer, &mdash; this scene is not for you.&mdash;
Hence, to the listless, enervated crew,
With silken forms by wan diseases riven,
Whose Pride withholds from industry its due;
Think ye, a life to useful labor given,
Not more than sloth's dull sleep shall please the eye of Heaven?
