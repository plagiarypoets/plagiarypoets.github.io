Folly, cease thy noisy bell,
And shake no more thy nodding plumes at me:
No mirror may'st thou see
On the rude wall of this sequester'd cell.
Hence, and thy worthless toys display
Where two-fac'd Flatt'ry gilds the bust of Pride.
Or where thy meteors glide
In countless swarms, the Giddy and the Gay.
In these still shades the blust'ring roar
Of Ignorance perverse, the vain man's lye,
And fawning Treachery,
No more deceive me, and disgust no more.

With eye serene and bosoms bare,
And brows uncharacter'd with care,
Come, gentle Peace, and Leisure free,
Daughters of Philosophy,
And lodge beneath this living screen,
Of Olive mild, and Myrtle green;
Near where flows a native rill,
Freely wand'ring where it will;
On whose grassy-fringed side
Dwells the humble Daisy py'd;
And the light fays in mingled dance
O'er the green turf featly glance.

Or if the still-air'd Ev'ning leads
Thro' the cowslip-breathing meads,
Let us, while ladies in twilight grey
The gleam that clos'd the parting day,
Pursue fair Fancy, where she roves,
Thro' golden vales, and spicy groves.

Or does inspiring Autumn shed
The glories of her yellow head?
Calmly studious shall we stray
O'er the leafy-matted way?
Oft list'ning, as we steal along,
The music of the plaintive song.

Hence let me the rude paths explore
That winding scale yon mountain hoar.
Nor might the toil be counted vain,
If yet Euterpe wakes her strain,
By no vulgar eye survey'd,
Far within th' woodland glade.
If yet perchance I found the cell,
Where Wisdom's aweful parents dwell;
Permitted free my mind to store
With their Heav'n-suggested lore.

These, O Solitude divine!
Pleasures such as these are thine.
Hackthorn!  well thy shades shall please,
Thine are pleasures such as these.
