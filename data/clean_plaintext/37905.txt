O gentle Sleep!  Shall the rude voice
Of sober dulness, whose cold thought
Muses on golden dross and vulgar joys,
Shall such rude voice condemn thy peaceful reign!

What though, before the bright-hair'd morn
In glory walks the Eastern hills,
Swift from his bed of care the poor-rich man
Starts, and renews the drudge of each dull day;

Shall I, lov'd sleep, whose idle thought
E'er loves the airy wilds to roam
Of fancy, shall I blame thine opiate power,
And burst thy silken bands, and fly from peace?

No gentle sleep!  the while the world
Renews at earliest morn the toil
Of empty cares &mdash; then I on down diffus'd
With thee will pass the hours in visions fair.

How sweet when Winter's fleecy snows
From the low clouds steal silent, soft,
And whiten the cold earth, that bloom'd so late
Hill, vale, and grove in liveliest green array'd;

How sweet to ope my heavy eyes
And thro' the window glaz'd to view
The fleecy snows, the whiten'd earth &mdash; then bless my couch,
And steal again to rest, and gentle dreams.

For fancy wild, that never sleeps,
To sunny climes, to streams and shades
Wanton shall fly; where breathes its airy tones
The Aeolian harp, by zephyrs lightly fann'd,

Where golden fruits and purple wines
Glow to the eye; where Delia's form
Shall brighten thro' the grove, like those soft powers
Wood-nymph or goddess, or like the first fair,

Eve, &mdash; who in Eden's hallow'd bowers
The Father of Mankind encharm'd.
Instant I fly, all fir'd, to those white arms,
To that white breast of love; &mdash; with tenderest voice

What though she chide each wanton kiss
And murmur anger in sweet sighs;&mdash;
Yet shall her yielding charms with happiest joy
Bless my warm vows, my fondest wishes bless.
