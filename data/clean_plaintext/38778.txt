From gayer scenes, where Pleasure's mad career
Infects the milder avenues of thought,
Where secret Envy swells the note of Fear,
And Hope is in its own illusion caught;

Where, in Ambition's thorny path of power,
Contending votaries bow to toils of State,
I turn, regardless of the passing hour,
To trace the havock of avenging Fate.

Ne'er may the wanton love of active life
Control the sager prescript of repose!
Ne'er may the murmurs of tumultuous strife,
Wreck the tranquility of private woes!

Here, on the crumbling relick of a stone,
On which the pride of masonry has smil'd,
Here, am I won't to ruminate alone,
And pause, in Fancy's airy robe beguil'd.

Disparting time the tower of ages bends,
Forms, and indignant sinks, the proudest plan;
O'er the neglected path the weed extends,
Nor heeds the wandering step of thoughtful man.

Here expiation murder has appeas'd,
Treason and homicide have been forgiven;
Pious Credulity her votaries eas'd,
Nor blam'd the indulgent Majesty of Heaven.

Some erring matron has her crimes disclos'd;
Some father, conscious of awakening fate,
Safe from revenge has innocence repos'd,
Unseen and undisturb'd at other's hate.

Sated with conquest from the noise of arms
The aged warrior with his fame retir'd,
Careless of thirsty spoil, of war'd alarms,
Nor with imperial emulation fir'd.

Where once her orisons Devotion paid,
By fear, or hope, or reverence, inspir'd,
The sad solicitude of youth allay'd,
And age in resignation calm attir'd.

The harmless cottager, from winds severe,
His humble habitation oft hath made;
Once gloomy Penitence sat silent there,
And midnight tapers gleam'd along the shade.

The lonely shepherd here has oft retir'd,
To count his flock, and tune his rustic lay,
Where loud Hosannahs distant ears inspir'd,
And saintly vesper clos'd the solemn day.
