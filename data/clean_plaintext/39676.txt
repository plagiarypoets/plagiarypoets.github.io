Adieu, sweet poesy, adieu, my lyre;
Far other calls must now divide my life;
See justice beckons from her awful seat,
Midst crowds of subtle managers of strife.

She tells me, ye are triflers light and vain;
And tho' ye may not misbecome the youth,
When manhood sows his seeds upon the brow,
Should cede to reason and her sister truth.

She points to where her darling Alfred stands,
Bids my researches his designs pervade:
And, wrapt in awe and admiration view,
How deep by wisdom her foundation's laid.

Farewel then simple Geoffrey, favour'd Pope,
My gentle Edmund, and my tutor Young;
Farewel, my much-lov'd Shakespear
Farewel to all that wit or fancy sung.

Ye triflers of my youth, too long ye've reign'd;
Now sager authors shall supply your place:
Amidst the first see Good-man Hale advance,
Reflection's son, with slow and solemn pace.

Hail rev'rend Coke!  law's first-born dearest child,
Thou ever shalt my most attention claim;
Hail honest Salkeld, Ventris, Littleton,
"Cum multis al'," too tedious now to name.

With reverence I'll mark each sacred page,
Mark how this circumstance with that agrees;
While deep-read Harrison, good-natur'd man,
Shall name the offices, their clerks, and fees.

And if perchance bewilder'd in a maze,
Far from the right my footsteps devious stray,
The letter'd Coke, the student's ablest friend,
Will kindly point and put me in the way.
