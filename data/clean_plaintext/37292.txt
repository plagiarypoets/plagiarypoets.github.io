Amazing Genius!  say if Scotia's land
So poor, so small, could not thy mind contain?
Or priz'd the Britons not those talents grand
Whic pour'd each lustre o'er the western main?
Europe thy like will ne'er behold again;
Ungrateful Europe!  whom thou shouldst command!
Well!  let her sons in ignorance remain,
So Yankees swallow thy instruction bland!
Yankees!  a noble, brave and generous band,
Fond of all matters that come over sea&mdash;
And ever prone to stretch a helping hand
To ALL &mdash; save native wit and industry.
RAMSAY!  o'erjoyed, we pin our faith on thee:&mdash;
And bless thee for thy lectures on anatomy!
