Coy Spirit of the cave!  Sweet Echo, hail!
Responsive to the softly sighing breeze,
As on thy gentle ear
Its mournful murmurs swell.

Thee oft, perhaps, some lonely virgin haunts
To tell her cherish'd grief, her slighted vows;
Or, chaunt her vesper hymn
Along these twilight groves.

Sequestered LEISURE, fondly here retreats
From toiling Care, and Folly's idling train;
Retreats with chasten'd TASTE,
And lovely SCIENCE join'd:

Here sits, and muses, while young Morning dawns
With faintly gleaming lustre; and the skies
With mild and genial breath,
Diffuse refreshment round;

While woods hoarse-rustle to the the sighing gales;
And, warbling in the dewy shades, the birds
With prompted joy, salute
The kindling Day's return.

Lingering, he loves to catch thy accents clear
As Eve looks pensive thro' the fading clouds
Or, o'er the glimmering scene
Her dusky shadows draws.

Then, distant bleatings from the fragrant fold,
Or, sacred chimes from tree-embosom'd tower,
His soften'd soul inspire
With saintly, calm delight.
