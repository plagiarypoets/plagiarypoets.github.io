The spring it is coming on fast,
The birds they are percht on the sprays,
The wintery frosts they are past,
The shepherds are tuning their lays.

The trees are cover'd with leaves,
The ground it is cheerfully green,
But still the lost Corydon grieves,
For Phillis is not to be seen.

The daisey is raising its head,
The golden-cups cover the ground;
See my heards on the meadow are spread,
See my flocks they are feeding around.

But my heards they no longer delight,
Nor my flocks can give pleasure to me;
For say, is the daisey so white?
Or the golden-cup brighter than she?

My mind it is tortur'd with doubt,
My breast is tormented with fear;
Like a madman I run all about,
And I ramble I do not know where.

I sleep not a wink all the night,
And my days they do dolefully pass;
'Till I see her (oh!  exquisite sight!)
Come tripping it over the grass.

Oh!  say, can'st thou hear me complain,
Nor list to thy shepherd so true?
Oh!  come, and give life to the swain
Who now is a dying for you.

No hurt, my sweet Phillis shall ail,
By Venus the goddess I vow;
For whilst I am holding the pail,
Why &mdash; she shall be milking her cow.
