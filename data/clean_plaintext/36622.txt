How beautiful is Ocean!  By its tide,
As though my sandals to the beach were grown,
I've staid, when first the Indian was descried,
Till her firm anchor over deck was thrown;
Her name, her mariners to me unknown;
Yet, to an ardent gaze, it might appear
As though she felt this kingdom were her own;
And with augmented energies did steer,
Touch'd by the loadstone home, that lay so near.

Driving impetuous as the mountain bird,
That left her offspring in its lofty crest;
And when returning near, some sound has heard,
Or sign has noticed of her eyrie's nest,
The natural impulse glowing in her breast;
Through the blue ether faster on she springs,
Nor turns aside for prey, nor stoops to rest,
Till the hard rock has felt her beating wings,
And the young eaglet to her bosom clings.

Blue skies were then above me, and the deep
Seemed hushed and cradled for a summer's rest;
Fixed in its beauty, as a babe asleep,
Who smiles unchanging in its pearly vest,
Or dimples, as the zephyrs fan its breast.
These were bright moments (oh, remembered well!)
When I came thither an enamour'd guest,
And almost listened for the sea-maid's shell,
And all the enchanting sounds of which youth's legends tell.
