But having toucht the Braine, the Soule, the Will,
(All which (save the soule) can brooke no touch)
It rests that Reason's heasts wee doe fulfil,
To prosecute much more, or more then much,
That Witt for Will wil willingly avouch:
Th' al-giving Giver giveth al that live
(His Creatures) such desires, and Natures such;
As for their good wil stil should strive,
And shun what ere should them of it deprive.
