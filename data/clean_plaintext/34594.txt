When bold Columbus, o'er th' Atlantic Main,
To fabled Climes his daring Sail unfurl'd,
And now prepar'd the wondrous Strand to gain;
Uprose the Genius of the western World:
Bright to the Sun his feathery Crown display'd
A thousand Hues, high-beaming o'er his Head;
Some wisard Hand his barbarous Robe portray'd,
Where Cities blaz'd, and Montezuma bled:
As stern he trod, his Giant-quiver rung,
And thus to Seas and Shores prophetic Sounds he sung.

My Spicy Groves in vain old Ocean hides
Far in the Bosom of his Billows hoar;
Mid the vast Barrier of surrounding Tides,
In vain my Mountains flame with latent Ore:
In dark Retirements of my trackless Shades
Though Nature holds at large her lonely Reign,
Her deep Repose rash Avarice invades;
I mark the Rapine of the Slaves of Gain,
Hear with new Din my pine-capt Caverns roar,
And see my Cataracts unseemly stream with Gore.

Yet deem not, Strangers, that in happy Hour
Ye stem by Bays sequester'd.  Conquest new
Shall shake by turns each proud Usurper's Power:
Nor breathe my Groves, nor glow my Mines for you.
What though, with many a Shriek, and dismal Yell,
My quiver'd Gods with Bows of Ebon break;
And specious Arts, from Den, or leafy Cell,
At length must lure my guiless Natives meek?
Yet Heaven to distant Times the Wreath ordains
Of Him whose final Sway shall claim my destin'd Plains.

Lo, then whate'er old Bards, in mystic Lore,
Of Regions blest, Hesperian Coasts, have told,
In me shall be reveal'd.  From Shore to Shore,
From Pole to Pole, one Empire I behold!
From Albion's Cliffs a mighty King shall send
Secure Dominion:  mid the brave Career,
Howe'er to Death his honoured Eld descend,
A youthful Prince shall seize his massy Spear,
Shall rise his Grandsire's conquering Race to run,
To rule, to bless, the Realms the hoary Warriour won.
