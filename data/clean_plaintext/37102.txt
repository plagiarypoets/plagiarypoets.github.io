Come! &mdash; in thy flowing locks and artless dress,
More beauteous than the poet Venus shews;
Thy genuine feelings let thy tongue express,
Since candour in thy bosom ever glows;
Come! &mdash; and in open day assert thy right
Man to reform, to polish, and delight.

She comes! &mdash; a blaze of glory decks the scene;
Congenial virtues on her steps attend;
Graceful her form, her countenance serene;
Her great design our morals to attend:
On truth's mild brows she fixes honour's crown,
Whilst vice and folly tremble at her frown.

Falsehood retires, his pallid cheeks declare
The deep remorse which preys upon his heart;
The gentle soother of the good and fair
Tears from his brow the insidious mask of art.
That rage is shewn, which lurked within his breast,
And the detested monster stands confess'd.

Ah!  whence that shriek? &mdash; It vibrates on my ear,
More loudly than the thunder's awful peal&mdash;
But now my bosom is reliev'd from fear,
Since scandal is in turn compell'd to feel
Grief and distress &mdash; She seems to sink to hell,
There with congenial fiends condemned to dwell.

Merit steps forth; his ready hand is grasped,
By the mild dame, who fondly owns her heir;
Religion in her strict embrace is clasped,
And in her smiles each art and science share.
Genius appears, in native radiance bright,
Hails the blest power, and mingles light with light.

Guide of my youth, to thee I ever bow'd;
Whate'er my follies, still I ow'd thy sway:
I scorned the mean, insidious, flattering crowd;
Intent to thee my purest vows to pay.
Sincerity!  still o'er my breast preside;
My boast on earth! &mdash; to heaven, I trust, my guide!
