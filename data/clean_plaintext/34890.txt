Methought I saw the grave where heavenly Gray,
Mantled in black oblivion, calmly slept;
O'er the damp turf in deepest sorrow lay
The Muse, and her immortal minion wept:
In vain, from Harewood's tangled allies wild,
Devonia's virgins breath'd the choral song;
In vain, from Mona's precipices pil'd,
Hoar Mador's harp its shrilling echo rung.&mdash;
When, sudden-stealing o'er the welkin wide,
New magic strains were heard from Isis' verge,
The mourning maid forgot her funeral dirge,
And smiling sweet, as erst, with conscious pride,
Press'd from her auburn hair the nightly dew,
And trimm'd her wreath of hyacinth anew.
