Hark!  how the Sabbath bells salute the sky,
Inviting all to seek the house of prayer;
I from my window, cast a mournful eye
On crowds, who to these hallowed courts repair;
And think, how I had wont to mingle there:
Yet He whose presence fills created space,
Can shed His light to soothe my hours of care;
And make my chamber His appointed place
Where heavenly Truth shall shine, imparting promised grace.

Yes, He whose presence was a cloud by day,
A fiery pillar each revolving night;
In dens of death the lion's rage could stay;
And change the furnace to celestial light;
Who could arrest the angry prophet's flight,
And heard his prayer from Ocean's depths profound;
Can make my evening, as the morning bright
Chase every grief; and bind each aching wound;
Can whisper Peace and Love, diffusing gladness round.

And He whose hand His chosen people led,
Who in the desert, could their wants supply;
Who in the wilderness, His prophet fed,
When Nature pined beneath a parching sky;
Who does not slight the hungry raven's cry;
And clothes the spotless lilies of the field;
Will not to Man his gracious aid deny,
But from His stores each needful comfort yield,
His hand with plenty filled; His arm a constant shield.

Almighty Father!  hear my humble prayer!
My sins forgive; increase my faith in Thee,
Who say'st, 'Commit thy Orphans to my care,
And let thy mourning Widow trust in Me.'
My soul from doubt, my heart from care set free;
Support and guide me, on my weary way:
And in this world, a Friend, and Father be,
To those who sigh above my breathless clay;
And let us part in hope, to meet in brighter day!
