Who is this thilke old bard which wonneth here?
This thilke old bard, sirs, is Dan Chaucer:
Full gentle knight was he, in very sooth,
Albee a little japeish in his youth.
He karoll'd deftly to his new psautry,
And eke couth tellen tales of jollity,
And sangs of solace, all the livelong day,
Soote as the ouzel or throstell in May.
Withouten words mo, a merie maker he,
No hopen I his permagall to see.
Ne Johnny Gay, perdie, ne Matthew Prior,
In diting tales of pleasaunce couth go higher,
Here in this gardyn full of glowers gend,
Betwixt his elder-tree, and fresh woodbend,
He hearkeneth the foules' assemblie,
That fro' the twigs maken their melodie.
Ye pied daisies, spring neath his feet,
Who song so sootly, "The daisy is so sweet:"
And whilest, "benedicite," he sings,
Ryn, little beck, in silver murmurings,
O pleasaunt poete, thyselven solace here,
And merie be thy heart, old Dan Chaucer.
