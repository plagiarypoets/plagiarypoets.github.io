The octave rhyme (Ital. ottava rima)
Is a delightful measure made of ease
Turn'd up with epigram, and, tho' it seem a
Verse that a man may scribble when he please,
Is somewhat difficult; indeed, I deem a
Stanza like Spenser's will be found to teaze
Less, or heroic couplet; there, the pen
May touch and polish and touch up again.

But, for the octave measure &mdash; it should slip
Like running water o'er its pebbled bed,
Making sweet music, (here I own I dip
In Shakspeare for a simile) and be fed
Freely, and then the poet must not nip
The line, nor square the sentence, nor be led
By old, approved, poetic canons; no,
But give his words the slip, and let 'em go.

I mean to give in this same pleasant rhyme
Some short account of Don Diego de
Montilla, quite a hero in his time,
Who conquer'd captain Cupid as you'll see:
My tale is sad in part, in part sublime,
With here and there a smack of pleasantry:
As to the moral, why &mdash; 'tis under cover.
I leave it for the reader to discover....
