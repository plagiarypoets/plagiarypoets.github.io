There 'tis my joy, at silent evening's close,
To rest my wearied soul in sweet repose.
To leave the world, its vices, far behind;
To exercise alone the spacious mind;
O'er the historic page instructive pore;
Or with "divine philosophy" to soar:
Hear Shakspeare's voice, or, heav'nly Milton, thine,
And trace a master's hand in every line;
Or with delightful Spenser ever gay,
Sport in the throngs of gallant festive day;
Or picture in my mind some blessed isle,
Where man upon his brother learns to smile;
Where all partake, enjoy an equal good;
Where want, or wealth is little understood;
Where friend in friend can always sure confide,
And charity prevails in place of pride.
Where noble youth, and truly reverend age,
With patriot love, and gentle peace engage....
