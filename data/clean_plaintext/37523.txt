Descend!  descend, ye heav'nly nine,
Descend, and sing the praise of Tyne:
Whose sons, in awful state,
Like to mighty heroes sate:
Without drum,
Aw'd the scum,
Who presum'd of Wilkes to prate.
For us, and those that bear the sway,
Blest guardians of this isle,
Jove lights each morn the lamp of day,
And makes creation smile.
Happy, happy, happy race,
None but the slave,
None but the slave,
None but the slave,
None but the slave procures a place.
CHOR. Happy, &amp;c.

C&mdash;ton's widow, high in grace,
Amidst the courtier's stand,
Swaying the mighty sceptre of the land:
She speaks, and quick th' etherial space
Bounds, as with light'ning, at her high command.
Our song began from B&mdash;te,
Who left a ragged rebel rout,
And made the Court his sole pursuit:
To C&mdash;n's presence soon he press'd,
He sigh'd, and wish'd her to his breast.
The accents that so loosely hung,
At last escap'd his fault'ring tongue.
The amorous dame admir'd the pleasing sound,
She felt the power of love, she beat the ground,
And gave him might above the head that's crown'd.
With ardent eyes,
His Lordship cries,
"Observe my nod,
I bear the rod!
And soon will shake the earth and skies."
CHOR.  With arden eyes, &amp;c.

To G&mdash;n next our praises we will bring,
'Tis G&mdash;n, second favourite of the K&mdash;.
The sprightly Lord, lo!  yonder stands,
Whilst slaves await his high commands:
Ah!  mighty looks his Grace,
Majestic seems his face,
Which strikes with terror the remotest lands.
G&mdash;n, active, bold, and young,
Gambling pleasures will sustain;
G&mdash;n's genius is a treasure,
Tricking is the gamester's pleasure.
Rich the treasure,
Great the pleasure,
Sweet's the horse-race dash'd with gain.
'Tis he that seiz'd elections, to destroy;
His bravery led the way,
He made of liberty, a prey;
And, like another Helen, fir'd another Troy.
CHOR.  'Tis he that seiz'd, &amp;c.

The praise of N&mdash;th, can we forget to bring?
No &mdash; gratitude commands his praise to sing.
To N&mdash;th alone we owe our greatest good,
He scatters treasures rapid as the flood:
'Tis but obedience he commands,
With this he's sated, and no more demands.
Around his eye-balls play
Lustres more radiant than the new-born day;
His douceurs, and this dazzling light,
The Senators surround,
Their ideas quite confound,
And often make them swear, that black is white.
CHOR.  His douceurs, &amp;c.

Sweet Cecilia, come along,
Aid us in our sacred song.
Hark!  the voice of faction swells on high;
Thus the Patriots sing &mdash; thus yell and cry:
To Wilkes our greatest bliss we owe,
Friend of Freedom, slav'ry's foe:
Not to the detested Thane,
Brunswick's subtle bosom bane:
Not to G-ton's gambling pate,
Horned locust of the state:
Not to Bullface Doublefee,
Nurtur'd imp of Satan's knee:
Not to Sawney Weathercock,
Judas of the Scottish flock.&mdash;
These, and all the Carlton crew,
Black REBELLION, are for you.
