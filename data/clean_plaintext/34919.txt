See the sweet bard that erst by Mulla's side,
A dainty spirit, mus'd on mortal pride;
Where oft the touching tale of private woe
Taught the fine harp the melancholy flow;
Where in sublimer grief he wept the doom
Of elder Babylon, or imperial Rome;
Or a true Briton told to list'ning Fame,
In bleeding words, the fall of Verulam.
In such a noble mood now Spencer seems,
As when he form'd in Fancy's fairy dreams
The living draught of Gloriana's days,
When heroes earn'd renown, and poets knew to praise. . . .
