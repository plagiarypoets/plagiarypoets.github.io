No more of times, when from yon magic chair,
Planted on rocks stupendous &mdash; I descended,
Oblivious to mortal sight &mdash; so thick a film
Has clouded human vision, and deprav'd
Sin &mdash; caus'd:  yet not the less urge I the task
Assign'd me, and all the inferior spirits curb
To work our high benevolence on man:
On him, who, o'er the foaming surf light borne,
Unconscious as the Bark he guides, passes
Regardless of those legions ministrant,
Who in the cool stream lave their shining limbs,
And on the ebbing wave, as on a couch,
Pendant repose delighted.  Nor unapt,
Nor unimportant to material mold
This spiritual knowledge, since from thence
Startled humanity, who plunges deep
Into the dashing surge, after some wreck,
And on his shoulders, to the hapless shore
Bears life suspended &mdash; may be taught to think
Thousands of aiding forms around him glide,
Supply his wasting spirits, and the nerves
Slacken'd, rebrace with energy unknown.
And full of need, my unrelenting guard,
Sublimely plac'd, where I may view afar
Aught perilous to his who rules this soil,
CORINCUS &mdash; He, coming with Trojan BRUTE,
Who fled by sea for SYLVIUS, his sire,
With undesigned aim pierced by his shaft,
Took, as by lot, the wide extended plain
Below this mount; his chief delight to chase
And tame within their dens a giant Brood,
Fiercer than those titancan, whom they fable
Strove once with JOVE:  These buried deep in caves
From day, that shames their toils, by magic spells
Create an artificial light metallic, which
Their earthly spirits at such grand behests
Win from the tortur'd earth, and, purg'd by flame,
In liquid sheets resplendent mirrors cast
Of mineral malleable, such as bears
Superior polish, and reflects around
The glowing treasures of their vast domain.
Yet not the fear of this bold Trojan's arm,
Nor of the powers divine, compels them there
To find perpetual empire; oft emerging
When sullen darkness in his gathering spleen
Blots out the lights of Heav'n, and hideous Tempest,
His near ally, howls on the waste of waves;
Then o'er the changing cliffs they speed their way,
And bathe in human blood their horrid fangs,
The life of wretches, by the boiling wave
Dash'd on the shore.
