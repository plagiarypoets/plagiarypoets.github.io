My Lord
Soe subject to the worser fame
Are even the best that clayme a Poets name:
Especially poore they that serve the stage
Though worthily in this Verse-halting Age.
And that dread curse soe heavie yet doth lie
Which the wrong'd Fates falne out with Mercurie
Pronounc'd for ever to attend upon
All such as onely dreame of Helicon.
That durst I sweare cheated by selfe opinion
I were Apolloes or the Muses Mynion
Reason would yet assure me, 'tis decreed
Such as are Poets borne, are borne to need.
If the most worthy then, whose pay's but praise
Or a few spriggs from the now withering bayes
Grone underneath their wants what hope have I
Scarce yet allowed one of the Company&mdash;
Of better fortune, That with their good parts
Even want the wayes the bold and thriving arts
By which they grow remarkable and are priz'd
Since sure I could not live a thing despiz'd
Durst I professe t'were in my power to give
A patron that should ever make him live&mdash;
Or tell great Lords that the maine Reason why
They hold A Poets prayses flatterie
Is their owne guilt, that since they left to doo
Things worthy praise even praise is odious too&mdash;
Some few there are that by this boldnes thrive
Which yet I dare not follow; others strive
In some high mynded Ladies grace to stand
Ever provided that her liberall hand
Pay for the Vertues they bestow upon her
And soe long shees the miracle and the honor
Of her whole Sex, and has forsooth more worth
Then was in any Sparta e're brought forth
But when the Bounty failes a change is neare
And shee's not then what once shee did appeare
For the new Giver shee dead must inherit
What was by purchase gott and not by merit
Lett them write well that doo this and in grace
I would not for a pension or A place
Part soe with myne owne Candor, lett me rather
Live poorely on those toyes I would not father
Not knowne beyond A Player or A Man
That does pursue the course that I have ran
Ere soe grow famous:  yet with any paine
Or honest industry could I obteyne
A noble Favorer, I might write and doo
Like others of more name and gett one too
Or els my Genius is false.  I know
That Johnson much of what he has does owe
To you and to your familie, and is never
Slow to professe it, nor had Fletcher ever
Such Reputation, and credit nonne
But by his honord Patron, Huntington
Unimitable Spencer ne're had been
Soe famous for his matchlesse Fairie Queene
Had he not found a Sydney to preferr
His plaine way in his Shepheards Calender
Nay Virgills selfe (or Martiall does lye)
Could hardly frame a poore Gnatts Elegie
Before Mecaenas cherisht him; and then
He streight conceiv'd Aeneas and the men
That found out Italic  Those are Presidents
I cite with reverence:  my lowe intents
Looke not soe high, yet some worke I might frame
That should nor wrong my duty nor your Name.
Were but your Lordship pleas'd to cast an eye
Of favour on my trodd downe povertie
How ever I confesse myselfe to be
Ever most bound for your best charitie
To others that feed on it, and will pay
My prayers with theirs that as you doe you may
Live long, belov'd and honor'd doubtles then
Soe cleere a life will find a worthier Penn.
For me I rest assur'd besides the glory
T'wold make a Poet but to write your story.

Phill: Messinger.
