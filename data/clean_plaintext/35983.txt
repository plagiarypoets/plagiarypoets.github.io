Three angel graces were there in her traine,
The which to Resignation would she lend
Her heart in hour of sorrow to sustain,
And prove how far, above all earthly friend,
Her power to aid the humble doth extend.
Twaine of these graces must on earth abide
Whilest man remains, the child of sin and woe,
Then cease their being:  but the third shall guide
Man to heaven's gates, and, entering there, shall know
Eternity's full joys, that never cease to grow.

The first of stature tall and stately mien,
With strong impression waked the awe-struck mind;
Upon a bleeding cross she lov'd to lean;
To pensive musing did she seem inclin'd,
And solemn was her voice, yet wond'rous kind;
In her right hand a sacred cup she bore,
The which she offered to the wounded breast,
Albeit suffering with guilt's cruel sore,&mdash;
Who drank this sov'reign balm, its power confest,
And hail'd the promis'd dawn of everlasting rest.

And on this dame there did a damsel wait&mdash;
Yclad she was in garb of sober brown;
Steady, yet cheerful, was her gentle gait,
Ne ever did she laugh, ne ever frown;
Her face was fair, as is the cygnet's down;
Her voice was meek, like to the constant dove;
Nor smiles, nor tears, dwelt in her artless eye;
Tho' all her deeds were charity and love:
Such was this damsel faire, yclep'd Tranquility.

And Resignation, with this handmaid, sought
No higher bliss than in this bower to dwell;
Save when one visitant celestial brought
Such store of comfort to her modest cell,
Scarce heaven itself that blessing could excel:&mdash;
From God's own throne this guest derived her birth,
And with his glorious beauty was she dight;
And thence was sent to bless the gladden'd earth
With beams above the sun's meridian bright:
Such was this wonderous guest, Religion hight.
