The star of love on evening's brow hath smil'd,
Showering her golden influence with her beam;
Hush'd is the ocean wave, and soft and mild
The breathing zephyr; lull'd is every stream,
Placid and gentle as a vestal's dream;
The bard of night, the angel of the spring,
O'er the wild minstrels of the grove supreme,
Near his betrothed flower expands his wing;
Wake, lovely rose, awake, and hear thy poet sing!

The night is past; wake &mdash; Queen of every flower,
Breathing the soul of spring in thy perfume;
The pearls of morning are thy wedding dower,
Thy bridal garment is a robe of bloom!
Wake lovely flower!  for now the winter's gloom
Hath wept itself in April showers away;
Wake lovely flower!  and bid thy smiles assume
A kindred brightness with the rosy ray,
That streaks the floating clouds with the young blush of day.
