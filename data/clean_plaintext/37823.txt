As Roman sailors ofttimes in a squall
Vowed, if they 'scaped the fury of the breeze,
To hang their breeches on the temple wall,
And offering to the Monarch of the seas;
So I, whom still these ancient models please,&mdash;
The vesture changed, the sentiment the same,&mdash;
Now that the day has come when I must cease
To bear a Glasgow student's honour'd name,
For thee, poor badge, whose hue of dingy flame
Scarce tells the colour that thou once hast been,
A peg behind my study-door would claim
Where thou mayst hang, and mid the varied scene
Of after-life recall the eventful hours
Spent 'mid the noise and smoke of these time-honour'd towers.
