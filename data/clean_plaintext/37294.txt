'Tis Night &mdash; and now the scowling sky comes down
In one wild blast that hurls its load of snow;
Darkness and death!  the air is all a frown,
The storm is pelting, and the winds they blow!
So dark, the traveller might only know,
By the white robe upon him thickening fast,
What enemy was warring on him so;
And as he casts his eye down, fears the blast
His limbs is bleaching, starts, and hurries o'er the waste.

But even now his heart is fluttering,
To feel the storm his mortal mansion rack,
To see the tempest out upon the wing,
And feel it fling his mantle to his back;
But nothing to the traveller seems to make
So close his vestments cling, his heart so warm,
As that which wraps its flutterings to partake
Of the congenial spirit of the storm,
Until he sees, and shrinks, abroad the Almighy's form.

Again it raves itself to ease &mdash; again
It comes as if "'twould crack its cheeks," and heav'n
Had wag'd to lay earth's honors on the plain:
By the wild wind the birds are chased and driv'n;
Loud cracks the oak, a sign that he has giv'n
His honors over to the furious foe;
Again it comes, it comes, &mdash; 'tis burst, 'tis riven
From all the thousand ties that chained below,
And from its venerable base of long ago.

O!  wind, that art the poet's element; &mdash; O!  thou,
That art the fanning of his restless deep;
The goaded fancy longs to burst the brow,
And beats against the boundaries that would keep
It from its fellow bird before the sweep
Of tempest, tost and bandied in the sky,
Till in its headlong haste, it fain would leap
Itself, and lost in liberty to fly,
Would wing its way to heav'n and win eternity.
