Avert, proud Death, thy lifted spear,
Nor vaunt thee King of Terrors, here;
Shorn of thy first envenom'd sting,
Vain are all terrors thou canst bring:
Smite, monster, smite; nor spare thy deepest wound;
From Jesse's root our sovereign balm is found.

When o'er the world's wide misery,
Coeval darkness sway'd with thee,
Creation shrunk beneath thy frown,
And horror mark'd thy ebon crown,
Those downcast kingdoms, whelm'd in ruins lie,
Smote by the beaming day-spring from on high.

Tho' clad in vesture of affright,
Thou prowl'st beneath the pall of night,
Thy famish'd form doth quash alarm,
Unpoise that daring strengthless arm,
Bow thy diminish'd head &mdash; stern tyrant, flee,
For thou art swallow'd up in victory.

Sweet mercy hath her triumph shown,
Thy darken'd host of fear o'erthrown:
Now to behold thee &mdash; vanquish'd slave,
No power's left beyond the grave;&mdash;
We greet thee kind! &mdash; O wonderous friendship this!
Welcome, good herald! &mdash; to announce our bliss.
