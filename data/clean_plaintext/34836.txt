HICKEY, whose faithful Pencil Nature guides,
Attend the immortal Strains, sweet SPENSER sings,
Whilst on his fiery Pegasus he rides,
And steers his easy flight with rapid Wings.
Short is the Date of sublunary Things!
Not so, the genuine Joy, the Transport bright,
That from the Muses' sacred Fountain springs;
Perpetual Source of ever-new Delight.
In mad Ambition's Toils, let Fools unite;
Be thine, the pleasing Task, the fond Desire,
To trace fair Nature's Forms, to blend aright
The Painter's magick Skill, and Poet's Fire.
Congenial Studies mutual Aids impart,
"And Images reflect from Art to Art."
