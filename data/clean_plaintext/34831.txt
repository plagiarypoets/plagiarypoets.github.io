In a dark cave which never feels a ray
Of vivifying light from Phoebus' beam,
Where spiders weave their webs, and crickets play,
Or softly singing, like a virgin scream;
Trees which a century past full old did seem;
Elms, oaks, and firs in mournful order grow:
This we the cave of Melancholy deem!
Sweet Melancholy!  blessing unknown to few!
And Solitude enjoy'd beneath the withering yew.

A yellow paleness spreads all o'er her face,
Nor wanton art in mazes weave her hair;
A wither'd leaness, to the fair disgrace,
And tear-stain'd eyes, sad tokens of despair,
Are the indisputable marks she bear;
Pensive and slow with even steps she goes,
Giving a thought to every murd'ring care,
All noisy pomp, and worldly pride her foes,
And to the silent ruins vents she all her woes.

Oft by the lustre of the moon she walks
On the low bank of some pellucid fountain,
Or to herself in wild distraction talks,
At the firm basis of a lofty mountain,
Years, months, and weeks, and days she's always counting;
How long 'twill be before the body dead;
How long before her tow'ring sprits mounting,
Are to the summit of her wishes fled,
And all her yearings after Heaven are sped.

This, this is Melancholy, sober sage;
Thus dwells the soul on earth that's ever mourning;
Nought can, below, this fond desire assuage,
Which, tho' once conquer'd, ever is returning,
And with new ardor, for its absence, burning;
Is fed by silence, save the chearless noise
Of ravens, bats, and owls, who sweet repose are scorning.
She beats her heaving breast and sadly sighs,
Longs to hear heavenly trumpets sound, and then she dies.
