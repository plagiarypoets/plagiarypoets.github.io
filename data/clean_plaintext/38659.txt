Angels of Mercy, shield me with your wings
From yonder pest of Earth, whose poisonous breath
On Innocence her subtile venom flings,
And carries to the heart despair and death.

SUSPICION, fiend abhorred, hence!
I fly thy smooth pretence,
The changes of thy form,
To keep with ready art conceal'd
The mine of mischief unreveal'd;
And with cerulean beauty cloak the coming Storm.

I see thee sit with lustre meek
On tender Beauty's flushing cheek,
And, to my spirit-searching eyes,
Thy falt'ring latent pangs arise.
I mark thee slur the lovely pride
Of yonder timid, breathless BRIDE,
And, as she drops the apprehensive tear,
Sully its light with thy unholy leer.

Accursed Fiend!  thou with insidious art
Steal'st to the LOVER'S panting Heart,
And, whispering low the doubts that rend,
Doubts of the ever-trusted FRIEND,
The swelling, the indignant Soul
Confesses thy complete controul&mdash;
The clear Lymph curdles at the thought;
The Man is stung, his frame with Aspics fraught.
Sullen and dark, he, mutt'ring, glides along;
And searching to the Heart consummates all the wrong.

His FRIEND falls. &mdash; Lo, the pangs of Death
Choke his heavy, labouring breath;
He lives but maddening TRUTH to tell&mdash;
"I never wrong'd thee &mdash; now farewel!"
Lo, from yonder blasted bower
MADNESS flies, to prove his power:
He seizes on the burning BRAIN,
And turns to STEEL each trembling VEIN;
Wild flames the frenzy from his eyes,
And HORROR wraps him till he dies.

Hence, then, dire FIEND, hence to thy native Hell!
Nor ever dare with AUGHT I LOVE TO DWELL.
