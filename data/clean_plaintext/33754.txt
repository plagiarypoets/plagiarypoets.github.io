"Till old Experience do attain,
To something like prophetick Strain."
There let Time's creeping Winter shed,
His hoary Snow around my Head;
And while I feel by fast Degrees,
My Sluggard Blood wax chill, and freeze,
Let Thought unveil to my fixt Eye
The Scenes of deep Eternity,
Till Life dissolving at the View,
I wake, and find those Visions true.
