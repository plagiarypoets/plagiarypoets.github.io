But my desire and intent is that,
Your folly being in generall aimed at
Each one may take his share of shame and say,
In doing this I have not shewed fair play:
For what is either more or lesse set forth
'Gainst persons in particular; what worth
Or fame among the vulgar it may win
Without the Authors name, 't hath ever bin
Held as a Lybell both in Law and sence,
Then he who writes (what e're be his pretence)
His name should justifie what he hath done,
This maxim I have alwaies thought upon
Whatever yet was published by mee,
Was knowne by Martin Parker, or M. P.
All Poets (as adition to their fames)
Have by their Works eternized their names,
As Chaucer, Spencer, and that noble earle,
Of Surrie thought it the most precious pearle,
That dick'd his honour, to Subscribe to what
His high engenue ever amed at
Sydney and Shakspire, Drayton, Withers and
Renowned Jonson glory of our Land:
Deker, Learn'd Chapman, Haywood al thought good,
To have their names in publike understood,
And that sweet Seraph of our Nation, Quarles
(In spight of each planatick cur that snarles)
Subscribes to his Celestiall harmony,
While Angels chant his Dulcid melodie.
And honest John from the water to the land
Makes us all know an honour him by's hand;
And many more whose names I should have told
In their due place, in famous record inrould.
Have thought it honest honour to set downe
Their names or letters to what is their owne:
But you a litter of blind whelps begot
By Cerberus, the scumme of natur's pot,
Suborn'd by malice and a litle gaines,
Invent and publish what your frothy braines,
Envaporate some prose and some in rimes,
Onely to please the fancie of the time
Idle Chemeras, structures seeming faire,
Which vew'd, are prov'd meere castles in the aire.
Almanake Makers, were they of your minde,
(In stead of Saints to very day asign'd)
Might make a transmutation, and name all
By your quotidian Pamphlets criticall,
And dayes canicular should last all th' yeare,
If curish writers they may domineere;
The Presse is overprest, and (justly) grones
Under the burthen of those heavie tones
Of Scritch-oule musick, threatning death and hell,
One striving all in malice to excell. . . .
