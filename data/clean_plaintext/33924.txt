All things were hush'd, as noise itself were dead;
No mid-night Mice stirr'd round my silent Bed,
Not ev'n a Gnat disturb'd the Peace profound,
Dumb, o'er my Pillow hung my Watch unwound;
No ticking Death-Worm told a fancy'd Doom,
Nor hidden Cricket chirrupt in the Room;
No Breeze the Casement shook, or fann'd the Leaves,
Nor Drops of Rain fell soft from off the Eaves;
Nor noisy Splinter made the Candle weep,
But the dim Watch-light seem'd it self asleep,
When tir'd, I clos'd my Eyes &mdash; How long I lay
In Slumber wrapp'd, I list not now to say,
When hark, a sudden Noise!  see!  open flies
The yielding Door &mdash; I, starting, rubb'd my Eyes,
Fast clos'd awhile, and as their Lids I rear'd,
Full at my Feet a tall, thin Form appear'd.
While thro' my parted Curtains rushing broke
A Light like Day, e're yet the Figure spoke.
Cold Sweats bedew'd my Limbs &mdash; nor did I dream:
(Hear, Mortals, hear!  for real Truth's my Theme)
And now, more bold, I rais'd my Trembling Bones,
To look &mdash; when lo!  'twas honest Master JONES,
Who wav'd his Hand, to banish Fear and Sorrow,
Well charg'd with Toast and Sack, and cry'd Good Morrow.
