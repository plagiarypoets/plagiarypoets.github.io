Oh!  Chelsea dear!  let not the mournful voice
Of unknown song displease thee; rather lend
To hapless Edwin's strains
A willing, list'ning ear;
Yes, sober matron, fain would he repay
In part, the comforts which thy town affords;
And to thy daughters fair
Address the grateful lay;
For fair thy daughters are, and kind as fair,
And wise as kind, and generous as wise,
And sweet as generous,
And innocent as sweet.
Oft have they wing'd with bliss thine Edwin's hours,
When sad reflection else had whelm'd his thoughts,
And sorrow's sharpest fangs
Were fast'ning on his soul.
Yet, through the gentle converse of the fair
Prove thus consolatory, wanton fires
Ne'er flutter'd in his breast:
But friendship's hallow'd warmth,
Matur'd to chastest love, inspires each thought.
When he is wont to muse upon his fate,
He sighs; &mdash; to find that hope
Emits no cheering ray,
By which he may ascend to Hymen's fane;
Unless, inhuman thought!  his recreant mind
Consented to involve
A partner in his woes.
