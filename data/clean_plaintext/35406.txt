Ill fated tree! &mdash; Ah little did I ween
My frail and fading Life of longer date
Than thy firm Root, fair Stem and Branches sheen
That on the lingering sun beam smil'd so late!
Ah verse, &mdash; all powerless to postpone thy Fate.&mdash;
But in this Age Verse ill can intervene
Against Destruction's fang: &mdash; or ruthless War
The Realms of Verse and Arts ere this had ceas'd to tear.

Fallen art thou at once! &mdash; whom fiercest blast
Harm'd not, nor Winter's icy bolt could rive,
Man, more destructive than all storms, hath cast
To Earth! &mdash; for Ages thus dost thou survive?
Presumptuous Hope, that trusts aught here shall last!&mdash;
Not e'en a shatter'd Trunk where Bees might hive
Is left, where late thou didst so fair aspire;
Nor Branch, on which to hang the unavailing Lyre!

Nor Zephyr's breath, nor dew of vernal Heaven
Shall wake thee now; &mdash; whom, all up-rotted, tore
The cruel Axe! &mdash; to thee henceforth are even
"All seasons and their Change!" &mdash; Thee I deplore;
And in thy imag'd ruin muse on more
Which Man hath still to feel: &mdash; to Man is given
To see what wins the heart and charms the eyes,
Marks and adorns Life's Road, Death's unexpected Prize.
