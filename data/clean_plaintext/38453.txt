WILLIE.
Now het's the sun, to yon green hawthorn shade
Come let us gae; and while our flocks fu' glad
Feed on the gowan'd brae, let's try whilk best
Will raise the sang, or on my whistle, drest
Wi' nae sma' art, will play.  It was a gift
Frae Davie, luckless youth &mdash; Now I'm in tift,
On it to sound fu' sweet his humble name:
Wale wha ye like, that Shepherd is my theme.

JAMIE.
Wi' a' my heart; and Patie shall be mine,
Laith, laith I'd be his praises ere su'd tine.

WILLIE.
Nature's ain bairn the blooming Davie was;
The dew, ilk morn whilk on the gowan fa's,
Nae purer is; sae ae-faul'd was his mind,
Sae leal, sae saft, sae gen'rous, an sae kind.
Thae passions whilk sae aft deform the saul,
Were never kent his breast wi' rage to swell;
Nor poortith ay sae snell, nor sneer sae sour,
Cou'd e'er him dauntin, or his saul o'erpow'r:
He ay the same, ay on his brow was seen,
The smile o' peace, an' frae his lovely een
The luik o' friendship an' the luik o' love,
That spake his saul, an' ilka heart did move.

JAMIE.
O' a' the herds that gang o Fortha's banks,
Our blythsome Pate ay wi' the formaist ranks.
He is a callan that has sic a knack
O' gie'n delight: &mdash; His canty sang or crack
Flegs dool awa; gars e'en the heart sae cauld
Grow brisk; an' feckless eild its sell look bauld.
To his sweet pipe the lads and lasses skip,
An' e'en auld carlins aft times tak a trip.
When wi' their flocks, a' day, 'neath heat or cauld;
Or when at e'en they steek them in the fauld,
Sic are his paukie gates, that ane and a'
Think ilka thing is wrang when he's awa.

WILLIE.
While o the sunny hill his flocks did feed,
Early ilk morn young Davie tun'd his reed,
Or saftly sang o' love, or honour true;
Sae slaw and fast the melting music flew,
That sweetest Echo sent it round frae brae to brae.
But what o' ilk thing pleas'd him best of a',
Was the strange ferlies Nature ay did shaw:
For this the steepest craigs he aften speel'd,
Where the gleg eagle plants her lonely bield,
Or dander'd through the glen far out o' sight,
Or wood, or haugh, like a forsaken wight:
Or by the burn, or where the white faem jaws,
An' thuddin down frae crag to crag it fa's.
Aft did he like to hear the thunder rair,
And see the tempest shake the troubl'd air.
At een he ay was in the brawest tift,
On the hill-head to glow'r up to the lift,
To tent how moon and starns did blink or shine,
Or round their orbits row, or rin, or twine.

JAMIE.
Fair fa' my Pate, he's ay the canty chield:
At een when he comes frae the hill or field,
Baith young an' auld, they a' fu' cadgy luik.
When he begins the gudewife hads her wheel:
The lass wi' a cram'd gowpenfu' o meal
Stands still, an gawfs, till in the ingle's gane
The parritch broo; firing afore a stane
The bannock stands, an' burns as black's the cruick;
Ha'f in the taylor's needle sticks, &mdash; out frae a neuk
Thro' specks he glowrs, an' gapes his mou as wide
As hin ain sheers; an' now, frae ilke side,
The joke, the rair, the laugh, the canty sound
O' harmless wit an' glee gaes round an' round.
This is nae a', my Patie's heart is guide;
In a' his gates he's ay in sic a mood;
That takes wi' ilka ane; &mdash; to his lass leal;
He disna flit about like mony a chiel:
He downa bide nae mean or twafauld art,
He loes but ane; young Jenny hads his heart.

WILLIE.
My Davie's cot was ne'er the place o' din;
Twa three that kent his worth whiles dander'd in
To hear him crack, or read frae unco buiks.
Clean was their leaves, an' clear the bony hooks
That band them in; &mdash; they tald without a flaw
O' wars and battles, an' o' ilka law
Made for the common weal; o' ilka thing,
O' dowie winter, or the chearfu' spring,
On the wide warld, or in the starnie lift:
To ken tham a', was ay his utmaist drift,
An' chief delight. &mdash; Love too was his: &mdash; Its joys
He never fand.  Young Mary was his choice:
He lood oe'r weel to tell her out his mind:
Darn'd in his breast it lay; &mdash; the shepherd pin'd,
An' life, wi' a' its sweets, soon tint its gust:
The luckless youth sunk in the lonely dust.
She miss'd him frae the hill, or meadow green,
An' a' the gates he dander'd morn an' e'en.
She spier't the herds: &mdash; Thae pointed to his grave.
She didna speak; she didna greet nor rave.
She turn'd awa', an' wi' her gaed a train
O' waes, an' griefs, an' ay increasing pain.
'Twas but the tither day, I saw her lean,
Her lovely bosom on the wee grae stane
That marks his grave; &mdash; her face was wan an' pale;
Her lily hands she rais'd; the waefu' tale
Sat on her speechless tongue; &mdash; fair, fair, an' high
Her bosom heav'd; I heard the mournfu' sigh;
Saw in her een the tears of sorrow brust,
An' weet the turf that haps her Davie's dust.

JAMIE.
Ye've win the day; I needna farer gang;
Best ye hae sung, and best befar's your sang:
For what is wit compar'd wi' Davie's worth.
The best of fun's nought to that sterlin trouth,
That in his bosom dwalt, adorns his name,
An to the feeling muse gies ay a wordy theme.
