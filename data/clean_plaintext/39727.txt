Thy voice hath sank to silence &mdash; it hath pass'd
Even as a dream-hour!  but the tones thou'st flung
Around still sink and swell upon the blast&mdash;
Hark!  hear'st thou not the rigid critic's tongue
Declare thou hast been impotently strung?
Yea, I too feel I have but weakly striven
To rise from earth; but to the eagle's young,
In its first trembling flutter, is it given
To cleave the clouds and dare the fiery orb of heaven?

Has earth now an Alcmena's son, to crush,
Even in the cradle of his infant sleep,
The circling serpents, &mdash; in the silent hush
Of nameless haunts do not the streamlets creep,
'Ere, strong as death, they rock the thundering steep?
When morn comes upward from the mighty sea,
No beam of gladness gilds the billow's leap,
'Till more mature his reign of glory be&mdash;
Thus is it now, and thus it yet may be with thee!

Yet if not so, enough remains for me
To sit once more my leafy homes among,
To hold companionship with only thee,
And give my days to solitude and song!
And be the critic's censure weak or strong,
This is thy solace &mdash; thou hast wak'd no strain
Which Virtue may condemn!  Dost thou not long
For that which dwells not in the paths of men&mdash;
The voice of peace? &mdash; go, seek thy home of hills again!
