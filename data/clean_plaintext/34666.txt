Why are my tuneful hours traduc'd by spight?
The vein term'd trifling and the verses light?
Why will she say "While strenuous years support,
You shun th' allurements of the camp and court,
Disdain the babling bar's grave moots and saws,
And all the musty rolls of vulgar laws?"
In spheres like these let busy mortals shine,
A glorious immortality is mine.
Chaucer shall live, whilst Britain's sons are brave,
Whilst Britain's navy awes the subject wave:
Spencer endure while flocks enrich our fields,
Or yellow Ceres to the sickle yields.
Johnson will aye out last times cank'ring ails,
His genius fires not, yet his art prevails.
As nature's self immortal Shakespeare's name,
For he and nature always are the same.
The magic sounds of Dryden's breathing lyre,
Shall only in the gen'ral wreck expire.
While love shall last, and Cupid's bow is strung,
Thy well-clos'd verses, Waller, will be sung.
Angels shall con immortal Milton o'er,
When sun, and moon, and stars shall be no more.
Age after age Belinda's cheek shall glow,
And Eloisa's pensive sorrows flow;
By latest time be Lyttelton approv'd,
And with her Lyttelton be Lucy lov'd.
Kings shall give place to verse, their distance know,
And take their triumphs with them as they go;
To verse shall yield the source of fruitful Nile,
Let the vile vulgar gaze at things as vile,
To me let Phoebus from the sacred rill,
Of cool Castalia, flowing goblets fill;
Upon my brow the myrtle wreath I'll wear,
That shrinks impatient of too keen an air;
The verse shall flourish tho' the bard be dead,
Still by the anxious lover sought and read.
Spight spurns the living, spares the prostrate grave,
Where each his just reward of fame shall have.
Not all must perish with the fleeting breath,
A part will triumph over spight and death.
