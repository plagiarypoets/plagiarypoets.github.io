Say, did I dream?  for lo!  entranc'd I stood
And gazed upon a being not of earth;
No mortal form, no mortal features could
E'er give to such tumultuous feelings birth&mdash;
Feelings that were not sway'd by the surrounding mirth.

Her fairy steps was such as fancy tells,
None but inhabitants of that blest clime,
Where beauty, free from aught of blemish dwells&mdash;
Decayless lives &mdash; nor feels the hand of time,
Like when they sport amid the flow'ring groves of lime.

Her eye was far more dazzling than the beam
Reflected from the polish'd diamond's side,&mdash;
As pure, and splendid as the rays that gleam
In the broad Heaven, at glowing even-tide,
When Phoebus swift descends to greet his ocean bride.

The rose that blooms in Arab's spicy groves,
Cherish beneath an eastern maiden's care,
Or down, to rest upon the peach that loves,
Whose vermeil-colour would an Eve ensnare,
Might not with her soft cheeks, or ruby lips compare.

Her smiles &mdash; but ah!  impossible and vain,
That smile's delicious magic to express;
Language is too imperfect to explain
The mingled sense of fear, hope, joy, distress,
That when it beam'd on me, my bosom did confess.

Oh!  it was bland as April's gentlest sigh;
Mild as an orient gale wafting perfume;
It seem'd an Iris bright from worlds on high,
Sent down this earth so darksome to illume,
As if the pristine days their glories would resume.

And when she spoke, oh!  how those dulcet tones
Their thrilling power imparted to my soul,
Melodious more than nightingale that moans,
Or the gay lark soaring without control;
Or all the feather'd race "from Indus to the Pole."

Mute, motionless, as by enchantment bound,
Stood my unconscious, unobserving frame,
While my rapt ear devoured each seraph-sound
That from those virgin-lips harmonious came,
And Love within my breast, kindled his ardent flame.
