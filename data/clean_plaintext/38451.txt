Britons, no more your gen'rous Freedom boast,
Your in-born Virtue, and unbias'd Zeal;
With conscious Sorrow wail your Glories lost,
Your Laurels wither'd, and betray'd your Weal:
See, quick Destruction, with relentless Hand,
Hangs o'er the tott'ring State, and threatens all the Land.

In simple Nature's unaffected Mien,
By Custom blinded, we no Charms descry;
While apish Fancy fills the shifting Scene
With Noise, and Pertness, and stiff Foppery:
Vain costly Pomp and riotous Excess
Crowns ev'ry cloying Board, and fashions ev'ry Dress.

Think on the happy Times your Fathers saw,
(O never will those happy Times prevail?)
When Reason fram'd the necessary Law,
And rigid Justice poiz'd her equal Scale:
No fancy Faction fir'd the restless Crowd,
Nor Slaves to scepter'd Pow'r in base Submission bow'd.

Degenerate Sons!  in vain our honest Sires
In glorious Charter seal'd with patriot Blood;
In vain &mdash; while sordid Interest conspires
T' oppress the Virtuous and betray the Good;
While selfish Av'rice taints th' ignoble Soul,
And venal Knaves drink deep Corruption's venom'd Bowl.
