Grey mould'ring walls, relics of other days,
How Time hath laid her withering hand on thee,
As envious of thy greatness!  Thus she lays
The proud and mighty low; nor leaves to see
So much of what has been, to those who be;
Nor like the proud man in his fall, for thou
Hast still an honest friend left clingingly,
Bespeaking reverence for thy years, and now
An ivy garland wreathes thy venerable brow.

I stand where Wolsey stood, helpless and shorn
Of all his greatness &mdash; in his saddest hour&mdash;
His body bow'd down to the grave, though worn
Less with the lapse of years than loss of power:
For he had courted Fortune's highest dower,
And she had petted him; nor dream'd he then,
A face so cloth'd in smiles could ever lower&mdash;
That kings for sport do ever thus with men,
Raising them high, to hurl them down again.
