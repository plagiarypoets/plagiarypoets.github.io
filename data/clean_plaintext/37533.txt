I do not woo thy presence, INDOLENCE!
Goddess, I would not rank
A vot'ry in thy train.

I do not ask to wear thy fett'ring flowers,
O thou on whose cold lips
Faint plays the heartless smile!

Pale, sickly as the unkindly shaded fruit,
Thy languid cheek displays
No sunny hues of health;

There is no radiance in thy listless eye,
No active joy that fires
Its sudden glance with life.

I do not wish upon thy downy couch,
As in a conscious dream,
To doze away the hours,

But, to thy sister LEISURE I would pour
The supplicating prayer,
And woo her air benign:

Nymph, on whose sunny cheek, the hue of health
Blooms like the ruddy fruit
Matur'd by Southern rays;

Whose eye beam sparkles to the speaking heart,
Like the reflected noon
Quick glancing on the waves.

Her would I pray that not for ever thus
The ungentle voice of toil
Might claim my daily task.

So should my hand a votive temple rear,
Through many a distant age,
That undestroy'd should stand.

Long should the stately monument proclaim
That no ungrateful heart,
Goddess!  received thy boon.
