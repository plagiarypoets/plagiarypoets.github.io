But thou, enchantress-queen!  whose love hath made
His desolation &mdash; thou art by his side,
In all thy sovereignty of charms array'd,
To meet the storm with still unconquer'd pride.
Imperial being!  e'en though many a stain
Of error be upon thee, there is power
In thy commanding nature, which shall reign
O'er the stern genius of misfortune's hour;
And the dark beauty of thy troubled eye
E'en now is all illumined with wild sublimity.

Thine aspect, all impassion'd, wears a light
Inspiring and inspired &mdash; thy cheek a die,
Which rises not from joy, but yet is bright
With the deep glow of feverish energy,
Proud siren of the Nile!  thy glance is fraught
With an immortal fire &mdash; in every beam
It darts, there kindles some heroic thought,
But wild and awful as a sybil's dream;
For thou with death hast communed, to attain
Dread knowledge of the pangs that ransom from the chain.

And the stern courage by such musings lent
Daughter of Afric!  o'er thy beauties throws
The grandeur of a regal spirit, blent
With all the majesty of mighty woes!
While he, so fondly, fatally adored,
Thy fallen Roman, gazes on thee yet,
Till scarce the soul, that once exulting soar'd,
Can deem the day-star of its glory set;
Scarce his charm'd heat believes that power can be
In sovereign fate, o'er him, thus fondly loved by thee.
