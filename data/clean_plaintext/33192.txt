Anathema to irreligious mindes,
To black desarts;
Anathema to all prestigious signes,
And all false parts;
Anathema so all immodest lines;
Anathema Maranatha to harts,
Who to our youths corruption bend their Arts.

The faire white tower of gratious chastitie,
Mayds soveraigne praise,
And wives most duty, by what battery,
By what smooth wayes,
Is't not everted?  Muse the verses flye,
And flie the prose where such lewd baits doe lurke,
The poyson unwares doth ruine worke.

Better it were that Printers Art should dye,
Musicke bee dumb,
Better that impudence should dearely buy,
In fight to come,
And all the praise of wit in dust should lye,
English take rust, and Britaine barbarous bee,
Rather then shamelesse.  Heaven loves chastitee.

Greece had her Sappho, and her spruce old wagg,
Anacreon,
Rome her Catullus, and the like some bragg,
Of Albion.
And would to God that heerein to seeme lagg,
Were not a cause of absurd shame to many,
Court who court list, bee not wits Ape to any.

Without that noble Sidney heere I tax,
Or Spencers pomp:
And gladly granting Johnson nothing lacks
Of Phoebus stamp.
For never wits were made of finer wax,
Then England hath to vaunt of in these times,
But them I tax whose reason's lost in rimes.

Despaire of such as in some bookes delight,
That shall bee namelesse,
Fathers keep children from contagious sight
Of authors shamelesse,
For they are charmes, and nature soften quite:
And such as use them will too soone finde true,
That they are blest who such bookes never knew.

Anathemaes of other kindes to reare,
Joyes God and Man;
Anathema another sense may beare,
As sacred can;
Sacred for hallowed, and the same for dire.
New HELICON for new JERUSALEM,
Mine HELICON an holy ANATHEM.
