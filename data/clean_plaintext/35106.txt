"Accept, dear Phil, this rude, unskilful verse,
Tho' nor by Muse inspir'd, nor Grace refin'd,
Which I, in loose alternate rhime rehearse,
To soothe the sorrows of thy gentle mind.

"What, tho' no polish'd lines, like Pope's, appear,
No boldly-splendid thoughts my theme refine,
&mdash;Such as in Spenser's nobler page appear,
Or Collins, in thy strains majestic shine?

"I court not now the laurel'd wreath of Fame,
Or various praise of nervous, smooth, and clear.
Enough my honour, all I wish and claim,
If with my verse thy bosom I may cheer.

"Fair Friendship's voice shall breathe in ev'ry line
The faithful dictates of an honest heart:
Friendship alone inspir'd the fair design
To thee, these soothing verses to impart.

"No need is there of lofty Spenser's fire;
No need of tuneful Pope's energic art,
To strike, with trembling hand, a humble lyre,
And sing the genuine feelings of the heart.

"But if my numbers should offend thy ear,
Oh think they flow from an uneasy heart:
The voice of Anguish never can be clear,
And Melancholy mars the tuneful art.
