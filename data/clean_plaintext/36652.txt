Behold the orchards bearing golden stores,
The barns replenished with the ripened grain,
Whilst e'en from wood, heath, hedge-row Nature pours
Her bounties forth against the gelid reign
Of gloomy Winter stints the ferine train;
Yet ripe with riches though the Autumn be,
Does it the promise of the Spring maintain?
When teem'd with bud and blossom every tree,
And all was beauty and expectancy;
So &mdash; when success attends on human schemes,
Crowning man's autumn season, could we see,
The fairy objects of his youthful dreams,
Comparing plan and structure; how should we
Perceive Hope's visions mock reality!
