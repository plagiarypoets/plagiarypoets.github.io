Here rest their Heads in Power's and Honour's grave,
A band to Fortune and to Fame unknown
Fair Science never smil'd on their conclave,
And Scorn and Weakness mark'd them for their own.

Large were their means, yet constant their defeat,
And France, deriding, mock'd their wild intentions;
They gave to England, all they could &mdash; a debt;
They gain'd from England, all they wish'd &mdash; their Pensions.

Seek not (vain hope) their merits to disclose,
Nor paint their faults to sadden their condition
These let them try with trembling hope t' expose,
And those defend &mdash; on bench of Opposition.
