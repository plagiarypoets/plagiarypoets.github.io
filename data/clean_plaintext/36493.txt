With a warm heart o'erthronged with many a fear,
In childhood I beheld this lonely pile
Stirring poetic thoughts &mdash; from year to year
It caught the evening moon's pale silver smile,
And seemed enthroned in mystery; the while
The ascetic owl poured forth his sullen shriek,
And from its crannied base or chappelled aisle
Forth darted the dim bat, with vision weak,
Skimming along the wave which at its foot did break.

And close upon the skirt of eve there came
The fisher's skiff, with soal or turbot fraught,
Cleaving the wave crested with phosphor flame,
Which, leaning o'er the prow, his urchin caught
In unburnt hand &mdash; the sire, with riper thought,
Eying the pole-star or the glittering wain,
Or, in his rude mythology, the grot
Beneath the turret, peopling with the train
Of fairy elves who haunt the margin of the main.

Just then the visions of far Araby
Had spread their fibres round my fancy's spring,
And struck deep root; and forth I stole to be
Free to indulge my fond imagining:
The oar's light dip &mdash; the rustling vulture's wing
Brushing the ivy'd tower &mdash; the far-off sail
Glancing athwart the moonlight, &mdash; failed to bring
Other than magic tropes, without the pale
Of whatsoe'er of true in nature doth prevail.

Genii, magicians, filled the moaning wind
That came at fits thro' the ruined wall,
Which seemed an isthmus reared up by the mind,
To part the unreal from the natural:
And if a lapse of sound, perchance let fall
In the dusk woods behind, at eve were heard,
Strait 'twas the spirit of the breeze's call
Mustering his brethren, and his very word
Noted, distinct became, as song of well-known bird.

But time subdues romance: &mdash; by slow degrees,
Like the bright tincture of an evening cloud
Through which the light is lapsing, on the breeze
Floated the fairies off &mdash; the genii bowed
Their heads, and, shuffling on their midnight shroud,
Escaped into the darkness. &mdash; All alone,
At early manhood's dawn, I stood, not proud
That these my boyhood's visitants were gone,
But choosing Truth's stern lap to lay my head upon.
