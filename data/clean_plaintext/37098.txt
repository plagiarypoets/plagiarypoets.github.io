But see, as one awak'd from deadly trance,
With hollow and dim eyes, and stony stare,
Captivity with faltering step advance!
Dripping and knotted was her coal black hair:
For she had long been hid as in a grave;
No sound the silence of her prison broke,
Nor one companion had she in her cave,
Save Terror's dismal shape, that no word spoke,
But to a stony coffin on the floor
With lean and hideous finger pointed evermore.
