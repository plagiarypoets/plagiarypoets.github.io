Mirth and nuptiall joyes betide
Th' happy Bridegrome and fair Bride,
Sol have quencht his glowing beame
In the coole Atlantick streame,
Now their shines no tell-tale sun
Hymens rites are to be done,
Now Loves revells 'gin to keepe,
What have you to doe with sleepe?
You have sweeter sweets to prove,
Lovely Venus wakes, and love,
Goddesse of Nocturnall sport
Alwaies keep thy jocond court
In this loving couples armes
(O that my praiers might prove charmes.)
Goddesse of the marriage feast
Here approach at our request
Saturnia, whose car I saw
A harnest teame of Peacoks draw
Fercely through the fleeting skie,
Wherein sate thy majestie,
On thee did an Hoast attend
Of bright goddesses, descend
From that chariot, and blesse
Julia's womb with fruitfulnesse,
Make her, when 9 Moneths be run
Mother of a lovely son,
Let every yeer the Queene of love
Her new fill'd cradle rock, and move.
Mirth and Nuptiall joyes betide
The happy Bridegroome, and fair Bride.
