Harp of the West, that long had lain unwept,
All desolate, by Tara's ruin'd wall,
While the cold night-dews o'er thy silence wept,
And sorrowed at thy melancholy thrall;
Thy bondage could not move one heart of all
Thy fetter'd, spirit-broken, sons to pour
From thy sad chords one note, since Freedom's fall,
'Till, starting into life, from shore to shore,
Thy witching numbers own'd the inspiring touch of MOORE.

O, with what ecstasy my bosom thrill'd,
When lonely wandering by the placid sea,
The else unbroken moonlight calm was fill'd
With breathings of thy magic minstrelsy;
Not such as echoed in thy noontide glee,
'Mid festive boards, or burn'd o'er battle plains&mdash;
Nor such, indeed, as when thy sons were free,
But sweet and plaintive were those moonlight strains
That poured the "Song of Sorrow" o'er thy Country's chains!

Bard of the West!  of Erin's weeping land!
Tho' rough and rude the stripling strains that swell
To gratulate thee on that native strand,
Which thou hast sung, and lovest yet so well;
Still do "I feel the bliss I do not tell,"
When I behold the Patriot in whose songs
The name of Erin shall undying dwell&mdash;
That Bard to whom th' exclusive task belongs,
To exalt his Country's pride, and soothe his Country's wrongs!
