Phoebus vouchsafe thy sacred Muse to lend
Pieria dames, your solemne tunes applie,
Aid sisters nine with me your deitie,
That to your seates these sacred notes may bend,
That you with me, and I with you may praise,
Elizas name and blisfull happie daies.

A Nymph more charie farre to gods than men,
Of gods belov'd.  O happy we that knowe,
O blisful soile where blossoms such do growe,
Unkindest earth that should not love hir then,
Unworthie much of hir that lov'd thee stil,
Whose love the gods accept with better wil.

People unkinde, but these that vertues prize,
You kinde by love do knowe what joy it is
To dwel on soile where peace yeeldes setled blis,
Unkind the rest too much that doe devize
To rue the soile, the seat, the state and al,
Of hir, for hirs that lives, and ever shal.

O Nature, wert thou now as firme on earth,
By equal mixture with the heavenly powers,
That in the soile where grewe such princely flowers,
The bravest blossome sprung by stately birth:
Now living stil might ever live on mould,
And never fade (O gods) that you so would.

Virtue be dombe, and never speake of grace,
And gracious Nymphs, that Virtues handmaides be,
Shrowde al at once your sweet eternitee:
Be Vertue now no more, nor in your space
Let grace be set without in large account,
O sacred Queene, thou others doost surmount.

Peace be thy nurse to feede thy happy yeares,
And endles Fame whereon thy throne is set,
To sound thy praise my Muse shal never let:
Live long, and raigne in joy among thy peeres,
Deare to the gods, to vertue, to thy soile,
Kept by thy grace from pray of forren spoile.
