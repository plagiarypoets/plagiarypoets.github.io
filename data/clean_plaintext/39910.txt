Oh, it is sweet at twilight hour to view
While sinks the Sun beneath the western sky,
The bright clouds sailing through a sea of blue,
Attired in robes of gorgeous majesty;
And, as along the vaulted canopy,
With Sol's last ling'ring crimson rays they beam,
Like airy sprites in graceful curves they fly,
And wild and fanciful as forms that seem
To glide around our couch in fitful feverish dream.

And now a beauteous landscape strikes mine eyes,
Where Nature glows in loveliest, richest pride,
And lofty towers, and palaces arise,
With gardens gay, and flowing streams beside,
Methinks, seraphic forms appear to glide,
In snow white robes, amid yon bowers remote!
Methinks, upon the zephyrs gentle tide,
I hear the lute's low breathing softly float,
Like the Eolian harp's slow rising swelling note!

But oh ye fairy visions of delight,
E'en while I gaze, spell bound by Fancy's power,
How fast ye vanish from my raptur'd sight
Like joy's delusive, evanescent hour!
And every mimic scene, and glittering bower,
Melts quick away like wreath of mountain snow,
And brilliant palaces and gilded tower,
Fainter and fainter in the sun-beam glow,
Till Night her sable mantle over all doth throw.

Thus do we ever see the fairest forms,
Blighted the soonest by Death's ruthless sway;
And thus the brightest minds that Genius warms,
Before Misfortune's chilling blast decay&mdash;
Thus Youth's enchanting prospects fade away;
Thus riper Manhood's warmest hopes deceive;
Thus years of gloom do sunny hours outweigh,
And thus while o'er departed joys we grieve,
Life swiftly flits away like cloud on Summer's eve.
