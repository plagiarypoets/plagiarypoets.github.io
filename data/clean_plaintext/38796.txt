As gallant DUNCAN and his squadron ride
In Yarmouth waves, the welcome tidings greet
His raptur'd ears, that on the foaming tide
At length appear Batavia's hostile fleet:
Forthwith his sailors loose the spacious sail,
And give, with joyful shouts, its bosom to the gale.

Now on the main his mighty castles roll,
And soon advance Batavia's ships in sight:
Unbounded transport fills his veteran soul,
He burns with ardour to begin the fight;
His fearless seamen, to their country true,
Like angry lions pant to meet the foes in view!

At once, undaunted, through their yielding line
Immortal DUNCAN makes his dreadful way,
Expiring groans and uproar huge combine
T' increase the horrors of the bloody fray;
Like trembling XERXES, hosts of Dutchmen stand,
And view, with anxious hearts, the conflict from the land!

Nor of DE WINTER, of no vulgar fame,
The humble Muse withholds her share of praise:
So brave a warrior and so great a name
Demand, at least, a portion of her lays,
Pleas'd, she proclaims that generous Britons know
How great the pleasure is to laud a valiant foe!

Long time DE WINTER, on his blood-stain'd deck
With dauntless courage, bids his cannons roar,
Nor cease their thunders 'till his ship a wreck
Is made, and strew'd with horrid carnage o'er;
Then adverse fate compels him to resign
Himself, and nine large tow'rs &mdash; the noblest of his line!

Oh, may BRITANNIA of the ocean reign
Alone the Queen, 'till time shall be no more!
May no cabals her list of glories stain,
Nor banish peace and commerce from her shore:
But ever ready may her thunder be
To lay the tyrant low &mdash; and set th' oppressed free!
