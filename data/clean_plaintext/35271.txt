One day I wrote her name upon the strand,
But came the waves and washed it away:
Againe, I wrote it with a second hand,
But came the tyde, and made my paines his pray.
Vaine man, said she, that doost in vaine assay,
A mortal thing so to immortalize,
For I myselfe shall like to this decay,
And eke my name be wiped out likewise.
Not so, quoth I, let baser things devise
To die in dust, but you shall live by fame:
My verse your virtues rare shall eternize,
And in the heavens write your glorious name.
Where, when as death shall all the world subdew,
Our love shall live, and later life renew.
