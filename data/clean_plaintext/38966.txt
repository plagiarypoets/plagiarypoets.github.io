Old Ocean hath not brought his terrors here,
But the pleased eye rests on a beauteous plain,
Smooth as the sand, and as the heaven clear,
Whose rippling margin whispers in such strain,
That scarce the eager footsteps can refrain
From venturing on to where those fairy Heights appear!

Dim, but not dark, they shadowy brightness send
Across the distance; then they melt in air;
Then, bursting from a cloud, they seem to bend
Nearer to France, and sterner port they bear;
And then the Sun's rich livery they wear,
As if his Viceroy's, charg'd his glories to extend.

Are they the portals of some bless'd abode,
Sunk in the waters, rising to the skies?
Or mounds for the cherubic guard who showed
Their flaming weapons over Paradise?
Or outworks of Eternity, that rise
Unchang'd, though years have passed, storms howled, and currents flow'd!

Sure Time on them hath built his royal throne,
Displayed his state, and fixed his Majesty;
From whence to view all by his hand cast down,
City, and realm, order, and dynasty,
Go floating, on the stream of ages, by
In fragments, soon to sink, then rest for aye unknown.

And to his feet he hath the Tempests ta'en,
And kennell'd them in caves from whence they cry,
Until he lets them loose upon the Main,
Which bellows through its lone immensity,
As o'er its breast they in their fury fly,
Howling a many-voiced hymn of wild disdain!

Loud be their roar, and tameless be their rage!
For there is one to whom their wrath is might;
Yoked to her car, they've sped, for many an age,
Her vengeance on its course, in glorious fight&mdash;
Then turn'd to crouch around her, like the Night,
Still ready for the Island Queen new wars to wage.
