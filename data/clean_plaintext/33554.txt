O Muse, what dost thou whisper in my eare?
What thou suggests to me I dare not heare,
Find thee an abler Agent, alas I
Am all unfit for Warlike Poesie,
To sing the Acts of Heros, and compile
The Deeds of Kings, in a full heightned stile,
Is such a task I dare not undergoe,
How to begin, or end, I do not know:
And more, if Spencer could not scape the spite
Of tongues malevolent, whose gentle sprite
Prompted him, so meek as never man
Before him could, nor (I think) ever can,
I then shall (sure) be bitt to death, but yet
If thou commandest that I forward set,
I will not be rebellious, but desire,
Thoult warme my bosome with thy hottest fire.
