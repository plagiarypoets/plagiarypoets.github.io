Full vainlie is the swete Sprynge 'dyght,
And pranckt in every parte,
Syth manne ne tastes the trewe delyght,
Withouten peace of harte.

The vernalle bloosme, the vernalle thoughte,
These give the Sprynge to raigne;
'Tis owers &mdash; for Zephyre home hath broughte
Ower LIEFEST LIEGE agayne!

From Neptune's lowde triomphes he sped,
The feare of faithless Gaull,
With thousande blessings heried,
And Heven approving all.

To HIS owne Paradise HE came,
The Pan look'd up and smylde,
One arme susteyned HIS peerless Dame,
And one THEIR cherub Chylde.

From THEM we coppie Vertue's mein,
Reflect Love's forme and feature,
Attune ower bosomes to the scene,
And harmonyse with Nature.

At THEIR approche the glad Rosiere,
A fresher fragraunce takes;
And, heark!  the little feather'd quiere,
His merriest musique makes.

And couldst thou Patriote false and foule,
Brooke a right Patriote Kynge?
The venime voyded from thy soule,
E'en thou mayst taste the Sprynge.

Poor Martyre of thine owne envye!
Why blaste the bloosmynge yere?
Let but thy causeless clamours dye,
Aeternalle Sprynge is here!
