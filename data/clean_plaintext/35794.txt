Sweet Cherwell, from thy crystal tide
What note of sorrow meets my ear,
While nature laughs in summer's pride,
And flings her choicest treasures here!

Though neighbouring Isis proudly swell
By holy towers and forests fair,
Though round her banks the muses dwell,
And bathe their silver tresses there,

Thy groves and milder shades beneath
Full oft would Warton lie reclin'd,
And hear thy waving willows breathe
So deeply to the passing wind.

And here as oft the star of eve
Beam'd sweetly in the western sky,
His rapid fancy lov'd to weave
Some tale of Gothic minstrelsy.

Then Cherwell flow in native pride
Thy vales and secret shades among,
Nor envy once thy Sister tide,
Her flow'ry banks, her Naiad throng.

That bard that here so oft before,
Of fancy's dreams would take his fill,
In death shall haunt this silver shore,
And love thy whispering waters still.
