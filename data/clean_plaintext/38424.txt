Another wreath, her conquering prow
Has won, to great BRITANNIA'S brow,
Where th' Atlantic's billowy roar
Assails her sister's western shore!
Predictive of her Navy's fall,
Another Triumph humbled Gaul
Shall trembling hear; and, once again,
Confess the Queen of Isles resistless on the main!

The long Levant, from Calpe's rock
To high Canopus, felt the shock,
That lately whelm'd her eastern pride
Beneath the Nile's sea-mingled tide;
Resounding thence, with light'ning's speed,
Victorious NELSON'S mighty deed,
O'er swarthy Afric's burning sands,
To Asia's gem-producing strands;
While wond'ring Europe own'd his vast renown,
Unmatch'd in ancient times &mdash; unequall'd in our own.

Yet, scarcely had this Naval Sun
His brilliant race of glory run,
When lo!  another mounts in sight,
Dispensing wide its cheerful light!
See WARREN rise, and o'er the wat'ry way
Effuse his emulative ray;
Dispersing quick the gloom profound,
That mournful ERIN compass'd round;
And rescuing thus her fertile shore
From dire Disorder's woes, and Gaul's dread grasp, once more.

Bless, bounteous isle!  the happy day
That bound thee first to Britain's fate;
Ne'er with ingratitude repay
Her kindness, nor her love with hate:
But give h er thy regard sincere,
Thy whole, thy undivided heart,
Who thus destroys each secret snare,
Each open effort of Ambition's art
To wrest the sceptre from her fost'ring hand,
And with the scourge of war afflict thy favour'd land.
