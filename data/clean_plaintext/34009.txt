When welcome rain the weary reapers drove
Beneath the shelter of a neighbouring grove;
Robin a love-sick swain lagg'd far behind,
Nor seem'd the weight of falling showers to mind;
A distant solitary shade he sought,
And thus disclos'd the troubles of his thought.

Ay, ay, thur drops may cuil my out-side heat;
Thur callar blasts may wear the boilen sweat:
But my het bluid, my heart aw'in a bruil,
Nor callar blasts can wear, nor drops can cuil.

Here, here it was (a wae light on the pleace)
At first I gat a gliff o' Betty's feace:
Blyth on this trod the smurker trip'd and theer
At the deail-head unluckily we shear:
Heedless I glim'd, nor cou'd my een command,
Till gash the sickie went into my hand:
Down hell'd the bluid; the shearers aw brast out
In sweels of laughter; Betty luik'd about;
Reed grew my fingers, reeder far my feace:
What cou'd I de in seck a dispert kease?

Away I sleeng'd, to Grandy meade my mean
My Grandy (God be wud her, now she's geane)
Skilfu' the gushen bluid wi' cockwebs staid;
Then on the sair an healen plaister laid;
The healen plaister eas'd the painfull sair,
The arr indeed remains, but naething mair.

Not sae that other wound, that in ward smart,
My Grandy cou'd not cure a bleedin heart;
I've bworn the bitter torment three lang year,
And aw my life-time mun be fworc'd to bear,
'Less Betty will a kind physician pruive;
For nin but she has skill to medcin luive.

But how shou'd honest Betty give relief?
Betty's a perfet stranger to my grief:
Oft I've resolved my ailment to explain;
Oft I've resolved indeed &mdash; but all in vain:
A springin blush spred fast owr aither cheek,
Down Robin luiked and deuce a word cou'd speak.

Can I forget that night!  (I never can)
When on the clean sweeped hearth the spinnels ran.
The lasses drew their line wi' busy speed;
The lads as busy minded every thread.
When, sad!  the line sae slender Betty drew,
Snap went the thread and down the spinnel flew:
To me it meade &mdash; the lads began to glop&mdash;
What cou'd I de?  I mud, mud take it up;
I tuik it up and (what gangs pleaguy hard)
Een reached it back without the sweet reward.

O lastin stain!  even yet it's eith to treace
A guilty conscience in my blushen feace:
I fain wou'd wesh it out but never can;
Still fair it bides like bluid of sackless man.

Nought sae was Wully bashfu' &mdash; Wully spyd
A pair of scissars at the lass's side;
Thar lowsed, he sleely droped the spinnel down&mdash;
And what said Betty? &mdash; Betty struive to frown;
Up flew her hand to souse the cowren lad,
Butah, I thought it fell not down owr sad:
What follow'd I think mickle to repeat,
My teeth aw' watterd then, and watter yet.

Een weel is he 'at ever he was bworn!
He's free frae aw this bitterment and scworn:
What mun I still be fashed wi' straglen-sheep,
Wi' far-fetched sighs, and things I said a-sleep;
Still shamefully left snafflen by my sell
And still still dog'd wi' the damn'd neame o'mell?

Whare's now the pith (this luive!  the deuce ga' wi't!)
The pith I showd when eer we struive, to beat;
When a lang lwonin through the cworn I meade,
And bustlin far behind the leave survey'd.

Dear heart!  that pith is geane and comes nae mair
'Till Betty's kindness sall the loss repair;
And she's not like (how sud she?) to be kind,
Till I have freely spoken out my mind,
Till I have learnd to feace the maiden clean,
Oiled my slow tongue, and edged my sheepish een.

A buik theer is &mdash; a buik &mdash; the neame-shem faw't:
Some thing o'compliments I think they caw't:
'At meakes a clownish lad a clever spark,
O hed I this!  this buik wa'd de my wark;
And I's resolved to hav'et what ever't cost:
My flute &mdash; for what's my flute if Betty's lost?
And if sae bony a lass but be my bride,
I need not any comfort lait beside.

Farewell my flute then yet or Carlile fair;
When to the stationers I'll stright repair,
And bauldly for thur compliments enquear;
Care I a fardin, let the prentice jeer.

That duine &mdash; a handsome letter I'll indite,
Handsome as ever country lad did write;
A letter 'at sall tell her aw' I feel,
And aw my wants without a blush reveal.

But now the cloudsbrek off and sine ways run;
Out frae his shelter lively luiks the sun,
Brave hearty blasts the droopin barley dry,
The lads are gawn to shear &mdash; and sae mun I.
