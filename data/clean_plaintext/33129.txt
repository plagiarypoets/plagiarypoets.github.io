A Poets borne, not made:  No wonder then
Though Spencer, Sidney:  (miracles of men,
Sole English Makers; whose ev'n names so hie
Express by implication Poesy)
Were long unparaleld:  For nature bold
In their creation, spent that precious mould,
That Nobly better earth, that purer spirit
Which Poets, as their Birth-rights, claime t' inherite:
And in their great production, Prodigall;
Carelesse of futures well-nye spent her all
Viewing her work:  conscious sh' had suffred wracke
Hath caus'd our Countrymen eer since to lacke
That better earth, had forme:  Long thrifty growne
Who truely might beare Poets, brought forth none:
Till now of late, seeing her stockes new-full
(By Time, and Thrift) of matter beautifull,
And quint-essence of formes; what severall
Our elder Poets graces had, those all
Shee now determin'd to unite in one;
So to surpasse her selfe; and call'd him Browne.
That beggard by his birth, shee's now so poore
That of true Makers shee can make no more.
Hereof accus'd; answer'd, shee meant that hee
A species should, no individuum bee.
That (Phoenix-like) Hee in himselfe should find
Of Poesy contain'd each severall kind.
And from this Phoenix's urne, thought shee could take
Whereof all following-Poets well to make.
For of some forme, shee had, now made knowne
They were her errours whilst sh' intented Browne.

In libellum inscriptionemq;

Not Aeglogues your, but Eclogues:  To compare:
Virgil's selected, yours elected are.
He Imitates, you Make:  and this your creature
Expresseth well your Name, and theirs, their Nature.
