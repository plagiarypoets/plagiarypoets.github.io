Celestial Harp!  that once in Salem shed
The balm of bliss on spirits steep'd in wo,
Whose powerful tones, Despair's dark dells to glad,
Shall yet o'er every land melifluous flow;
Accross thy strings, advent'rous, who can throw
His daring hand, nor ask with anxious pain,
If in his breast these holy fervours glow,
Accordant with thy heart-reviving strain,
Lest haply thy bold swell he damp with touch profane?
