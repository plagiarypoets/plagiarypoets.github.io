Spirit of elder Time!  immortal Song!&mdash;
The high and the inspired have told thy worth;
Thou shed'st around us, like the night's bright throng,
A ray of softness, gracefulness, and mirth:
Thou art, and hast been, from thine earliest birth,
A charm with Man's affections intertwined:&mdash;
A beauty and glory upon earth:&mdash;
A power and a creation of the mind,
Which is itself divine &mdash; mysterious &mdash; undefined!

With the young minstrel, in his visioned moods,
Thou art a "visible presence;" &mdash; thy decree
Throngs with majestic forms his solitudes,
His feelings &mdash; thoughts &mdash; receive their life from thee:
Spirit of Song!  the melancholy sea
Gives up its ancient secrets to thy hand;&mdash;
Thou speak'st the language of eternity:
Histories of long-lost years at thy command
Sound on the thousand tongues and echoes of the land!

Thou sing'st the sweetness of the morn's first  hour,
When to the founts her loveliest tints are given;
Thou sing'st of love &mdash; in court, in hall, or bower;
Of those who with hard fate have nobly striven;
Thou sing'st of war &mdash; of helms and corslets riven,
Of the dread grandeur of the battle-field;
Where flees the foe, by horse and horseman driven,
Flash the sharp brands the victors madly wield,
Red in the blood of all &mdash; that strive or basely yield.

Spirit of Verse!  in deepest reverence
I bow before thine ever glorious shrine;
Thee I have loved with passion most intense;
And though I feel thy meeds can ne'er be mine,
Yet may I pour one low and gentle line,
A breath of song:  I know it to be vain,
This cherished wish, a living wreath to twine;
'Tis not for me such honour to attain&mdash;
Some few may list, perhaps, and not condemn my strain.
