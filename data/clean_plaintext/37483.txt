Hence!  to thy dark abode again,
Faction, foulest fiend of men,
What ghastly furies mark'd thy hated birth;
Madness, Revenge, and fell Despair,
Gloomy discontent was there:
"Be this imp," they cried, "to scourge the subject earth."

Known by thy frenzy-rolling eye,
Link'd with the arch fiend Blasphemy,
Known by the maniac crew that throng thy side:
Before thee rush the dogs of War,
Rapine stalks behind thy car,
And Desolation spreads her ruin wide.

Yet oft, each horrid yell between,
The placid eye, the look serene,
Essays to catch the young unwary breast;
The purpose dark, th' infectious guile,
Crouch'd beneath the specious smile,
And lo!  the dagger's point beneath thy blood-stain'd vest.

Deaf to the sound of human woe,
Thy frozen tears forget to flow;
Deaf to the widow's plaint the orphan's cry,
What!  tho' flames around thee rise,
With a savage joy they glut their eyes,
Nor like a hero dost thou heave one sigh.

Yet 'mid these horrid scenes of blood,
Tho' wallowing in the purple flood,
Corruption oft hath ply'd her wily art;
And when ceas'd the battle's roar,
And Delusion's charm was o'er,
How hast thou gnaw'd thyself, and torn thy own vile heart.

Hence, join thy Gallia's panting throng,
That raise the democratic song,
Waving their red caps, badge of Liberty.
Go!  ne'er desert their glorious cause;
For thee, they burst all Nature's laws,
For thee &mdash; degen'rate race, insulted majesty.

Yes!  we have watch'd thee hov'ring o'er,
Britain's sea-encircled shore,
And brooding once upon the main below:
But know, th' undaunted lion's power
Collected stands in danger's hour,
Prepar'd to spring upon his secret foe.

Know that her tutelary god
Vindictive stands, with iron rod,
And bares his right red-arm on fiends like thee,
And holds Religion's golden shield,
To which each pow'r appall'd must yield,
To save from thy dread grasp, the isle of Liberty.
