A Virgin Princesse and a gentle Lambe,
Domb'e both to death to gorge this ugly beast:
This valiant victor like a Souldier came,
And of his owne accord, without request:
With never daunted spirit the Fiend assaild,
Preserv'd the Princesse, and the Monster quaild.

Saint George the figure of our Saviours force,
Within the Dragons Jawes his speare hath entred:
Whose Sword doth threaten banishing remorce,
And hee that on his noble hart hath ventred,
Spewes foorth his poison on the sullen ground,
And stands in danger of a deadly wound.

And may my soule, Oh Jesus, speake with zeale,
Thy word, thy sword, will Sathans pride consume:
So doth thy fathers holy love reveale,
And with that beast, all those that dare presume:
That peece of wood whereon thy body died,
Hath made a mortall passage in his side.

Saint George the Dragon, Jesus Sathan kild,
Saint George the Princesse and the Lambe preserv'd:
Jesus his bitter combat hath fulfild,
And by the Divels death his Church reserv'd:
That spotlesse Dame whose ravishment was sought,
By tirants rage that bloody ruine brought.

Saint Georges Knight renowmed Mountjoy one,
Bearing thy Saviours badge within thy breast:
Quell that Hells shape of divelish proud Terone,
And cover with the dust his stubborne Crest:
That our deere Princesse and her land bee safe,
Such power to him, Oh Jesus Christ vouchsafe.
