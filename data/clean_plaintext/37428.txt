I.
Sonorous DAUGHTER of the BOX!
On this high Poplar hang, my LYRE,
While Heaven thus smiles, and Vernal Airs
Play, wanton, with the Leaves.

II.
Thy trembling Strings a whispering Breeze
Soft shall attune; while I, beneath,
On this green Bank supinely lie,
Thus carelessly diffus'd!

III.
The rilling Brook, that murmurs by,
Shall lull my Thoughts, till gentle Sleep
Seize Me; with pleasing Golden Dreams
Of my CECILIA blest!

IV.
But ah! &mdash; What sudden Clouds Above
Fly shadowing!  How dark the Air!
What Sound of clattering Hail I hear?
Rise, luckless DAMON, Rise.

How soon, alas!  thy Joys decay!
How swift all Pleasures haste away!
