Ah, books belov'd!  ah, pleasing shop!
So form'd to entertain;
Where one so easily may pop
His nose in time of rain.
I feel th' immortal Three-times Three
Inspire, whene'er I think of thee;
As down I set of thee to write,
My grey goose quill they seem to warm,
And, redolent of rapture, charm
Away my senses quite,

Say C&mdash;, for thou hast seen
Full many a critic race,
With learned phiz, thy walls within,
The paths of knowledge trace;
Who foremost now, with sapient looks,
Delight to rummage 'mong thy books?
Who into disputations fall?
What idle progeny succeed,
To sit the live-long day and read,
And still find fault with all?

Whilst some, on information bent,
Their deep researches ply,
And, on the tomes of old, intent
Still pore with curious eye;
Some, more advent'rous, seize the pen,
And strain each nerve, and rack their brain,
And dare themselves, to gain a name;
Still as they write, they hither hie,
To gain of strength a new supply,
And snatch a dubious fame.

Theirs are those hopes, by wisdom nam'd,
The day-dreams of the wise,
The wish believ'd as soon as fram'd,
The author's paradise!
Theirs, fortune in idea bright,
Posts, pensions, captivate the sight,
And mitres, and fat benefices;
Her sinecures the state allows,
Already, too, the church bestows
Her flocks and golden fleeces.

Alas!  in Learning's, Nature's spite,
They strain the spotless page;
No sense have they of what they write,
Nor of reviewers' rage:
Yet see how all around them wait,
The angry minister's of fate,
Arm'd with the lash, with venom cramm'd,
Ah, show them where, in ambush stand,
To seize their prey, the murd'rous band&mdash;
Ah tell them they'll be damn'd!!!
