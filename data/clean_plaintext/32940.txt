If that Elizium be no fained thing,
Whereof the Poets wont so much to sing;
Then are those faire fields in this Faerie land,
Which faire Eliza rules with awfull hand:
By BAI th' Aegyptians signifie the soule,
Which doth the bodies appetites controule,
ETH signifies mans hart, from whence we know
The fountaine of their vitall breath doth flow.
ELIZA gives this land the name:  BAI soule; hart ETH
Name, soul, hart, of this land ELIZABETH.
