Ah!  gentil Mersey!  Well I wot thy banckes,
(Atween whose rushy slopes, in summertide,
To raptur'd Fancy's een mote seem to glide,
Brighte Naiad-shapes and nymphes in glitteraund ranckes),
Albeit now, my wearye steps ne more
Emong their broome and dewye wilde flowers goe;
As erst in giddye youthedes wanton pranckes;
Still on mine ee' in many a day-dream sweet,
And lovelye visione of the slombrous nighte,
Doe rise y'clad in lavish verdure bright
Of blossom'd boughs and golden waving wheat,
Dayes long agone eftsoons returne full fleete,
And eke (to crowne the deare deceite) appears
Disporting blythe as erst my bande of jollye freres!
