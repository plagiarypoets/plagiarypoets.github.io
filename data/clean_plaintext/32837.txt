Ah Colin, whether on the lowly plaine,
Pyping to shepherds thy sweete roundelaies;
Or whether singing in some lofty vaine
Heroick deedes, of past or present daies.
Or whether in thy lovely mistres praise,
Thou list to exercise thy learned quill,
Thy muse hath got such grace, and power to please,
With rare invention bewtified by skill.
As who therein can ever joy their fill.
O therefore let that happy muse proceede
To clime the height of vertues sacred hill,
Where endles honor shall be made thy meede,
Because no malice of succeeding daies,
Can rase those records of thy lasting praise.
