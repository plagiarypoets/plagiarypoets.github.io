As thus alone and comfortless I roam,
Wet with the drizzling shower, I sigh sincere,
[Illegible] a fond look tow'rds me native home,
And think what valiant Britons perish'd here.

Yes, the time was, nor very far the date,
When Carnage here her crimson toil began;
When nations' standards wav'd in threat'ning state,
And man the murd'rer met the murd'rer man.

For war is murder, tho' the voice of Kings
Has styl'd it justice, &mdash; styl'd it glory too!
Yet from worst motives fierce ambition springs,
And there fix'd prejudice is all we view!

O let th' aspiring warrior think with grief,
That as protected by chymic art refin'd&mdash;
So glittering conquest, from the laurel leaf,
Extracts a general poison for mankind!

Here let him wander at the midnight hour,
These morbid dreams, these gelid gales to meet;
And mourn, like me, the ravages of power!
And feel, like me, that vic'try is defeat!

Nor deem, ye vain!  that e'er I mean to swell
My feeble verse with many a sounding name;
Of such, the mercenary bard may tell,
And call such dreary desolation fame.

The genuine Muse removes the thin disguise,
That cheats the world, whene'er she deigns to sing;
And full as meritorious to her eyes,
Seems the poor Soldier, as the mighty King.

Yet much my beating breast respects the brave;
Too well I love them, not to mourn their fate;
Why should they look for greatness in the grave?
Their hearts are noble &mdash; and in life they're great.

Nor think 'tis but in war the brave excel,
To valour ev'ry virtue is allied!
Here faithful friendship, 'mid the battle fell,
And love, true love, in bitter anguish died.

Alas, the solemn slaughter I retrace,
That cheks life's current circling thro' my veins;
Bath'd in moist sorrow many a beauteous face,
And gave a grief perhaps that still remains.

I can no more &mdash; an agony too keen,
Absorbs my senses and my mind subdues;
Hard were that heart which here could beat serene,
Or the just tribute of a pang refuse.
