Oh!  ye unbending Glaciers! &mdash; if ye be
Aught more than human view may contemplate&mdash;
If on your crowned heads the Deity
Rests his bright foot eternal, when in state
He bends arrayed in lightnings &mdash; consecrate
Then stand for ever. &mdash; Perchance your heavenward look
Infused such feeling, strong and elevate,
That madness in the soul's bright temple shook&mdash;
Silent ye pointed high &mdash; I read as from a book.

Sacred ye are &mdash; The very eye of God
Darts roses on ye as it shuts at even&mdash;
The earthquake on your breast hath never trod&mdash;
Nor in vast fragments have your limbs been riven&mdash;
Nor through your heart the red volcano driven,
That foams in lava-cataracts from its bound;
Or flings its blazing columns up to heaven,&mdash;
Sinking in darkening ashes on the ground&mdash;
Thus Hecla &mdash; Etna feel &mdash; and all (save ye) around.

And oh!  thou viewless Spirit, who dost breath
Life on the world &mdash; whose home is on the seas,
And plains, and mountain summits &mdash; and beneath
This earth &mdash; whose couriers are the storm and breeze&mdash;
Whose children &mdash; the gay birds &mdash; the beasts &mdash; the trees&mdash;
And we (the monarchs of mortality)
And whatsoe'er hath being &mdash; That thou didst please
To draw from me the mind's calamity,
I thank thee &mdash; Thou hast given the world again to me.

For not alone with Alpine heights my soul
Communed in silence &mdash; 'Twas from forests deep&mdash;
The everlasting ocean, that doth roll
Bursting in thundering billows 'gainst the steep&mdash;
The rainbow, that when summer vapours weep,
Arches the sky &mdash; the free and sightless wind&mdash;
The Moon &mdash; the Sun &mdash; and (last) those firest that keep
Nightly their starry watch &mdash; From all, my mind
Caught light, and strength, and joy &mdash; to no one aid confined&mdash;
