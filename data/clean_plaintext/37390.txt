The bell of Arragon, they say,
Spontaneous speaks the fatal day
When, as its tones peal wild and high,
Iberia's kings are doom'd to die.

Whatever dark aerial power
Commissioned, haunts the gloomy tower,
So deep the spell, each starts with fear
That strange unearthly sound to hear.

O'er me, when death his arm hath flung,
May no such awful knell be rung;
But, breathing mild a last farewell,
Toll sad, yet sweet, some simpler bell!
