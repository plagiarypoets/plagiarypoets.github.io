So Fairy Elves their morning-table spread
O'er a white mushroom's hospitable head:
In acorn cups the merry goblins quaff
The pearly dews, they sing, they love, they laugh;
Melodious music trembles thro' the sky,
And airy sounds along the green-wood die.

THE SAME:  DIVERSIFYED IN AUNCIENT METRE.
So, yf deep clerkes in tymes of your faine trew,
Or poets eyne, perdie, mought sothly vew,
The dapper Elfins thyr queint festes bedight
Wyth mickle pleasaunce on a mushrome lite:
In acorne cuppes they quaffen daint liquere,
And rowle belgardes, and defflie daunce yfere;
Ful everidele they makin musicke sote,
And sowns aeriall adowne the grene woode flote.
