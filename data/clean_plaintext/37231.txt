I saw enthroned upon a mighty pile,
Made up of prostrate altars and white bones,
A horrid image &mdash; and it wore a smile&mdash;
A ghastly smile &mdash; and I did hear the graons
Of victims it had trampled, in shrill tones,
Crying aloud for vengeance &mdash; while around
Men bowed and oped their bosoms, e'en the while
Their heart's blood flowed profusely to the ground,
Where worshipping they died, in chains themselves had bound.

I turn'd in horror from the unholy scene,
When lo!  a lovely figure wandered by,
Unnoticed by the crowd, with brow serene,
On which was written "Peace" and "Piety."
And on the flowery mead, with a soft sigh,
She sat her down, and angels round her clung,
Sipp'd her sweet breath, and worshipped her I wean,
But men came not, for war!  war!  only rung,
And angels carried her their sylvan bowers among.
