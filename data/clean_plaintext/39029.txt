Ye shepherds, while round me ye throng,
And vainly the hours beguile,
Ye cannot admire my song,
Nor I dare not repay you your toil.

Philander, how fatal the day,
When ye led me to Damon's gay bower!
How careless, till then, did I stray,
New pleasures awak'd the young hours.

Though ye sung me the carol of love,
Though ye wove me the garland so fine;
Though to praise me ye each of you strove,
And told me my form was divine;

How fondly I boasted my heart
Could never be caught be your guile;
Too soon I experienc'd the smart,
And my Damon can cause me to smile.

The linnet that sits on yon spray,
But yesterday flew to my breast;
There trembling and panting it lay,
It was robb'd of its young and its nest.

Could I the sweet songster confine,
And heighten the pangs it endur'd,
Its sorrow I judg'd of by mine,
And its liberty quickly secur'd.

This garland, so curiously wove,
Philander but yesterday gave;
Two turtles, sweet emblems of love,
And declar'd I his soul did enslave.

Though he is the pride of the swains,
Tho' with fortune, with humour possess'd,
Tho' with rapture I hear his sweet strains,
And wish I could render him blest:

Yet forbear to pursue me, fond youth,
Thy Delia more bliss shall impart;
She has honour, wit, beauty, and truth,
And you long have possess'd her fond heart.
