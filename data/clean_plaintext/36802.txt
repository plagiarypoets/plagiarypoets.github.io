There is a pensive sweetness in thine eyes,
A mystery and a depth, like that of heaven
When viewed by night without the day's disguise!
Though 'gainst this world my spirit e'er hath striven,
Yet there be deeds of mine to be forgiven;
And, fair Madonna, I would pray to thee
For solace to a heart all wrung and riven;
To features less divine men bend the knee,
And lovelier in the realms of fancy none may see.

Though I have gazed on faces where the eye
Shone forth in beauty like the star of morn
That ushers in the day so tranquilly,&mdash;
And struggleth not as doth the babe new born,
When first it wakes to life 'mid passion's storm;
But steals all gently o'er each earthly bower,
As if it meant to keep the angel form
It thus assumes, in that most heavenly hour,
When it comes forth to wake the world with gentle power:

Yet, there is something like a nameless feeling&mdash;
Of which we're conscious, but know not the cause&mdash;
That hovers round thee, like the daylight stealing
O'er Nature's face &mdash; ere man infringed her laws,
Or earth beheld the curtain sin still draws
Between high Heaven and this inglorious spot;
Where, if one blessing falls, it is because
Lost virtue never can be all forgot;
And if it brings eternal bliss, 'twill be thy lot.

'Tis this all nameless thing that dwells in thee,
The essence of thy being, thy mind's light,
Thy soul in more than infant purity,
That makes both eye and star set to the sight,
When thou art near, with something still more bright&mdash;
Shining in silence like the pale moonbeam,&mdash;
When it reveals the glories of the night,
And makes this earth to me seem like a dream,
And thou the fair pervading spirit of the scene.

Speed on thy journey through this world below,
Thou loveliest of thy kind, and most divine!
Though I would kingdoms for thy sake forego,
I would not link thy destinies to mine,
Nor with my fortunes aught of thee enshrine,
Because I could not brook the blight that then
Would fall, and break that tranquil peace of thine.
That aught like thee should ever wear a stain,
Would make the heavens to blush, and double all my pain.
