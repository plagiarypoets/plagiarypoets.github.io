O CHANTREY!  thou hast stolen the feeling all
Of Nature's young and innocent worshipers,
Of those whose hearts keep holy festival
Through the fair seasons of their beauteous years;
Whose feet go printless over woe; whose tears
But gem the looks of gladness where they light;
Whose lips are wet with honey; while the fears,
Waylaying mortal joys, may never fright
The soul from its repast, pure, sensitive, and light.

For when the blight of ugly Death had thrown
Its lustre from that seat of love, the eye,
Then camest thou, and in thy chisell'd stone
Hewedest out these an immortality.
While their free spirits sought to glorify
The holiness of innocence with wings,
Thou had'st their fairy forms entraced lie,
As if they dreamt of Heaven, and lovely things
That Future still to Youth in radiant beauty brings.

O artist!  pity thou couldst not bestow
The breath into those lips that gently part;
And give the warm blood in those veins to flow,
That seem to converse with the throbbing heart;
And bid that perfect foot with ardent start,
Climb the bright Helicon of Life's domain;&mdash;
Pity!  yet hardly so; &mdash; man has no art
To wake the youthful melody again;
And joy is oft, at best, the holiday of pain.

Sweet forms!  sweet memories of what have been!
Fair triumphs of a noble art!  ye lie
Mocking at things of flesh, in all your green,
And everlasting freshness.  Oh!  gone by
I have known forms like yours, &mdash; yet they could die!
But your sweet sympathies shall perish not;
And ye, like rainbows promise-bent on high,
Shall point the mourner from his earthly spot,
To where immortal youth is joy's perculiar lot.
