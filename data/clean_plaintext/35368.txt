Blest pair!  how fast the snowy-pinion'd hours,
Fled, when Wit, Sense, and Harmony, combining
Beneath your friendly roof their witching powers
Awhile my spirit charm'd from sad repining:
O then!  to pleasure all my soul resigning,
Too soon for me, the happy moments fled;
Too soon alas!  my transient bliss declining,
Again I bent to Earth my weary head.
Life's rugged pathway, woe-begone I tread,
And, musing, tremble for my future years,
That hid in darkness fill my soul with dread:
O never your's, may heart-benumbing fears,
Or stren misfortunes, with rude hand annoy,
But all be one fair day of harmony and joy.
