"Come to the heights wi' me bonny Jean,
The sun he is just i' the rise,
The blue lift'is a spangled wi' sheen,
And the lav'rock's hich i' the skies.

"The dewy drops shine sweet on the bud,
The gouk's serenading the grove,
And the wild dows i' ilka green wood
As sweetly are cooing their love."

"It is health to walk out i' the morn,
There's life i' the balmy air;
We'll woo by our favourite thorn,
Till the laive o' the shepherds appear."

"Indeed, Jamie, I winnae gang
For nae pretension or pray'r,
Yestreen ye wi' Marion was thrang
And whan ye woo ye're sincere.

"Ye fancied there was nae body saw,
When ye came hame frae the height,
Ye Marion decoyed to the shaw,
And ye ken gyn ye did right&mdash;

"Her head was fair towsle'd I wat,&mdash;
Her cheeks war red as the glied,&mdash;
Her breast it play'd ay pit-a-pat&mdash;
And she sicht fair i' her bed.&mdash;

"And whan she look't at ye niest day,
The blush owr-crimson'd her face;
But it was nae the look o' dismay,
Nor yet the blush o' distress.&mdash;

"And whan that I jeer'd her a wee,
She tauntin' bade me gie o'er,
Said 'She was looed better than me,
By ane ne'er thought o' before.'

"I hae right i' my side, Jamie lad,
Sin' I've been faithfu' to you:&mdash;
An' truth cannae roose the yound blade
What lichtly loups o'er his vow."

"Ah Jean!  I ne'er thought your fair breast,
On whilk I hae aft reclin'd,
Could e'er harbour a thought o' distrust,
Or reck her shepherd unkind.

"May my lambkins a' die i' the fauld,
My kye hae distempers arise,
An' myself ne'er grow lyart or auld,
Gif ever Marion's my wife."

Jeany lap to his arms like a rae,
Wi' hounds an' hunters pursu'd;
An' a that she had spoken that day&mdash;
She blushin' and greetin' rued.

Sae eas'ly's the untutored heart
Ay made to love or disdain,
When alternately pleasure and smart
Removes or confirms its pain.
