Hast thou ere seen a sunset in these climes,
And marked the splendour of our evening's close,
And heard the knell which lonely faqueer chimes
To daylight, when it sinks into repose
With blush more deep than what adorns the rose,
And calmer smile than that of dying saint,&mdash;
Reflected on the glowing mountain snows
In tints no artist's pen may ever paint,
Lovely, and lovelier still, as they become more faint?

They soften into twilight; and the peaks
Of high Himaleh mingle in the grey
Of evening, &mdash; till the slowly fading streaks
Of light, concentrate in one lingering ray,
Upon the broad horizon.  Doth it stay
To promise, e'en as now it yields to night,
Another and another happy day?
Lo!  it has fled; &mdash; that last, loved trace of light;
And darkness reigns alone, where all so late was bright!

Spreads the black shadow o'er a cheerless sky;
The dew-drop on the leaf hangs like a tear;
The jackall wails, with wild and mournful cry,
O'er nature's gloom; and all is sad and drear;&mdash;
Until yon crescent, mounting in her sphere,
A bark of light on blue and waveless sea,
Sailing through the wide heaven, so pale, so clear,
Blesses the earth's deep slumbers, o'er which she
Loves unobserved to dwell in silver radiancy!
