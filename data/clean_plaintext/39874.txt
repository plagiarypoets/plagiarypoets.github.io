Of late a fond couple alone,
In the bar of a coffee-house sat,
Where the swain, Mr. Thaddy Mahone,
Sigh'd hard at the plump Mrs. Pratt.

His praises so pointedly gay,
The widow received with a smile&mdash;
She heard he soft things he could say,
But she counted her silver the while.

"Mrs. Pratt," the fond shepherd began,
"How can you be cruel to me?
I'm a love sick and thirsty young man;
Oh!  give me some gunpowder tea?

"For rolls never trouble your mind,
I feast when I look upon you;
To my love let your answer be kind,
And half a potatoe will do."

"No trouble at all, sir, indeed,"
Said the lady, and gave him a leer,
"Do you wish today's paper to read;
Will you please, sir, to take your tea here?"

"Will I take my tea here?  that I will;
But I never read papers and books;
Be pleas'd, Ma'am, the tea-pot to fill,
You sweeten the tea with your looks.

"Saint Patrick!  I've emptied the pot,"
Exclaimed the stout Monaghan youth,
"But, my honey, your tea is so hot,
It has scalded the top of my tooth.

"How well your good time you employ!
May I beg for a jug of your cream?
The water's so warm, my dear joy,
My whiskers are singed by the steam.

"Mrs. Pratt, you are an angel in face,
How I doat on your fingers so fair;
Oh, I long like a dragon to place,
Another gold wedding ring there.

"Do you think, now, my lies are untrue?
You may shut those sweet eyes of your own,
And never see one that loves you,
Like myself, Mr. Thaddy Mahone.

"Come join your estate to my own,
And then what a change we shall see!
When you are the flesh of my bone,
What a beautiful charmer I'll be!

"I have fields in my farm at Kilmore,"
Again Mrs. Pratt gave a leer,
And all that he manfully swore,
She drank with a feminine ear.

But scarce did the widow begin
To answer her lover so gay,
When, alas!  a bum-bailiff came in,
And took Mr. Thaddy away.
