Still does reluctant Sol refuse,
Courted by milk-maids, ah!  in vain,
To chase the damps, exhale the dews,
Heal influenza's madd'ning pain.
Must this auspicious day once more
Be clouded like these heretofore!
Shall show'rs impregnate with malignant air,
'Tis Galen's fondest wish, and Galen's gen'ral prayer.

O yes!  in yonder pregnant sky,
Whence all our hopes, and bus'ness spring,
New barking patients drooping lie,
New fees in golden show'rs are on the wing,
The ling'ring morn that coyly sheds
On bursting clouds, and aching heads
At first a rainy day,
Now thicker, and now thinner pours
Wide, and more wide, the dreary showers,
Without one cheering ray.
And Earth bemoaning, in her hood-wink'd flight,
Dissolves in dreary damps, and live-long sleepless night.

Satiate of tears, whose mad excess
No bound, no kind restriction knows,
Flood mark their progress with distress,
The half-drown'd lambkins want repose;
And poets waking from their dreams
Of golden showers, illusive schemes!
Shall build new castles in the air,
And hail, with raven-voice, the day that first is fair.
CAETERA DESUNT.
