47.  DESCRIPTION OF PRINCE ARTHUR IN HIS HABILIMENTS OF WAR.

Upon the top of all his lofty crest
A bunch of hairs, discolour'd diversly
With sprinkled pearl, and gold full richly drest;
Did shake, and teem'd to dance for jollity,
Like to an almond-tree ymounted high
On top of green Selinis all alone,
With blossoms brave bedecked daintily;
Whose tender looks do tremble every one
At every little blast that under heav'n is blown.
