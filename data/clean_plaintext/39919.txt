Ah!  whither bright Phoebus so fast?
Why post it so quickly away?
To what distant climate such haste,
Great source, and sole Regent of day?

The flowrets &mdash; not one now remains,
For gone is their life-beaming God;
Save daisies, a few on the plains,
That languish and droop on the clod.

Dear vi'lets, your loss I bemoan,
But, destin'd by FATE was your doom;
My pinks, but for this were you blown,
And PHILLIS was fond of your bloom.

Dispoil'd are the jessamines of green,
Their fragrance the woodbines have lost;
A rose-bud &mdash; not one to be seen,
Enchain'd lies the riv'let by frost.

The blackbird's mellifluous notes,
No more from the thickets resound;
No linnets distend their sweet throats,
No songster of joy to be found.

All, all seem in sadness to mourn,
Distorted and ransack'd the year;
But Phoebus, in sooth, will return,
And joy to illumine the sphere.

So Man (for his date is no more)
Just passes, we sorrow a while;
The year of his life is but o'er,
And Mirth gives the pleasure-form'd smile.
