Come, let us sing, that God may have the glorie,
Some noble act; and let mine auditore
Bee of the best:  my Lyra now is strung,
And English, which I sing in, is a tongue.
The victory Saint Michael did obtaine
Against the Dragon in the open plaine,
And mooving champaine of the triple aer,
As brave a subject as high heavens are faire.
I see those captaines, and their armies trie
The quarrell in all regions of the skie;
I see thicke mists, windes, whirle-windes, drizling dew,
Cold meteors next above, and how fires shew,
And all the state of those parts troubled quite:
Was never seen so great and strange a sight.
And whither Decasyllabons will you goe?
Great was the combat, great the overthrow
Which our Saint George did to this Dragon give,
Whose fame in Spensers Red-crosse Knight doth live:
Thither repair who love descriptions life,
There hangs the table of the noble strife
The spirit, and the sense of things our care is.
Wisdome is Queene, who fareth not with Faeries.
Th' Arch-angels battle is a truth divine,
And that brave picture which Great Constantine,
Caus'd to bee limn'd over his palace-gate,
And which Eusebius so doth celebrate
Had secret reason.  There that Prince doth tread,
Under his feet, a Dragon prostrated,
Not upon ground but upon surging sea,
Salutations ensigne for a canopie.
Bring under mee, sweet God, that Dragons head,
Which Doeg, and his likes so long have fed,
Against maine honour, and mine innocence,
With worlds of lies through madnesse and offence:
O free mee once from wrongs, once lift mee high
Above the jawes and reach of Calumnie,
Whose voyce barkes lowder then all Scylla's doggs,
And breath is fowler then are all the foggs
Of Stygian fenne, that in a cleere renowne
My soule may mount with joy to vertues crowne,
Nor hide my praise for better were I dye,
Then that my glorie in the dust should lie.
