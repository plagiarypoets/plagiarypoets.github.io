Low in a barren vale I see thee sit
Cowering, while Winter blows his shivering blast,
Over thy reedy fire &mdash; pale, comfortless!
Blest independence, with elastic foot,
Spurns thy low dwelling, whilst the sons of joy
Turn from thy clouded brow, or, with a scowl,
Contemptuous, mark thee.  At thy elbow stand
Famine and wan disease!  two meagre forms,
Thy only visitants, who, though repelled,
Officious tend thee &mdash; wretched eremite!
Around thy cell, ah!  wherefore see I graved
The sacred names of genius?  Spenser here
Found his last refuge!  Otway!  Butler, too!
And Scotia's last, not least, heroic bard!
