High on a hill's green bosom laid,
All undisturb'd my fancy stray'd,
And o'er the landscape ran:
What various scenes the seasons show!
What share of happiness and wo
Is doom'd to toiling man!

Along the hill the lambkins bleat,
The oxen low beneath my feet,
Down in the grassy dale;
The golden sheaves the reapers bind,
The ploughman whistles near behind,
And breaks the new-mown vale.

Hail KNOWLEDGE!  gift of Heav'n, I cry'd,
E'en all the gifts of Heav'n beside,
Compar'd to thee, how low!
The blessings of the earth, and air,
The beasts of fold and forest share,
But god-like beings KNOW.

How mean the short-liv'd joys of sense!
But, oh!  how grand the excellence
Of Wisdom's sacred lore!
All dead the Greeks and Romans lie,
Yet still can Wisdom's piercing eye
Their mighty deeds explore.

She sees the little Spartan band,
With great Leonidas, withstand
The Asian world in arms;
She hears the heav'nly sounds that hung
On Homer's and on Plato's tongue,
And glows at Tully's charms.

The wonders of the spacious sky
She penetrates with Newton's eye,
And marks the planets roll:
She lays the human mind quite bare,
With Locke, and shews what really are
The movements of the soul.

How matter takes ten thousand forms
Of metals, plants, of men and worms,
She joys to trace, with Boyle.
This life she deems an infant state,
A gleam that bodes a life complete,
When done the mortal toil.

What thousand ills in life befall!
Yet wisdom learns to scorn them all,
And arms the breast with steel:
E'en Death's pale face no horror wears;
But Oh!  what horrid pangs and fears
Unknowing wretches feel!

The happy breast where Knowledge shines,
Is richer than the Mexic mines;
But ah!  how dark and low
Yon peasant's uninstructed mind!
His thoughts how foolish and confin'd!
Nor cares he more to know.

The last two tenants of the ground,
Of ancient times his hist'ry bound;
Alas!  it scarce goes higher:
In vain to him is Shakespear's strain,
The eloquence of Pitt in vain;
In vain is Milton's fire.

Not sun by day, nor stars by night,
Can give his soul the grand delight,
To trace almighty power:
His ox thinks just as much as he
Of Nature's vast variety,
In animal and flower.

As thus I sung, a solemn sound
Accosts my ear!  I look'd around,
And, lo!  an ancient sage,
A venerable man, stood near,
At a cave's mouth, where many a year
Had been his hermitage.

His mantle gray flow'd loose behind,
His snowy beard wav'd in the wind,
And added solemn grace;
His broad bald front gave dignity,
Attention mark'd his lively eye,
And peace smil'd in his face.

He beckon'd with his wrinkled hand;
My ear was all at his command,
And thus the sage began:
Godlike it is to know, I own:
But O!  how little can be known,
By poor short-sighted man!

The mole may to the slow worm boast,
Of rays and light to him all lost;
But, say, how vain his pride!
Such art thou when of wisdom vain;
Superior ranks thy ALL disdain,
And both alike deride.

Wisdom, you boast, to you is given;
At night, then, view the fires of heaven,
And let thy mind explore;
Swift as the lightning let it fly,
From star to star, from sky to sky,
Still, still are millions more.

Th' immense ideas strike the soul
With pleasing horror, and controul
Thy wisdom's empty boast,
What are they? &mdash; Thou canst never say:
Then silent adoration pay,
And be in wonder lost.

Thy knowledge at the best how small!
How faint and how imperfect all
Thou know'st of what has been;
Been done e'en in this world below!
And what a nothing dost thou know
Of what is by thee seen!

How can the self-same root produce
The wholesome food and pois'nous juice?
Say can thy reason find?
Say, why pure white and red the rose,
While always green the foliage grows,
With prickles arm'd the rhind?

Why bends the strong ox to the yoke,
While wild the roebuck roams unbroke?
Or, mark these sportive lambs;
Now scatter'd o'er the hill they stray,
Now weary of their gambling play,
All single out their dams.

Instinct directs &mdash; but what is that?
Fond man, thou never canst say what.
Nay hold &mdash; thou must not call
It Reason; no. &mdash; By slow degrees
The useful arts of men increase,
But this at once is all.

A trunk first floats along the deep,
Long ages still improve the ship,
'Till she commands the shore,
But never bird improv'd her nest,
Each all at once of pow'rs possest,
As can receive no more.

Why then, O man!  shouldst thou be vain
Of what thou never canst attain,
But in a small degree?
To know thy blindness all thy reach;
In every science all thy stretch,
But learns humility.

For still the more thou know'st, the more
Thou wilt the emptiness deplore
Of all thy soul can find.
This life, a sickly woeful dream,
A burial of the soul will seem,
A palsy of the mind;

Still wilt thou plan some fav'rite scheme
Of happiness, and still the dream,
As morning-shadows, flies.
Or if thou gain'st the long-sought joy,
Just in thy grasp its charms shall die,
And thou the gift despise.

Tho' knowledge scorns the vulgar fear
Of death, alas!  it points the spear
Of many a nameless wo:
Thy delicacy dips the dart
In venom, and gives double smart
As vulgar minds ne'er know.

How happy, then, the simple mind
Of yon unknowning lab'ring hind,
Where all is smiling peace;
No high ideas of true joy
His present happiness destroy,
Nor rob one moment's ease.

The stings neglected merit feels,
The pangs the virtuous soul conceals,
When crush'd by wayward Fate,
Against them all his lot is proof:
Below the peasant's humble roof,
Few heart-felt sorrows wait.

Knowledge or Wealth to few are given;
But, see how just the ways of Heaven,
True joy to all is free:
Nor Wealth nor Knowledge grant the boon
That thou, O Virtue!  claim alone,
It all belongs to thee!

With thee &mdash; how bless'd the shepherd lives!
Gay is his morn; his evening gives
Content and sweet repose;
Without thee &mdash; jaded, fretted, cloy'd,
The chief feels all a mighty void,
Mad joy and real woes.

Thou, tho' the gout, or fiercer stone,
Shall make the very soul to groan,
Still giv'st a bless'd alloy;
Daughter of God, thou know'st, thy sire
But chastens thee to raise thee higher,
And crown thy final joy.

Be virtuous, then, O man!  and wise,
If thou wouldst in true grandeur rise
Above th' unknowing hind;
Then shalt thou be sublimely blest,
And with a better relish taste
The pleasures of the mind.

So spake the sage &mdash; my heart reply'd,
How blind how mad is human pride!
All joy how false and vain,
But that from thee, O Virtue!  flows,
That triumphs in the midst of woes,
And boasts an endless reign.
