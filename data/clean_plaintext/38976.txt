O gentle Bard!  full much I wonder
Why you should quote this son of thunder;
Not more amaz'd to cast my eye on
A tailor flirting with a lion!
Whether you gravely write, or gaily,
You're still the gentle Mr. &mdash;,
In style prosaic tagg'd with rhyme,
Monstrously flat and unsublime,
Which sometimes buckrams into rant
By aid of sentimental cant;
Such as reminds us of the plan
Of Harvey and of Bunyan.
With Mason Mr. H. glories
In metaphysic allegories,
Where words which prose-men term abstract,
By epithets are made to act;
Compell'd on their reluctant duties,
And Spenser's faults are H.'s duties.
