Oh, I must weep &mdash; it soothes the lonely heart,
But little will my fondest tears avail&mdash;
The bark, that lost to guiding star and chart
Bounds on unknowingly before the gale,
Has pictured life in poet's ethic tale,
And it may picture mine &mdash; the hallowed star
That shewed the path has failed &mdash; I saw it fail&mdash;
I saw the gloom its lovely lustre mar,
Then sink, and slowly vanish, from the things that are.

Even now, methought, again I hailed its beam&mdash;
Beheld the joy of other days return&mdash;
How my fond heart did leap to hail the gleam
Of that sweet light that long had ceased to burn!
Ah no! . . . the dead will not forsake the urn&mdash;
It was a dream &mdash; 'twas sweet and swiftly o'er. . .
Like shipwrecked mariner alone and worn,
His treasure in the deep &mdash; himself on desert shore&mdash;
I see a wildering waste behind and dread to look before!

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

All woe-begone I laid me down to sleep,
And dreams arose &mdash; dreams of the silent dead&mdash;
I stood where Bertha's stream with azure sweep
Rolls its broad waters o'er their oozy bed&mdash;
The boughs were green, and waving o'er my head,
And Mary stood before me bathed in tears,
And lovely still, save that the glow had fled
Her lips and cheek &mdash; those lips in other years
That sweetly smiled me into love &mdash; its hopes and fears!

I rushed to fold her in my opening arms&mdash;
To weep away the sorrows of my breast&mdash;
To gaze once more upon those long lost charms. . .
"Sorrow no more," she said, "it breaks my rest. . .
That I do feel thy woes, those tears attest:
For spirits sympathize in human care&mdash;
The bourne is past &mdash; I mingle with the blest,
A little while and thou shalt meet me there,
To part no more" . . . she smiled, and melted into air. . .

I woke &mdash; the tear-drop gathered in my eye,
I felt that I had heard an angel's voice,
Bidding my troubled soul suppress its sigh,
And half my heart essayed to rejoice&mdash;
But oh, she was my bosom's early choice;
And while I dreamt of joy, the spoiler came. . . .
In her I saw the end of earthly joys&mdash;
And I must weep &mdash; I love to breathe her name,
But feel that wanting her, life has no farther aim. . . .
