Here, I may breathe "Farewell" &mdash; here, hang the lyre:
On this rent stone, the Muses' altar, pay
One grateful tribute, one memorial lay;
Ere with slow step reluctant I retire,
Recall'd from visions of the Bards of old,
Who sang of Saturn's realm, and feign'd an age of gold.

Throughout the charmed air the echoes float
Of Latian songs:  a voice from Anio breathes:
Or where through trembling reeds slow Mincius wreathes
His winding way:  and soft and sweet the note
Comes from the Bard who mourn'd in Sirmio's cave,
And still'd to peace the storm that swell'd Benacus' wave.

Flow on, ye sounds of Inspiration flow!
And Thou, creative Fancy breathe the spell
That draws the visions to this haunted cell!
Give all, that charm'd my sight, again to glow,
And, ere the disinchanted colours fade,
Brighten each beauteous tint, and soothe each harsher shade.

Yet, yet again before my wistful sight
Fix each far bound of that wide-varying scene,
And all of loveliest view that rose between:
Here, poise Mont-Blanc on his aerial height,
Th' eternal Monarch on his mountain throne,
Who, when earth sinks in shade, looks on the sun, alone:

There, spread the waste beyond Salerno's bay
And silver cliffs with tower and convent crown'd;
And to my search expose that hallow'd ground
Where age on age rolls on unfelt away,
While rob'd in Dorian stole, chaste, stern, sublime,
Genius from Paestum's fane turns back the scythe of Time.
