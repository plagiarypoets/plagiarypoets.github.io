Not the winter which mellows the earth,
And defends by a carpet of snow,
Not the spring, which to nature gives birth,
Nor the summer's more vehement glow;
'Tis the autumn alone that can yield
Aught the farmer thinks worthy his sight;
'Tis the produce alone of his field
Which affords him a moment's delight.

Not the faint rosy blush of the morn,
Nor the bright-beaming glories of day,
When the sun to the center is borne,
And the clouds fly before him away;
Not the ev'ning, all soft and serene,
When the god bending down to the west,
Leaves the nymphs and the swains of the green
To recline on his Thetis's beast;

Nor the silver-bright beauties of night,
Full orb'd when the sun does appear,
Can engage for a moment his sight,
Or suspend for a moment his care.
Surrounded with all that is fair,
Surveying each beauty that grows;
If it rains &mdash; why the wretch will despair,
And revile the great cause, if it snows.

If the sun shines &mdash; 'twill burn up his corn,
And the wind will destroy all his fruit;
And if cloudy advances the morn,
More cloudy &mdash; behold the vile brute.
Thus unconscious of beauty he strays,
Where beauties alone can be seen;
And heeds not the winde of the maze,
And regards not the sweets of the green.
