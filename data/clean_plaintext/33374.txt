1.
Cease, cease Pierian dames,
Be henceforth mute,
Leave of your wanton games,
Apollos lute
Hath crackt a stringe:  it grates my eares,
'Tis harsh, as are the heavenly spheares:
List Willie sings and tunes his oaten reed,
To whom all hearts, all eares doe yield themselves:  as meed.

2.
Hearke, hearke, the joylly lad
So sweetly sings,
The vales as proude, as glad
The murmuring springes:
Both joyne to tell the neighbour hills
That theres no musicke like to Willes.
Eccho enamoured one the pipinge swaine
Recovers (sylly wretch!)  her voice, repeats each straine.

3.
The bucksome sheepheardesse
Hearke!  ha!  no more ?
Ah!  what unhappinesse
Wast left us poore,
Brereft by thy neglected songs
Of life, of joy!  tell tell what wrongs
What sad disaster (Willie) is betide,
That we thy laies (not yet half done) should be denyed?

4.
What has some satyre rude,
Wode to those groves
His wily snares bestrewd
To catch your loves?
To tempt a credlous sheepheardesse,
Who crying out in her distresse,
Have made you breake or flinge your pipe away,
Oh no!  your charmes would erst have made the monster stay.&mdash;

5.
Or is your pipe ybroke,
And 'twill not sounde?
Goe, goe unto the oake
By youder mounde:
Take Colins pipe (there't hangs) in hand,
Or if not that you may command
The whillome jolly swaine's PHILICIDES,
But ah your broken pipe will sound as well as these.

6.
Has subtell Reynard caught
A friskinge lambe,
Or the fearce woolfe distraught
The bleatinge dam?
And you by riffling of their folds,
Which to regaine your sport witholds,
Or has your lagginge ewe a lambkin yean'd,
Which makes you cease your notes, and midwifrie attend.

7.
Or did some sheepheards boy
(Thy layes are good,)
Nods head or pause and coy,
He understood,
Not that it which he did soe taunt
(If there were such) dull ignorant,
Or else despairinge ere to rise so high,
Would worke thee swaine from thy deserved supremacy.

8.
Did the round yesterday,
Which thou beganst
Soe merriely to play,
Thou them entraunct'st?
O did they rayse thy worth soe high,
And made thee blush for modestie:
Did they with garlands girt thy curled locks,
Cald thee fine piper while thou lookest all griefe for mocks.

9.
And would th' had wood thee too,
A second part,
Cause from their promisd vow
They gan to start:
In which th' hadst bound their seely swaine
Nor to commend nor praise thy veine,
Yet when they did begin, and who could spare,
Thou cruell torst thy chaplets, and wouldst willow weare.

10.
See cruell faire, see, see
Each sheapheards brow,
That wont to smile with glee,
Is tearswolne now;
And prisninge up their pearly wealth,
The straglinge drops get out by stealth,
Yet could they hope to win thee for their prize,
To finish up thy song theyde bankerupt all their eyes.

11.
The pretty birds were mute
To heare thee singe,
And see the shepheard youth
All wantonninge;
When having ceast thy noates all fitty,
They all reservd there mournful dittye:
Philomel fearinge tis her fate denyes,
Thy sweeter accents falls into thy breast and dyes.

12.
The winds that erst were whist
Beginne to roare,
Each tree your songes beinge mist,
Skreeks as before:
Each sproutinge pauncie in the meade
For griefe begins to hang a head,
The weepinge brooke in grumblinge tones glide doune,
Dimples its once sleeke cheeks, and thanks you with a frowne.

13.
Come, come lets heare your skill,
Here say you can't,
What are you angrie still,
By Pan you sha'nt.
Nere let your modestie deprive
Y' of what will keepe your name alive,
Whilst ore the curld-haird-Tavies flowery side
There does on shepheard lodge or seely sheepe abide.

14.
Oh let not nice conceit,
You are too younge,
That there are lads more feete
Ith shepheards thronge,
Who better able are distill
There soule in sonnets at their will,
If still to me you be obdurate then,
Let sheepe, birds, trees,winds, flowers, brooks, teach thee melt again.
