HOPE is a Charm that sooths the lab'ring Mind
The pleasing OPIUM of the afflicted Soul;
In it alone the Wretched Comfort find,
For lively HOPE can ev'ry Care controul.
My beating Bosom is a well wrought CAGE,
Whence this sweet GOLDFINCH never shall elope,
Her Musick all my Sorrows can assuage,
So soft the Songs of Heart deluding HOPE.
