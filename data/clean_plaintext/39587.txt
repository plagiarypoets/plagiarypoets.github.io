Beautiful Spirit, who dost sit at eve
Within thy tapestried hall of shield and spear,
Upgazing where the dying sun-beams leave
The Heaven in crimson &mdash; on thy cheek a tear
Like dew upon the red rose, quivering clear&mdash;
From thy pale brow half-raised thy Nun-like blood&mdash;
Thy ruby lip half-opened, as to hear
Some floating music of the sky or wood&mdash;
Come sweet Romance!  from thine enchanted solitude.

Not for myself I woo thee now to stand
Beside the harp.  Loved spirit, spread thy wings,
Of veiling splendour, over one whose hand
Wakes its first music from the golden rings;
For he is thy true votary, and clings
To thy fallen altar, with a love sublime,
And brings a gift of wild and witching things
From glorious Greece &mdash; from the Italian mime,
A coronal of gems from the rich depths of time.
