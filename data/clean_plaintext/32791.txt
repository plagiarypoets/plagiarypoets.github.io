BAIAZET.
Leave me my Lords untill I call you foorth,
For I am heavie and disconsolate.

EXEUNT ALL BUT BAIAZET.
So Baiazet, now thou remainest alone,
Unrip the thoughts that harbour in thy brest,
And eate thee up, for arbiter heres none,
That may discrie the cause of thy unrest,
Unlesse these walles thy secret thoughts declare,
And Princes walles they say, unfaithfull are.
Why thats the profit of great regiment,
That all of us are subject unto feares,
And this vaine shew and glorious intent,
Privie suspition on each scruple reares,
I, though on all the world we make extent,
From the South-pole unto the Northern beares,
And stretch our raign from East to Western shore,
Yet doubt and care are with us ever more.
Looke how the earth clad in her sommers pride,
Ebroydereth her mantle gorgiously,
With fragrant hearbes, and flowers gaily dide,
Spreading abroad her spangled Tapistrie:
Yet under all a loathsome snake doth hide.
Such is our life, under Crownes, cares do lie,
And feare the scepter still attends upon,
Oh who can take delight in kinlgy throne?
Publike disorders joyn'd with private carke,
Care of our friends, and of our children deare,
Do tosse our lives, as waves a silly barke.
Though we be fearelesse, tis not without feare,
For hidden mischiefe lurketh in the darke:
And stormes may fall, be the day nere so cleare.
He knows not what it is to be a King,
That thinks a scepter is a pleasant thing.
Twice fifteen times hath faire Latonaes sonne
Walked about the world with his great light:
Since I began, would I had nere begunne
To sway this scepter....
