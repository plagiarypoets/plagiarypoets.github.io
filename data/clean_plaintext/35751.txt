The man that looks, sweet Sidney, in thy face,
Beholding there love's truest majesty,
And the soft image of departed grace,
Shall fill his mind with magnanimity:
There may he read unfeign'd humility,
And golden pity, born of heavenly brood,
Unsullied thoughts of immortality,
And musing virtue, prodigal of blood:
Yes, in this map of what is fair and good,
This glorious index of a heavenly book,
Not seldom, as in youthful years he stood,
Divinest Spencer would admiring look;
And, framing thence high wit and pure desire,
Imagined deeds, that set the world on fire.
