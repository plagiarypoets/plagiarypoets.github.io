I have liv'd many seasons &mdash; and I stand
Nor low nor lofty on this world at last:
Yet, with some hope (which I cannot withstand)
I shall not wholly bow me to the blast,
Nor, all unknown, like a base weed be cast
Away, and wither in my wint'ry grave,
Shaming the soil that fed me &mdash; For the past,&mdash;
'Tis gone &mdash; and 'twould be idle now to rave
Of wasted hours, or mourn &mdash; I am not folly's slave.

Yet like a pestilence, despondence hung
Upon the spirit of my prime &mdash; In vain
I sought for cure &mdash; like wasting fire it clung
Against my heart &mdash; it struck upon my brain&mdash;
Then, like a lion bursting from its chain,
For I was not the fool of phantasy,
I rush'd away, and rid me of my pain;
And, with that courage that becomes the free,
Stood on the verge again &mdash; safe &mdash; for at liberty.

In deep embowering woods I built my home
For nature nurses best the sickly mind;
And when Apollo thro' my leafy dome
Came visiting, I rose &mdash; at eve, reclin'd,
I caught strange secrets from the whispering wind,
That with its cooling freshness bath'd my head
As with Olympian dews &mdash; 'twas then my mind
Gather'd its powers &mdash; and, sickly visions fled,
I stood like a man new-born &mdash; recover'd from the dead.&mdash;

It is upon the mountains &mdash; the vast sea&mdash;
That we hear Nature's language &mdash; 'tis the tide
Which rolls for ever speaks 'Eternity:'
The hills declare she is to Heaven allied:
And in the thunder comes her voice of pride:
Her mirror is the lake:  her garb the field
With all the colours of the Iris dyed:
Somewhat of mighty moment doth she yield
From every part.  To me, her soul she hath revealed.

For I did woo her in my early youth,
And sought the marvels of her lonely ways;
And often in those fountain depths, where truth
Springs from its parent source, I loved to gaze&mdash;
And watch'd its many wanderings, where it strays
The world's rude rocks, and 'wildering woods among;
And where the elemental lightnings blaze
I've trod &mdash; aye, stood above 'em &mdash; while along
The precipice they play'd &mdash; wild &mdash; glittering &mdash; and strong.

I've roamed amongst the eternal Alps &mdash; I've stood
And gazed upon the diminish'd world below;
Marking, at frightful distance, field and flood
And spire and town, like things of pigmy show,
Shrink into nothing:  while these peaks of snow
(Which yet the winds themselves but seldom  climb)
Arose like giants from the void below,
But fashion'd all for everlasting time&mdash;
Imperishable  things &mdash; unstain'd, as 'twere, by crime.

I've seen the setting sun &mdash; there &mdash; oh!  how weak
My verse to tell what flash'd across  my sight
Green, blue, and burning red was every streak&mdash;
Like rainbow-beams &mdash; but trebly, trebly bright;
The earth &mdash; the air &mdash; the heavens &mdash; were living light:
My vision was absorbed &mdash; I trembled &mdash; then
Softening his glance, and sinking in his might,
The Sun slow faded from the eyes of men,
And died away.  Ne'er have I seen the like again.

Yet have I lain in many a leafy nook
Sequester'd &mdash; hiding from the summer beam&mdash;
Idling &mdash; or haply with that charmed book,
Writ by the Avon side; and loved to dream
Of pale Cordelia &mdash; gentle Imogene&mdash;
Or, on some brook that slid, like guilt, away,
Hurrying the pilfered mosses down its stream,
Pondered &mdash; and often, at the close of day,
Gazed on the coming Moon, and felt, perchance, her sway.

It is in high, remoter scenes, that we
Become sublim'd &mdash; yet humble:  there we learn
That still beyond us spreads &mdash; Infinity&mdash;
And we still &mdash; clay:  or, all admiring, turn
To where those characters of beauty burn,
Which God hath printed on the starry skies:
And haply guess why we alone may learn
The world's vast wonders &mdash; why alone our eyes
See far &mdash; why we alone have such proud sympathies.

For with creation and its marvels, none,
Save we, can hold communion.  On the earth
Are many stately footsteps, and the Sun
Shines on eyes bright as ours:  yet hath our birth
Holy shed round us an immortal worth,
Beyond the rest &mdash; tho' with the rest we fade,
And are encircled by as frail a girth
To life, as they &mdash; and in the deadly shade
Wither as quick, and are as loathsome when decayed.

But while we live, the air &mdash; the fruit &mdash; the flower
Doth own to us a high, a superior charm
And the soul's radiance in our wint'ry hour
Flings a sweet summer halo round us &mdash; warm&mdash;
And then &mdash; the multitudinous things that swarm
From the brain's secret cells, and never die,
Tho mortal born &mdash; Oh!  for that boasted balm
Of life!  to raise the mighty when they lie
Wrecks, both in frame and mind &mdash; common mortality.

Seems it not hard, that they whose spirits have
Engendered, and matured such thoughts sublime,
And lived but for the world &mdash; must in the grave
At last sink like the things of folly &mdash; crime&mdash;
Ere yet the soul hath blossom'd in its prime?
For who may tell how high the labouring thought
Might reach, if giv'n to live till after-time:
And what a pyramid it might build &mdash; how fraught
With treasures, but from time and meditation caught.

Now &mdash; oh!  how short is life!  yet, in our day
Things like the sunbeams start from out the brain&mdash;
Man like a vapour shines &mdash; then sinks away;
Bright to the last, but brief &mdash; a thing of pain
And passion &mdash; slave of love, hate, pleasure, gain&mdash;
Fashion'd from all the elements, and frail
As each &mdash; all fire, clay, ether &mdash; like the main
Stormy, and fickle as the April gale&mdash;
He sins, prays, hates, forgives, then prays and &mdash; sins again.
