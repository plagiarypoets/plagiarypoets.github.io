Oft, when the weary, tedious day is o'er,
And night, once more, resumes her reign serene,
'Tis then, &mdash; retracing joys, alas!  no more,
I love to wander thro' the pensive scene!
'Tis then, by every prying eye unseen,
I oft indulge in dreams of past delight;
And, tho' I still may feel each pang more keen,
Yet, still I feel thy influence, &mdash; bless'd night!
And oft, while heavenly visions, pure and bright,
My every care can thus with hope console;
I long for that eternal, promis'd light,
When day shall break upon the christian's soul!
Oh!  when calm night can thus a peace restore,
I wish to sink in sleep, and wake no more!
