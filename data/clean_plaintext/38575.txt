Ye Britons, whom the lyric muse inspires,
Why do ye all Pindaric numbers try?
O tune to humbler strains your feeble lyres,
Nor on such lofty pinions strive to fly,
Lest, trembling with the height, ye giddy grow,
Fall headlong from the skies, and reach the depths below.

Pindar new ways and hidden paths explores,
By no harsh laws or critic rules confin'd;
Amidst th' aethereal plains he boldly soars,
Free as the wave, and lawless as the wind.
In jingling fetters bound, then, can we dare
To steer our course with him, and cleave the yielding air?

Yet would I not put out the lyric flame,
Or banish Clio from this favour'd isle;
But only point an easier way to fame,
More suited to our genius, and our stile;
Like those soft lays, which gay Anacreon sung,
Or such as sweetly flow'd from gentler Sappho's tongue.

Horace, the first of Rome's poetic train,
Who tun'd to Grecian sounds the Latin string,
Avoided still the bold Pindaric strain,
Content his odes in bounded verse to sing:
Yet, whilst his muse declin'd the arduous flight,
His genius urg'd her course beyond e'en Pindar's height.

Since then these numbers greater freedom ask,
Than this our chiming metre can supply,
Ye bards, forsake the too laborious task,
Nor on such feeble wings ascend so high:
But, whilst the Theban Eagle soars above,
Let us, amidst the vales, on humbler pinions move.

Pindar his nervous verses roll'd along,
As floods rush down some steepy mountain's side,
Whilst humbler runs our less aspiring song,
Like gentle streams which thro' the meadows glide:
Stronger than ours his mighty genius glows,
As fiercer than the brook the raging torrent flows.
