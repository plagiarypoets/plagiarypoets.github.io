Come, gentle truth, and lay his bosom bare,
No more shall slander now pursue the dead;
Here rests a bard from all his grief and care,
No horrid guilt disturbs his peaceful shade!

His fond desire it was like man to feel,
To ease the wretched, and relieve the poor!
If other's pain he saw, and could not heal,
He sigh'd &mdash; and what could pity's self do more!

Bless'd in his parents, each of temper kind,
No tyrant-nature in his bosom rag'd;
Yet kindling to oppose the' oppressive mind,
With such, undaunted, oft' he was engag'd!

Here lay his worth, if any worth he had,
And all his frailty was "the soft extreme;"
Blame him who can, with such a nature clad!
Christians beware &mdash; let Jews and Heathens blame.

If to one sect he shew'd peculiar love,
He kindly gave his hand to all the rest;
This was his chief concern, for this he strove,
That all in Jesu's Spirit might be bless'd!
