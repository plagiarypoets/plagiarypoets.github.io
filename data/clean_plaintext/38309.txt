What time late sate upon my closed eyes,
Endued by Jove with magic influence, Slumber;
Things strange my nimble Fancy did devise,
Whiles nought of earthly sense did it encumber;
Methought, that Queen of ever-honour'd name,
Philippa, 'fore mine eyes did pass confest;
Anon at modest-seeming distance came
An aged Form, yclad in priestly Vest;
His praying looks oftimes to Heav'n up-rear'd,
As oft upon a certain Scroll cast down,
Where goodly draught of sacred houses appear'd,
Eftsoons for grace and lore to win renown:
These follow'd were by num'rous gowned tribe,
Which, heav'nly Muse, me help most fittingly describe.

First, holy Dame Divinity did lead
A rev'rend band of Elders sable-clad;
All, as they walk'd, did ghostly bookes read
With greedy eyes and looks beseemly-sad;
(Aside stood Satan, and him Envy burn'd,
Sight hateful, sight tormenting did him gall;
His eyes with jealous leer askance he turn'd,
Whiles useless vengeance flash'd from either ball;)
Twain heav'nly Forms did hand in hand attend;
Zeal hight the one, the other Charity,
Of Truth the one, the other Mankind's friend;
The first did seem in holy Cause full bold
The last Good-will to all did in meek count'ance hold.

Next them a train of younger Clerkes came,
With num'rous Ladies, different in attire
But sisters all, and by one common name
Hight Sciences, ere while an ethnic choir;
But now did Guardian Angel them deduce
After that serious Dame Divinity,
Bringing unholy lore to holy use,
And Arts, else vainest, thus did sanctify:
(Then Satan's soul was suddenly replete
With Disappointment's anguish; having Creed
'Fore-entertain'd, that with vain deceit
Those ethnic Nymphs wou'd Christian Clerks mislead;)
All pass'd in decent rank and grave array,
Nor Poesy, most lewd, once wanton'd by the way.

Now had mine eyes with wond'ring Pleasance view'd
So fair a train, and cou'd for aye have gaz'd;
When, suddenly, they saw the same pursu'd
By motley crew of Clerkes seeming-craz'd:
Their Leader wore fantastic cap of fool,
Bedight each side with ear of braying beast,
******* yclept:  (him Satan found fit tool
To work despight unto that holy Priest)
Onward he led his prick-ear'd crew, and gall'd
The heels of sober Clerkes gone before:
At so unworthy sight I stood appall'd,
And all indignant this last Vision bore:&mdash;
Thus, after courtly process of the Great,
The looker's grieved eye doth Mob unsightly meet.
