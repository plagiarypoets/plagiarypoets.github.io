CANTO I.
Fell Jaghernaut, along thy guilty land
Streams many a crimson tide:  o'er every spot
Hath blood-nursed Havoc laid his red right hand,
And bared his victims in the air to rot.
No tearful eye is seen; &mdash; by all forgot,
Save Nature's winged murderers, unbleached bones
Lie houseless; &mdash; "dust to dust" was chaunted not,
Nor solemn anthem rolled its angel tones,
But Superstition clanks her chain, and madly moans.

Yet here balm gushes from each wildwood tree,
Sabaean sweets the airs of heaven exhale;
The rich banana waves her foliage free,
And flings her incense on Orissa's gale.
Who would not deem, that soft should be the tale
Of such soft scenes?  that blue-eyed Innocence,
Like rose-bud scenting Sharon's odorous vale,
Should o'er these realms her sweetest charms dispense,
And not a dark cloud dim the paradise of sense.

Yet dark the purport of that living mass,
Which hurries on, like surges of the sea:
And not a heart of them, who proudly pass,
But triumphs at the thought of death to be.
Their blossom, sheathed in iron apathy,
With prescient ardour hopes the passive prey:
Expectance paints the murderous revelry,
While words of cheer deceive the distant way,
And every eye for Jaghernaut beams bright and gay.

Gay is the marching of that locust band,
Bright the Sun dances on their varied dress:
And, &mdash; but that Murder waves her crimson wand,&mdash;
The eye might revel in such loveliness.
Men, Women, Babes, in mingled columns press,
And send a shout of joy, if joy be there
Where human victims, in accurst excess
Of wild enthusiasm, murmur forth a prayer,
And dash themselves to earth with many a frantic air.

Hushed now those babel sounds, and all is still,
Like the low prelude to the louring storm;
Then bursts again the deep, tumultuous thrill
Of paynim exultation: &mdash; rapture warm
Swells the loud cry to greet their temple's form.
Again, again; &mdash; "'Tis there &mdash; the hallowed fane,
The shrine of all our hopes, &mdash; the beacon charm,
Which led our pilgrim steps o'er many a plain;&mdash;
We greet our temple, and adore our God again."

Seemed as the burst of music, but the sound
Hath softened into lowest harmony:
Seems as the reeds, which Zephyr waves around,
Making them vocal &mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Why fades the lustre of that eagle eye?
Why sinks the grandeur of that high-arched brow?
&mdash;One drop of water, ere the victim die,
Ere fled the sense of agony below.
Had he not deemed, ere Nature's mortal throe
Convulsed his shivering frame, to bow the knee
At Jaghernaut's high shrine? &mdash; but there is woe,
Which e'en of Jaghernaut no proud decree
Can cancel, or reprieve the wretch from misery.

Where is his wild-cane cot?  and where the trees
His hand had planted in the morn of life?
Where the wild bower, that caught the evening breeze,
Graced by the presence of a bosom wife?
How blest the spot, where 'erst in rapture rife,
He sucked the lusciousness of love, when Heaven
Had snatched  him from a land of strife,
From blood-stained Gallia's land, and she was given,
The fairest of the fair, the spotless without leaven.

Young hearts, I ween, will tremble at the tale,
Young hearts, embalmed in  ecstasy of love:
And tears will fall, and loud will be the wail
O'er those, who hasten to a world above.
Yes &mdash; when the bud was blushing, to remove
The nectar gem from hands, that feebly held
The dear delicious boon; &mdash; oh!  who could prove
Such cutting cruelty with tears repelled,
The chrystal fount of sympathy and feeling quelled!

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
