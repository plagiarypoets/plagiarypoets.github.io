What dreary prospects meets the eye,
How dismal howls the western wind,
What storms deface the azure sky,
And ah!  what terrors seize the mind.
Say, to illume this gloomy scene,
Will no kind power its aid impart?
Yes, Hope, she comes sweet soothing queen:
See through the shades her radiance dart,
And pours a balsam on the drooping heart.

She in smiling future shows
Vernal meads and valleys gay,
Where the modest violet blows,
And laughing Nature gives the May,
And Summer's blythsome dewy eve,
When careless to the grove we stray,
Where jas'mines, woodbines, interweave,
While Eglantine syringas gay,
And fragrance-breathing roses strew the way.

Sweet Hope, whose magic o'er the soul,
Alike the king and peasant find,
All join to bless thy soft controul,
Thou first best friend of human kind;
Chas'd by thy smiles flies Care and Pain,
And pining Love and black Despair,
The rosy cherubs of thy train
Are Pleasure, Joy, and Fancy fair,
And jocund Mirth, sweet antidote to Care.

I woo the goddess to my heart,
Oh deign to be a constant guest,
Thy gentle soothing smiles impart,
Throw by the light fantastic dress,
Thy glowing tints shall paint each scene
That on life's toilsome stage appears,
Thy magic glass shall intervene,
And shield me from low thoughted cares,
Till all my days, my hours, thy livery wears.
