Oh!  for the time &mdash; the happy sinless time
When first we murmured forth our infant prayer,
Listened with reverence to the church bell's chime&mdash;
Gazed on the sky and deemed that God dwelt there!
That time is past &mdash; burdened with sin and care
No more we hear those holy deep-toned bells;
But as their echo trembles on the air
So in our sorrowing minds Remembrance dwells,
Rising reproachful from the deepest cells&mdash;
Breathing of those fine days ere passion's sigh
Remorse and sorrow, (and the tale she tells,)
Polluted the petition sent on high;&mdash;
When we knelt sinless &mdash; and our God alone
Was in the prayer that rose to his Almighty throne.
