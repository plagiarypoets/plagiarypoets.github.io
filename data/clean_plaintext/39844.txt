'Twas morning and Mary arose,
Her stockings and garters put on;
Instinctively follow'd her nose,
And walk'd with her back to the Sun.

She smil'd and the woods were illum'd,
She sigh'd and the vales were depress'd;
She breath'd and the air was perfum'd,
She frown'd and saw nature distress'd.

She nodded &mdash; the tree nodded too,
She murmur'd, and so did the rill,
She wept, and the evening dew&mdash;
Fell in tears on the neighbouring hill.

She stept and fair flow'rs sprang up,
She blush'd and the rose look'd more red,
She was hungry &mdash; she went home and supt,
She was tired, and so &mdash; went to bed.
