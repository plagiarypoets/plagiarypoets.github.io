I.
O list, fair ladye!  while I tell
Of visions rais'd by magic spell;
And gentle were the sprites that shed
Their influence o'er my slumbering head;
Was waking mortal ne'er so blest&mdash;
Then lovely Eyra, "list, O list!"&mdash;
&mdash;Methought a nymph of heavenly mien,
Whose garb bespoke the Fairy Queen,
Sudden appear'd &mdash; and with a smile
Might well the wariest heart beguile,
Wav'd thrice on high her magic wand,
And beckon'd me to Fairyland:&mdash;
Who could resist the charming Elf?
She seem'd the while thy lovely self!

II
Then seated in her silver car,
We lightly flew o'er realms afar,
Where rocky mountains bleak arose,
With Alpine lakes and endless snows;
Or sandy desarts scorch'd and dun,
Stretch'd boundless 'neath a fiery sun.&mdash;
&mdash;Her fair hand guides the magic rein,
While merrily o'er mount and plain,
And over Ocean's trackless tides,
Our swift car like a comet glides;
Till Phoebus in the western wave
Sought sea-born Thetis' coral cave;
And Hesper o'er the slumbering deep
Arose his silent watch to keep.

III.
At length we reach her lonely grot
Plac'd in enchanted isle remote;
Where mountains rear their summits bold
From sombre shade of forests old;
And streamlets flow with lulling sound
Through shelter'd vallies opening round;
And vines and breathing myrtles spread
Their verdant canopy o'erhead;
And zephyrs curl with sportive wing
The silken tresses of the spring.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

V.
The sun had sunk &mdash; but his steps of light
Might yet be traced in the western sky,
Where the moveless clouds of amber bright,
In soft confusion lye;
And the eye might picture isles of bliss
In these azure deeps reposing,
All silent and serene as this
Round which the night was closing&mdash;
&mdash;And, oh, how sweet in this lovely isle
It seem'd, to live alone with Thee,
Where summer skies for ever smile,
And sighing gales just stir the sea;
Where the murmuring tide so meekly laves,
The sandy beach and shelving caves;
And happy genii seem to dwell
Along each cliff-embattled dell&mdash;
How sweet through fairy glades to walk
With thee in softly "whisper'd talk,"
What time the hermit nightingale
Awakes the mazy moonlight vale;
Or from the mountain's cliffy steep
View circling oceans round us swelling,
Without a wish to cross the deep,
Or leave our lone and lovely dwelling!&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
