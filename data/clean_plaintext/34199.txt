Once more the vernal sun's all-chearing beams 
The fields, as with a purple robe, adorn: 
Thy bloomy banks, O CAM, and glist'ring streams 
All laugh and sing at mild approach of morn; 
Thro' the deep groves I hear the chaunting birds, 
And thro' the clover'd vale the various-lowing herds.

Up mounts the mower from his lowly thatch, 
Well pleas'd the progress of the spring to mark, 
The fragrant breath of breezes pure to catch, 
And startle from her couch the early lark; 
More genuine pleasure soothes his tranquil breast, 
Than high-thron'd kings can boast, in eastern glory drest.

The pensive poet thro' the green-wood steals, 
Or treads the willow'd marge of murmuring brook; 
Or climbs the steep ascent of airy hills; 
There sits him down beneath a branching oak, 
Whence various scenes, and prospects wide below, 
Still teach his musing mind with fancies high to glow.

But I nor with the day awake to bliss, 
(Inelegant to me fair nature's face, 
A blank the beauty of the morning is, 
And dreary darkness for all for light and grace) 
Nor bright the sun, nor green the meads appear, 
Nor colour charms mine eye, nor melody mine ear.

Me, void of elegance and manners mild, 
With leaden rod stern Discipline restrains; 
Stiff Pedantry, of learned Pride the child, 
My roving genius binds in Gothic chains; 
Nor more my Muse, by weight of woes opprest,
Can whisper to my soul sweet songs of peace and rest.
