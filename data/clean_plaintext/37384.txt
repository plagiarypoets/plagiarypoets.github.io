Stay, blessed ray of memory, stay,
Thou ling'ring beam of raptures day;
O!  stay thy wild enchanting smile,
Dear memory do, and rest awhile;
Where sleep thy long forsaken roses,
Whose ev'ry shrinking leaf exposes
Some blighted love, who there reposes.
Yet &mdash; yet &mdash; each little pulse is throbbing,
Each dying eye-beam yet would meet thee,
Each shakes his rainbow wing, and sobbing,&mdash;
Puts up his little lip to greet thee.

Rapt expectation lifts her flowers,
To catch your smile, ye coming hours!
And hope escapes, all wild and free,
And hangs around fu-tu-ri-ty.
Her dancing garlands rich and bright,
Her wreathes of visionary light,
Of woven sunshine snatch'd from thee,
Cold &mdash; heartless &mdash; star-eyed mem-o-ry!
All nature wakes with love and glee,
And promises &mdash; fe-li-ci-ty.

&mdash;

Come dreamer! &mdash; clad in mimick light,
Wear robes of azure dropp'd with light,
Like beams on ocean's breast,
When starry tears bestrew the main,
And liquid lustre lights that plain,
Where silence holds her breathless reign,
While day-light sinks to rest.
When far beneath the wave we see
That cool &mdash; that deep tran-quil-li-ty,
Which none but wa'try mirrors show,
When not a ripple shakes the glow
Of fancy's sleeping world below.
When ev'ry drooping breeze that sweeps,
Its vapoury plume across it &mdash; weeps;
Ah!  then what glorious sights ye see!
What busy flashing wars awake!
Thy steady worlds &mdash; e-ter-ni-ty
Their everlasting orbits break&mdash;
And rise &mdash; and struggle &mdash; and subside,
Thus shaken in reflections tide.

&mdash;

Oh!  mem'ry, I remember well,
When frolick tun'd her flutt'ring shell,
And wak'd my boyhood's lips to try
The icy kiss of ap-a-thy:
I met that kiss, its chill has gone,
But I am desolate &mdash; alone.
'Twas midnight, all the winds were hush'd.
The tempest's startled wing had rush'd,
In clouds across the sky;
Hope toss'd her plumes, and kindly brush'd
The tear that to my eye-lid rush'd;
My love herself was nigh.
Oh!  memory, what a night was there&mdash;
'Twas cold and still &mdash; but bright and fair;
A spirit sat beside me.

&mdash;

An angel form that seem'd to say
"With thee forever I will stay,
Whatever may betide thee."
'Twas such a lovely night as this,
But colder far, and brighter,
Our lips first met &mdash; that icy bliss&mdash;
'Twas like the north wind's hasty kiss,
But quicker &mdash; keener &mdash; lighter.
Away, distracting visions!  leave me&mdash;
Such pictures &mdash; ah, they only grieve me.

&mdash;

And yet one moment memory stay,
And smile again that misty ray
That sadden'd last upon my sight&mdash;
That wat'ry lustre shining cold,
And chill, and faint, hath often told
My mounting heart &mdash; that all thy light
Was but the cheerless beam of night.

&mdash;

My web of life seem'd once of flame,
So thick were starry joys strew'd o'er it;
But with'ring disappointment came
And stole the glowing robe, and wore it;
She sprinkled o'er its texture, care,
And clouds and woe &mdash; and scatter'd there,
The doubtful shadows of despair.
Yet still &mdash; thou dear bewitching dream!
The bright spots flash'd a brighter gleam&mdash;
And hopes, that seem'd but joys in light,
Seem'd extacies amid that that night&mdash;
No more, dear memory &mdash; it is strange,
That thou should'st lead me such a range.
I felt the beam of thy bright eye
Falling so soft, so &mdash; si-lent-ly,
It seem'd like inspiration's spark&mdash;
'Tis gone &mdash; it perish'd in the dark,
And only leaves a deeper gloom,
Like flint-fire waken'd in a tomb,
Could this be fleeting mem'ries glance,
That led my heart this wild'ring dance?
It flash'd across my lonely breast,
A beam on ice &mdash; it froze to rest.
I thought some little warmth I felt,
But 'twas not vital &mdash; could not melt,
'Twas like that cold, unlovely beam
That lights some wintry mountain stream,
That shines across the trav'llers way,
And smiles to lure his feet astray.
Its glow but flash'd &mdash; a feverish light
To settle in a deeper night.
Like the warm hectic of the skies,
That blushes &mdash; burns &mdash; and faints &mdash; and dies.
