But for the cloud, were neither shower nor bow;
The loveliness that Earth and Sky display:
'Tis when the storm descends, and tempests blow,
The traveller seeks the refuge on his way;
The first fair moment of the break of day,
Had never been, but for the gloom of night;
The Spring's sweet time of hope and blossoms gay,
Owes half its sweetness to the Winter's blight:
Such is the brilliance and extreme delight
Of the first dawn of joy, when grief departs;
And through the night of sorrow glances bright
A beam of heavenly love upon our hearts;
So, through the cloud of woe, and falling tears,
Serenely bright the world of day appears.
