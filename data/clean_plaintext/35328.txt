Ye spiry turrets!  ye embattled walls!
On which destroying Time full-long hath frown'd,
While on your dusky crest the moon-beam falls,
Pensive I stray your mournful splendours round;
And, oft awaken'd from musing, list the sound
Of the far distant bell, or the shrill tone
That breaks from yon dark grove, with vapours crown'd,
Where, while the  breezes mid the foliage moan,
Deep bosom'd sits, and shrieks, the owlet lone.
Dear to my bosom, pierc'd by many a wound,
Thou mouldering pile, is thy congenial gloom!
For here may I indulge in thought profound,
Mourn Joys that perish'd ere their perfect bloom,
And sigh for that repose which dwells but in the tomb.
