Many invoke pale Hesper's pensive sway,
When rest supine leans o'er the pillowing clouds,
And the last tinklings come
From the safe folded flock.

But me, bright harbinger of coming day,
Who shone the first on the primaeval morn;
Me, thou delightest more&mdash;
Chastely luxuriant.

Let the poor silken sons of slothful pride
Press now their downy couch in languid ease,
While visions of dismay
Flit o'er their troubled brain.

Be mine to view; awake to nature's charms,
Thy paly flame evanish from the sky,
As gradual day usurps
The welkin's glowing bounds.

Mine, to snuff up the pure ambrosial breeze,
Which bears aloft the rose-bound car of morn,
And mark his early flight
The rustling skylark wing.

And thou, Hygeia, shalt my steps attend,
Thou, whom distracted, I so lately wooed,
As on my restless bed
Slow past the tedious night;

And slowly, by the taper's sickly gleam
Drew my dull curtain; and with anxious eye
Strove, through the veil of night
To mark the tardy morn.

Thou, Health, shalt bless me in my early walk,
As o'er the upland slope I brush the dew,
And feel the genial thrill
Dance in my lighten'd veins.

And as I mark the Cotter from his shed
Peep out with jocund face &mdash; thou, too, Content,
Shalt steal into my breast,
Thy mild, thy placid sway.

Star of the morning!  these, thy joys I'll share,
As rove my pilgrim feet the sylvan haunts;
While to thy blushing shrine
Due orisons shall rise.
