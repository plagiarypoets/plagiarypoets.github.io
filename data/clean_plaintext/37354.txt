If aught of lowly voice, or warbling flute,
May dare, sweet Eve!  to charm thy pensive soul,
Like thy celestial sounds,
And soft dissolving airs,
O maid serene!  while now the crescent fair
Smiles on yon bashful youth, whose glowing mail
Still throws its varied beams
Along the western sky:
Now Silence breathes, save where the thrifty bee,
Homeward returning, stirs the perfum'd air,
Or when the chafer tunes
His rude sonorous song;
As oft he does amidst the solemn pause,
To sooth the ear of some romantic Bard:
Instruct me how to weave
The sweet harmonious song,
Whose cadence, dying on the murm'ring stream,
May add a two-fold softness to its plaint,
As, pondering here, I pay
My homage to thy charms!
For, when the fav'rite star serenely gleams,
In azure vest of purest ether clad,
The am'rous couples meet,
Who mourn'd the tedious day;
And many a weary soul, with sorrow full,
Adores thy holy calm; and, musing deep,
The vestal thought devout
Lies prostrate at thy shrine.
Then guide me, Spirit!  where the rolling main
Scarce beats the mould'ring basis of the shore;
Or thro' th' umbrageous wood
Where Solitude sojourns.
But, when the vaulted skies, for many a league,
The lightnings sever and the thunders shake,
Conduct my burning feet
To rude St. Gothard's height,
Where I may sit to view the winged storm,
To hear the Genius of the Mountain's moan,
The whirlwind's hollow blast,
And Nature's ling'ring sigh!
While Heav'n's bright radiance lights my boyish eyes,
And, from the precincts of celestial realms,
Sublime, seraphic tones
Exalt my bursting soul:
While clouds above, an overwhelming mass
Of various matter, drink the briny lake,
And suns with cheerful rays
Invigorate the earth;
So long, thou lovely Nymph!  beneath thy shades,
Shall Genius, Fancy, and th' Aonian maids
Thy hallow'd charms explore,
And celebrate thy name!
