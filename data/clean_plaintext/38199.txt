Come, Saint-eyed Health, whose open brow,
Is crown'd with Pleasure's vivid blooms;
Now with thy glowing hopes, thy wishes warm,
Inspire thy suppliant's soul.

Thy eye of fire, and almost tyrian blush,
Give to the cheek of happy joy;
Mine be thy meekest look, oh Goddess, mine
Are unaspiring prayers.

Now on my withering cheek,
The damp dead pale of sickness hangs;
And in my sinking eye
Life's lingering lustre plays.

Ah give me back the bosom's calm delight,
Haste, still the throbbing nerve, the aching beat;
Cool my hot lip, and fan my scorching breast
With mild Hygeian breeze.

Alternate, Agony, intense, severe,
And dull-eyed languour on my features now;
Their fearful changes strike,
And writhe my tortur'd frame.

The sullen swinging bell &mdash; the sigh of love,
Alike disturb my brain, it starts to fire&mdash;
And now my faint sick heart
Scarce feels the pulse of life.

Restore the chearful eye, the breathing bloom,
The lip of rosy tint, the easy smile;
The healthful mind that feels in every scene
The genuine thrill of joy.
