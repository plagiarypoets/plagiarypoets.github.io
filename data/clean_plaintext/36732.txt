Ken ye auld Eddie o' the ferny howe?
A wrinkled wife o' fourscore years an' twa;
Eild's winter cauld, hath clad her palsied pow
Wi' locks as white as wreaths o' drifted snaw:
The fouk around, a witch will Eddie ca'&mdash;
She's far frae chancie a' the neebors, say,
For she can steal the yellow prize awa',
(While lassies vainly sweat the lee lang day),
An' smite the stirks an' sheep wi' mony a sickly wae.
