THE ARGUMENT.
Here Corydon proves,
That nothing can be sent,
To crosse love more,
Then friends unkind restraint.

THE SECOND ARGUMENT.
Corydon coy Celia woes,
And his love by tokens showes.
Tokens are those lures, that find
Best accesse to woman kind.
Long he woes ere he can win;
Yet at last she fancieth him:
And so firme, as you shall heare,
Each to other troth-plight were;
But alas, where love is most,
There it oft-times most is crost.
For these two are closly pent,
Each from other by restraint;
He, unto the plaine must go,
Love-sicke, heart-sicke, full of wo,
Where he sings such chearefull layes,
In his chast choise, Celias praise,
That steepe mountaines, rocks and plaines,
Seeme entranced with his straines:
But alas, while he does keepe,
Helplesse shepheard, haplesse sheepe,
Celia for to seeke her make,
From her keeper makes escape,
And unto the mountaine goes,
Where her selfe, her selfe doth lose;
While one of Laverna'es crew,
Seizeth on her as his dew,
Where by force, by awe, by feare,
She was long detained there,
And in the end affianc'd so,
As she ends her life in wo.

THE SHEPHEARDS.
Technis.  Dymnus.  Dorycles.
Corydon.  Sapphus.  Linus.

Nay shepheards stay, there is no hast but good,
We three are shepheards, and have understood
Both of your follies and your fancies too;

DORYCLES.
Why tell us Corydon, what thou wouldst do!

CORYDON.
Shew my misfortune Swaines, as you have done,

TECHNIS.
Deferre it till to morrow Corydon.

CORYDON.
No, Technis no, I cannot if I would,
You've told your griefes, and now mine must be told:
What though the Sunne be drawing to the West,
Where he intends to take his wonted rest,
Tis Moone-light (lads) and if it were not light,
Welcome you are to lodge with me all night.

DORYCLES.
Thankes Corydon.

CORYDON.
Why thanke you Corydon?
Simple and meane's the cottage where I won,
Yet well I wot, for chestnuts, cakes, and creame,
If you'le accept my welcome as I meane,
You shall not want, but have sufficient store,
With hearty welcome swaines, what would ye more?

DYMNUS.
More Corydon!  t'is all that we can wish,
But to thy tale, let's heare now what it is.

DORYCLES.
Yes, do good Corydon; and we will stay;

CORYDON.
Attend then shepheards, heare what I shall say,

SAPPHUS.
And when you've done, I will begin with mine;

LINUS.
Which I'le continue in the evening time.

CORYDON.
Well said, good shepheards, we are justly three,
To answer their three tales, and here for me.
There was a Maid, and well might she be said,
So chast, so choice she was, to be a Maid,
Where lillie white mixt with a cherrie red,
Such admiration in the shepheards bred,
As well was he that might but have a sight
Of her rare beauty mirror of delight.
Oft would she come unto a silver spring,
Which neare her fathers house was neighboring,
Where she would eye her selfe as she did passe,
For shepheards use no other looking-glasse.

TECHNIS.
True Corydon.

CORYDON.
But which may seeme more rare,
This Maid she was as wise as she was faire;
So as discretion did so moderate
The safe condition of her low estate,
As envie never wrong'd her spotlesse name,
Or soild her matchlesse honour with defame.

DORYCLES.
Under a happie Planet she was borne,

CORYDON.
She was indeed; nor did she ever scorne,
The company of any country maid,
How meane soere or sluttishly araid:
But she would be their play-fare, to make chuse,
Of such poore simple sports as wenches use.
Yea in their wakes, shroves, wassel-cups, or tides,
Or Whitson-ales, or where the country brides
Chuse out-their bride-maids, as the custome is,
She seld or neare was seene to do amisse:
But so respective of her name and fame,
That though she blusht, she never blusht for shame
Of any act immodest, but retain'd
That good opinion which her vertues gain'd.

DYMNUS.
Sure Corydon this was a Saintly woman;

CORYDON.
Indeed such Saints 'mongst women are not common:
But to my story; her did many swaine,
By fruitlesse suite endevour to obtaine,
As young Spudippus, rich Archymorus,
Active Amintas, youthfull Hirsius.

DORYCLES.
It seemes sh'ad choice.

CORYDON.
Yes, Dorycles, she had:
And some of these were good, and some as bad,
But neither good nor bad, nor rich nor poore,
Could her content, though she had daily store.
Yet from Pandoras box did nere proceed,
More hatefull poyson upon humane seed,
Then from these forlorne lovers, whose report,
(But just is heaven, for they were plagued for't,)
Aspers'd this scandall on faire Celia,
That she had made her choice some other way.

TECHNIS.
Unworthy lovers.

CORYDON.
True indeed, they be
Unworthy th' love of such an one as she;
For Linus you do know them;

LINUS.
Yes, I do,
But specially Spudippus, whom I know,
To be the notedst cot-queane that's about him.

TECHNIS.
Sure Linus the she could not chuse but flout him.

CORYDON.
Perhaps she did, yet with that modestie,
As she did shadow it so covertly,
That he could scarce discover what she ment.

LINUS.
How ere Spudippus would be patient.

DORYCLES.
Then he's some gull.

LINUS.
No he's a wealthy man,
And such an one as rightly, sure I am,
Knows how much milke crummock his cow will give,
And can discerne a riddle from a sive.

CORYDON.
Linus, it seemes thou knowes him passing well.

LINUS.
Las if I would, some stories I could tell,
Would make you laugh:  for as it chanc'd one day,
Some with my selfe did take his house by th' way,
Where we an houre or two meant to remaine,
To trie how he his friends would entertaine.

DORYCLES.
And pray thee how?

LINUS.
I'le tell thee Dorycles:
Having an houre or two taken our ease,
And readie to depart (I pray thee heare)
He sent one of his Sculletie for some beare,
Which though long first, came in an earthen cup,
Which being given to me, I drunke it up;
Which drunke.

CORYDON.
How then good Linus, pray thee say?

LINUS.
The rest were forc'd to go a thirst away.

DORYCLES.
Had he no more?

CORYDON.
Thou us'd him in his kind.

LINUS.
May all be used so that have his mind.
But much I feare me, I'ue disturbed thee,
Now Corydon shew what th' event may be!

CORYDON.
Long did these woe, but Celia could approve
Of nothing lesse then of these swainlings love,
Yet would she faine to fancie one of these,
Whereby she might her bedrid father please.

TECHNIS.
Had she a father?

CORYDON.
Yes, a surly Lout,

Who long had laine decrepit with the gout,
And liv'd for all the world, and so did die
Like to a hog, that's pent up in a stie.

DORYCLES.
Some cancred erwig.

CORYDON.
True, a very elfe,
Who car'd not who starv'd, so he fed himselfe.
He, as the want of one sense is exprest,
By giving more perfection to the rest,
For even his sense of feeling did decline,
Though he had bene a nigglar in his time,
Yea all those moving, active faculties,
Which in the heate of youth are wont to rise,
Gave way unto suspition, lest his daughter
Through those love-luring gifts which many brought her,
Should set her Maiden honor at whole sale.

TECHNIS.
Age h'as an eare indeed for every tale.

CORYDON.
True, Technis true, for no affection can
Have more predominance ore any man,
Then jealousie a selfe-consuming rage,
Is said to have ore men of doting age.

DORYCLES.
Thy reason Corydon?

CORYDON.
That disesteeme
Of being now more weake then they have bene,
Makes them repine at others now that may,
And are as able to beget as they.

TECHNIS.
Tis rightly noted Corydon.

LINUS.
Yes, he
Knowes by observance whence these humors be.

CORYDON.
Linus I do, and better had I bene,
If I had never knowne what these things meane;
But shepheards you shall heare the reason, why
I should this Dotards humour thus descrie.

SAPPHUS.
Yes, do good Swaine.

CORYDON.
It chanc'd upon a night,
A Moone-light night, when Moone and starres shine bright,
That I with other shepheards did repaire
To th' old-mans house, and found faire Celia there,
Whom I in curisie with a kind salute,
Kist, and with speaking heart though tongue was mute,
Wish'd; O what wishes do possesse a mind,
That dare not utter how his heart's inclind!
She might be mine, thrice blest in being mine.

DORYCLES.
Why didst not woe her Swaine, for to be thine?

CORYDON.
Yes, Dorycles I woed her, though not then,
For Maidens they are bashfull amongst men,
And dare we not well in modestie impart,
What they could give consent to with their heart;
So as to tell thee, truly Dorycles,
We past that night in making purposes,
Singing of catches, with such knowne delights,
As young folke use to passe ore winter nights.
And at that time, I may be bold to tell thee,
For such conceits I thought none could excell me.
For well you know, I was in Hyble bred,
And by the sacred sisters nourished,
So as being stor'd by Nature, help'd by art,
There was no straine I bore not in some part:
Which gave faire Celia such entire content,
As she discoverd after, what she ment.
Though I may sweare, for five months I came to her,
And with some termes of art assaid to woe her:
During which time, all th' answer I could get,
Was this; she did not meane to marrie yet.

TECHNIS.
That's all the answer these young women have,
While they reject what after they receive.

CORYDON.
Technis, indeed I did perceive as much,
Though all young wenches humours be not such:
But th' greatest cause of Celias distaste,
Which made me many times the lesser grac't,
Proceeded from that chrone her dogged father,
As after by conjectures I did gather:
Perswading her, that she should plant her love
On such whose hopefull meanes might best approve
Her discreet choice:  and that was not to be
Affianced to such an one as me.

DORYCLES.
Alas poore Swaine; 'tis true what th' Proverbe saith,
We aske not what he is, but what he hath.

CORYDON.
And yet perswasions which her father us'd,
Could not prevaile with her, for she had chus'd,
In heart I meane.

TECHNIS.
Whom did she dote upon?

CORYDON.
Will ye beleeve me!

TECHNIS.
Yes.

CORYDON.
Twas Corydon.

LINUS.
Thrice happie swaine.

CORYDON.
Thrice happie had I bene,
If I had slept still in this golden dreame;
But afterwards occurrences there were,
Which thus abridg'd my hopes, as you shall heare.
Such deepe impression had affection made,
As there remained nothing unassaid,
To consummate our wishes, but the rite.

TECHNIS.
Yes something else.

CORYDON.
What Technis!

TECHNIS.
Marriage night.

SAPPHUS.
They had enjoyed that, you may suppose.

CORYDON.
No, Sapphus no, she was not one of those:
So modest, chast, respective of her name,
Pure and demure, as th' sweetnesse of her fame,
Above the choisest odors that are sent
From spicie Tmolus flowrie continent,
Sent forth that fragrant and delightfull savour,
As none ere heard, and did not seeke to have her.
For sundrie choise discourses have we had,
And I nere knew that ought could make her glad,
Which had least taste of lightnesse.

TECHNIS.
Sure thou art,
So much thy praises relish true desert,
Worthy such vertuous beautie.

CORYDON.
Technis no,
Albeit Celia esteem'd me so,
As long and tedious seem'd that day to be,
Which did devide her from my companie.
So as in silent groves and shady launes,
Where Silvans, water-nimphs, fairies, and faunes,
Use to frequent, there would we sit and sing,
Eying our beauties in a neighbour spring,
Whose silver streamlings with soft murmring noise,
To make our consort perfect, gave their voice.
And long did we observe this custome too,
Though her consent did bid me ceasse to woe:
For now I was no woer, but her love,
And that so firmely linkt, as nought could move,
Alter or sunder our united hearts,
But meagre death, which all true lovers parts.

TECHNIS.
Then Corydon, to me it doth appeare,
That you were troth-plight.

CORYDON.
Technis so we were.
But see (good shepheards) what succeeded hence:
This love she bore me did her sire incense,
So as discurteously he pent his daughter
In such a vault, I could not see her after.
Which when my friends perceiv'd, they grieved were,
That th' love which I his Celia did beare,
Should be rewarded with contempt and scorne,
Being for parentage equally borne,
With best of his, as most of you can tell.

LINUS.
Proceed good Corydon, we know it well.

CORYDON.
For was I not of Polyarchus line,
A noble shepheard!

SAPPHUS.
True, who in his time
Solemniz'd many wakes on this our downe,
And ere he dide was to that honour growne,
As all our plaines resounded with his laies,
Sung by our Swaines in Polyarchus praise.

CORYDON.
It seemes thou knew him Sapphus:  but attend
For now my storie draweth neare an end.
My friends distasting this repulse of mine,
Forc'd me from th' course whereto I did incline:
So as my hopes confin'd, I'me driven to go
From Adons vale unto a mount of wo.

LINUS.
Unhappie shepheard.

CORYDON.
And unhappie sheepe,
For ill could I my heards from worrying keepe,
Though to that charge my friends enjoyned me,
When I could scarcely keepe my owne hands free,
From doing violence upon my selfe:
So as one day upon a ragged shelfe,
Wreath'd round with Ivie, as I sate alone,
Descanting Odes of sorrow and of mone,

I chanc'd on my mishap to meditate,
Celias restraint, and my forlorne estate;
Which done, I vow'd if speedy remedy
Gave no reliefe unto my maladie,
That very cliff where I repos'd that day,
Should be the meanes to take my life away.

TECHNIS.
O Corydon this soundeth of despaire.

CORYDON.
It does indeed:  but such a watchfull care,
Had gracious Pan of me, that in short time,
These motives to despaire 'gan to decline,
And lose their force:  so as when griefes grew ripe,
I us'd to take me to my oaten pipe.

DORYCLES.
But ere thou proceed further, tell us Swaine,
Where all this time thou used to remaine.

CORYDON.
Abroad-spread oake with aged armes and old,
Directs the passenger the way he would,
Neare Cadmus rising hillocks, where the spring
Of golden Tagus useth oft to bring
Such precious trafficke to the neighbour shore,
As former times through blindnesse did adore
Those curled streames, wherein they did descry
Their love to gold, by their Idolatrie:
That shady oake I say, and that blest spring,
In my distresse, gave me such harboring;
As night and day I did not thence remove,
But waking mus'd, and sleeping dream'd of love.

TECHNIS.
Who ever heard the like!

DORYCLES.
How didst thou live?

CORYDON.
On hope.

TECHNIS.
Weake food.

CORYDON.
Yet did it comfort give,
To my afflicted mind, which did desire,
Ever to singe her wings in fancies fire.
For many weekes in this distrest estate,
Wretched, forlorne, helplesse and desolate,
Sate I deiected, musing on despaire,
And when those drerie clouds would once grow faire:
But las the more I did expect reliefe,
The lesse hope had I to allay my griefe,
So as in th' end, as you shall after heare,
All meanes for my redresse abridged were.
But that you may perceive what love can do,
And how effectually her passions show,
I who before I lovely Celia kent,
Knew not what th' Heliconian Muses ment,
Addrest my selfe;

LINUS.
To what good Corydon?

CORYDON.
To write of love, and thus my Muse begun.

TECHNIS.
Pray thee kind Swaine let's heare what thou didst write.

DORYCLES.
Yes do:  for well I know it will delight
Shepheards to heare, of shepheards amorous toyes;

SAPPHUS.
On then good Corydon.

CORYDON.
Have at ye Boyes.

Celia speake, or I am dombe,
Here I'le sojorne till thou come,
Seeke I will till I grow blind,
Till I may my Celia find.
For if tongue-tide, string would breake,
If I heard but Celia speake;
And if blind, I soone should see,
Had I but a sight of thee;
Or if lame, love would find feete,
Might I once with Celia meete;
Or if deafe, should I but heare
Loves sweete accents from thy eare:
Thy choice notes would me restore,
That I should be deafe no more.
Thus though dombe, blind, deafe, and lame,
Heard I but my Celias name,
I should speake, see, heare, and go,
Vowing, Celia made me so.

TECHNIS.
Beshrow me Corydon, if I had thought,
That love such strange effects could ere have wrought.

CORYDON.
Yes Technis, yes, love's such a wondrous thing,
That it will make one plungd in sorrow sing,
And singing weepe, for griefe is wont to borrow
Some strains of joy, that joy might end in sorrow.
For what is woe (as we must needs confesse it)
Having both tongue and teares for to expresse it,
But a beguiling griefe, whose nature's such,
It can forget, lest it should grieve too much.

DORYCLES.
Indeed such sorrow seldome lasteth long,
But say good Swaine, heard Celia of thy song?

CORYDON.
I know not, Dorycles:  but twas her lot,
That from her keeper afterwards she got.

TECHNIS.
Happie escape.

CORYDON.
Ah Technis, say not so,
For this escape gave new increase to wo;

LINUS.
How could that be?

CORYDON.
Heare but what did ensue,
She was prevented by a ruffin-crue,
As she upon the mountaines rom'd about,
Through desart caves to find her shepheard out.

TECHNIS.
Alas poore wench; what were they Corydon?

CORYDON.
Such as did haunt there, and did live upon
Rapine and violence, triumphing in
Impunitie, sole motive unto sin.
In briefe, they were, for so they did professe,
Of brave Laverna'es crue, that patronesse
Of all disorder, and each evening time
Offer'd stolne booties to her godlesse shrine.

TECHNIS.
Mishap above mishaps.

CORYDON.
True, so it was;
My lasse she lost her lad, the lad his lasse.
And sundry daies, this rout did her detaine,
While haplesse, helplesse she did sore complaine
Of their inhumane usage, but her griefe,
Sighs, sobs, teares, throbs, could yeeld her small reliefe:
For in the end one of this forlorne crew,
Seiz'd on my long-lov'd Celia as his dew,
To whom espousd whether she would or no,
She ends her life, her tedious life, in wo.

LINUS.
A sad event:  but can she not be freed?

CORYDON.
To what end Linus, she's dishonoured!

TECHNIS.
Unhappie fate.

CORYDON.
Besides, she now is tide,
And by enforcement, made anothers Bride.
Come shepheards come, and say if ever time,
Made heardmens woes so ripe, as't hath done mine.

SAPPHUS.
Yes Corydon, though thou thy griefes hast showne,
Which makes thee thinke none equall to thine owne,
I have a Tale will move compassion too,
If Swaines have any pittie.

DYMNUS.
Pray thee how?

SAPPHUS.
Nay I will not be daintie; but attend,
And then compare our stories to the end,
And you'le conclude that never any Swaine
Did love so well, and reape so small a gaine.
