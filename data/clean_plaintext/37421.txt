Ye waves, that gushing fall with purest stream,
Blandusian Fount!  to whom the products sweet
Of richest vines belong,
And fairest flowers of spring;
To thee, a chosen victim will I slay,
A kid, who glowing in lascivious youth
Just blooms with budding horn,
And with vain thought elate
Yet destines future war:  but ah!  too soon
His reeking blood with crimson shall enrich
Thy pure transluscent flood,
And tinge thy crystal clear.
Thy sweet recess the sun in mid-day hour
Can ne'er invade, thy streams the labour'd ox
Refresh with cooling draught,
And glad the wand'ring herds.
Thy name shall shine with endless honors grac'd,
While on my shell I sing the nodding oak,
That o'er thy cavern deep
Waves his embowering head.
