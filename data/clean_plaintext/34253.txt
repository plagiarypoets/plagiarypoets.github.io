When Pope, sweet bard!  forsook the seats of men,
And join'd, in happy vales, th' Elysian train,
With kindred shades, thro' flow'ry paths to rove,
And animate with song the vocal grove;
"Our Sun (we cry'd) withdraws his wonted ray,
And robs this golded atmosphere of day;
No more these eyes shall view Pierian light;
Whelm'd in the gloom of dulness and of night!"
How vain our fears!  for, lo!  with equal flame,
Attends our Sun; another and the same!
His rival beams enlighten, as they roll,
Warm the dull clay and vivify the soul!
The source of Europe's dire disasters show,
And bid, as Briton's ought, his Britons glow.
Blest sons of Phoebus, and the tuneful nine!
In whom the various charms of song combine;
Thee Spencer's fancy, Cowley's wit, inspire,
And Pope's sharp satire, join'd with Milton's fire:
While Shakespear's grace, and Dryden's happy vein,
Gild thy smooth numbers, and adorn thy strain.
Thy vast invention, which no limits bound,
Tow'rs o'er the skies, or shoots the deep profound:
Yet sober reason still its flights controuls,
In night's dark regions, or the starry poles.
How just thy portrait of the gloomy vale,
Where rage, where woes, despair and anguish dwell!
There vice is virtue, there fell hate is love,
Th' exact reverse of happier states above!
Not others so: &mdash; for, but remove the pain,
Their hell's another earth, their fiends are men.
Proceed, sweet Muse's son!  and born to charm!
Sing how Rebellion sunk by WILLIAM's arm!
Not less from hell that horrid pest arose,
Dark as her native shades, and big with woes!
Too far, in quest of subject, hast thou gone;
Thy Albion boasts a heroe of her own;
A youth, in all the prowess of the plain,
And martial skill, not second to Lorrain!
