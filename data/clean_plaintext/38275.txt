Much wond'rous Goode dothe Baia's Founte dispense.
More wond'rous farre dothe flowe Thyne Eloquence.
My Springes may aide some palsied Lymbe to free:
Thy myghtier Cure &mdash; must not comparede be:
Britannia's Self restor'd &mdash; to Libertie.

Ye kyndrede Streams, O!  keepe your wontede Course:
Let Ages prove your uncorrupted Source.
May humble Crutche bedecke poore Bladud's Shryne:
Britannia's Hearte be offerede uppe at Thyne.
