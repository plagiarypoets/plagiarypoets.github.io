How bravely Autumn paints upon the sky
The gorgeous fame of Summer which is fled,
Hues of all flowers that in their ashes lie
Trophied in that fair light whereon they fed,
Tulip, and hyacinth, and sweet rose red,
Like exhalations from the leafy mould,
Look here how honour glorifies the dead,
And warms their scutcheons with a glance of gold!&mdash;
Such is the memory of poets old,
Who on Parnassus' hill have bloom'd elate;&mdash;
Now they are laid under their marbles cold,
And turn'd to clay, whereof they were create;
But God Apollo hath them all enroll'd,
And blazoned on the very clouds of fate!
