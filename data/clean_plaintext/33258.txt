So have I often heard in forrest fair,
When spring begins with calm and gentle air,
Grave Citizens, which thither do resort,
Oft sing by turns, oft joyn in one consort;
Till Philomel to welcome Phoebes light,
Having their musick heard with due delight,
Sends from her brest such Lute-like warbeling,
The other Birds are all asham'd to sing,
And listning, in one strain most sweet and clear,
Do all their changes in one Dittie hear.
And so have often seen the shepheard swains,
Wooing the shepheardesses on the plains,
Challenge their mates by single pipe and voice,
And joyn in consort with harmonious noise,
That all the shepheards dance to hear them sing,
And forrests all with joy aloud do ring,
Till Phillis with one stroke of warbling Lute,
The shepheards pipes, and voices all makes mute;
Yea Collin Clout doth break his Pipe for shame,
To hear the heav'nly ditties of his Dame.
Thus oft she solaced for recreation,
But most alone, for holy meditation,
She in her Orchard walketh every day,
To read the Scriptures, meditate and pray,
Where by sublime pure heavenly contemplation,
With God and Angels she hath conversation,
And by true faith, and her spiritual eye,
As present, doth the day of Christ descry.
