Of all the various lots around the ball,
Which Fate to man distributes, absolute;
Avert, ye gods!  that of the Muse's son,
Curs'd with dire poverty!  poor hungry wretch!
What shall he do for life?  he cannot work
With manual labour:  Shall those sacred hands,
That brought the counsels of the gods to light;
Shall that inspired tongue, which ev'ry muse
Has touch'd divine, to charm the sons of men:
These hallow'd organs!  these!  be prostitute
To the vile service of some fool in pow'r,
All his behests submissive to perform,
Howe'er to him ingrateful?  Oh!  he scorns
Th' ignoble thought; with generous disdain,
More eligible deeming it to starve,
Like his fam'd ancestors renown'd in verse,
Than poorly bend to be another's slave,&mdash;
Than feed and fatten in obscurity.
&mdash;These are his firm resolves, which fate nor time,
Nor poverty can shake.  Exalted high
In garret vile he lives; with remnants hung
Of tapestry:  But oh!  precarious state
Of this vain transient world!  all pow'rful time!
What dost thou not subdue?  See what a chasm
Gapes wide, tremendous!  See where Saul enrag'd,
High on his throne, encompass'd by his guards,
With levell'd spear, and arm extended sits,
Ready to pierce old Jesse's valiant son,
Spoil'd of his nose! &mdash; around in tott'ring ranks,
On shelves pulverulent, majestick stands
His library; in ragged plight, and old;
Replete with many a load of criticism,
Elab'rate products of the midnight toil
Of Belgian brains; snatch'd from the deadly hands
Of murd'rous grocer, or the careful wight,
Who vends the plant, that clads the happy shore
Of Indian Patomack; which citizens
In balmy fumes exhale, when, o'er a pot
Of sage-inspiring coffee, they dispose
Of kings and crowns, and settle Europe's fate.

Elsewhere the dome is fill'd with various heaps
Of old domestick lumber; that huge chair
Has seen six monarchs fill the British throne:
Here a broad massy table stands, o'erspread
With ink and pens, and scrolls replete with rhyme:
Chests, stools, old rasors, fractur'd jarrs half full
Of muddy Zythum, sour and spiritless:
Fragments of verse, hose, sandals, utensils
Of various fashion, and of various use,
With friendly influence hide the sable floor.

This is the bard's musaeum, this the fane
To Phoebus sacred, and th' Aonian maids:
But oh!  it stabs his heart, that niggard fate
To him such small measure should dispense
Her better gifts:  to him!  whose gen'rous soul
Could relish, with as fine an elegance,
The golden joys of grandeur, and of wealth;
He who could tyrannize o'er mental slaves,
Or grace a gilded coronet with a mien,
Grand as the haughtiest Timon of them all.&mdash;

But 'tis in vain to rave at destiny,
Here he must rest and brook the best he can,
To live remote from grandeur, learning, wit;
Immur'd amongst th' ignoble, vulgar herd,
Of lowest intellect; whose stupid souls
But half inform their bodies; brains of lead
And tongues of slander:  whose insensate breasts
Ne'er felt the rapt'rous, soul-entrancing fire
Of the coelestial muse; whose savage ears
Ne'er heard the sacred rules, nor ev'n the names
Of the Venusian bard, or critic sage
Full-fam'd of Stagyra:  Whose clam'rous tongues
Stun the tormented ear with colloquy,
Vociferate, trivial, or impertinent;
Replete with boorish scandal:  Yet, alas!
This, this!  he must endure, or muse alone,
Pensive and moping o'er the stubborn rhyme,
Or line imperfect &mdash; No!  the door is free,
And calls him to evade their deaf'ning clang,
By private ambulation; &mdash; 'tis resolv'd:
Off from his waist he throws the tatter'd gown,
Behold with indignation; and unloads
His pericranium of the weighty cap,
With sweat and grease discolour'd; then explores
The spacious chest, and from its hallow womb
Draws his best robe, yet not from tincture free
Of age's rev'rend russet, scant and bare;
Then down his meagre visage waving flows
The shadowy perruque; crown'd with gummy hat
Clean brush'd; a cane supports him.  Thus equip'd
He sallies forth; swift traverses the streets,
And seeks the lonely walk; "Hail sylvan scenes,
Ye groves, ye vallies, ye meand'ring brooks
Admit me to your joys," in rapt'rous phrase,
Loud he exclaims; while with th' inspiring Muse
His bosom labours; and all other thoughts,
Pleasure and wealth, and poverty itself,
Before her influence vanish.  Rapt in thought,
Fancy presents before his ravish'd eyes
Distant prosperity, upon his page
With transport dwelling; while bright learning's sons
That ages hence must tread this earthly ball,
Indignant seem to curse the thankless age,
That starv'd such merit.  Meantime swallow'd up
In meditation deep, he wanders on,
Unweeting of his way. &mdash; But ah!  he starts!
With sudden fright!  his glaring eye-balls roll,
Pale turn his cheeks, and shake his loosen'd joints,
His cogitations vanish in the air,
Like painted bubbles, or a morning dream.
Behold the cause!  see!  thro' the opening glade,
With rosy visage, and abdomen grand,
A cit, a dun! &mdash; As in Apulia's wilds,
Or where the Thracian Hebrus rolls his wave,
A heedless kid, disportive, roves around,
Unheeding, till upon the hideous cave
Of the dire wolf she treads; half-dead she views
His bloodshot eye-balls, and his dreadful fangs,
And swift as Eurus from the monster flies.
So fares the trembling bard; amas'd he turns,
Scarce by his legs upborn; yet fear supplies
The place of strength; straight home he bends his course,
Nor looks behind him till he safe regain
His faithful citadel; there spent, fatigu'd,
He lays him down to ease his heaving lungs,
Quaking, and of his safety scarce convinc'd.
Soon as the Panick leaves his panting breast,
Down to the Muse's sacred rites he sits,
Volumes pil'd round him; see!  upon his brow
Perplex'd anxiety, and struggling thought,
Painful as female throes:  whether the bard
Display the deeds of heroes; or the fall
Of vice, in lay dramatick; or expand
The lyrick wing; or in elegiac strains
Lament the fair; or dash the stubborn age,
With laughing satire, or in rural scenes
With shepherds sport; or rack his hard-bound brains
For th' unexpected turn.  Arachne so,
In dusty kitchen corner, from her bowels
Spins the fine web; but spins with better fate,
Than the poor bard:  she!  caitiff!  spreads her snares,
And with their aid enjoys luxurious life,
Bloated with fat of insects, flesh'd in blood:
He!  hard, hard!  lot!  for all his toil and care,
And painful watchings, scarce protracts a while
His meagre, hungry days!  ungrateful world!
If with his drama he adorn the stage;
No worth-discerning concourse pays the charge,
Or of the orchestra, or th' enlight'ning torch.
He who supports the luxury and pride
Of craving Lais; he!  whose carnage fills
Dogs, eagles, lyons; has not yet enough,
Wherewith to satisfy the greedier maw
Of that most rav'nous, that devouring beast,
Yclep'd a poet.  What new Halifax,
What Somers, or what Dorset can'st thou find,
Thou hungry mortal?  break, wretch, break thy quill,
Blot out the study'd image; to the flames
Commit the Stag'rite; leave this thankless trade;
Erect some pedling stall, with trinkets stock'd,
There earn thy daily half-pence, nor again
Trust the false Muse:  So shall the cleanly meal
Repel intruding hunger. &mdash; Oh!  'tis vain,
The friendly admonition's all in vain;
The scribbling itch has seiz'd him, he is lost
To all advice; and starves for starving's sake.

Thus sung the sportful Muse, in mirthful mood,
Indulging gay the frolick vein of youth;
But, oh!  ye gods, avert th' impending stroke
This luckless omen threatens!  hark!  methinks,
I hear my better angel cry, "Retreat,
Rash youth!  in time retreat!  let those poor bards,
Who slighted all, all!  for the flatt'ring Muse,
Yet curs'd with pining want, as landmarks stand,
To warn thee from the service of th' ingrate."
