Give me the lyre &mdash; the lyre of memory's tone,
That I may make it eloquent of me
And of my feelings!  When, the spell hath flown,
That bound us earthward whither may we flee,
If not to thee, almighty Minstrelsy?
Youth &mdash; friendship &mdash; hope &mdash; love's dreams of dawning bliss,
Illumining the future &mdash; all shall be
As winter sunshine; but a sound like this,
Sung to the ear of night from wave-wash'd precipice,

Is an eternal soother of the heart;&mdash;
The heart that hath gone forth amid the world,
Undimm'd by sorrow &mdash; undefil'd by art
Whose tranquil wave life's breath had scarcely curl'd,
When the wild tempest's banner was unfurl'd&mdash;
The heart that bled and battled thro' the throng
On whom the burning bolts of death were hurl'd,
And lifting Virtue's aegis, rush'd along
From Passion's storm and reach'd his peaceful hills of song.

And here I sit, existence' tumult pass'd&mdash;
The lone blue world of waters spread before me,
Their rippling music on the calm shore cast,
And th' heav'ns, all pure and starry, sparkling o'er me:
What are my ills if they to you restore me,
Hills of the eagle's pride and torrent's roar!
Ocean!  that on thy snow-white bosom bore me
To thee thy nurseling bard returns once more,
To wake his lyre along thy solitary shore.

But he returns, alas!  not as he left
His rocky home of joys!  It recks not how
Of its young dreams his soul hath been bereft,
And of their false fair light his darken'd brow:
He feels that what he was he is not now!
Yet is it not rejuvenescent joy,
Thus to this haven of calm to steer his prow,
And wake to feelings, years could not destroy,
The humble lyre he swept when he was but a boy!
