Yes, doubts and griefs may cloud my cheerless day,
But peace attends the visions of the night,
For then, in fair and magical array,
The loved and lost, the beautiful and bright,
Come round my pillow in a sparkling train,
Charming my thoughts to long past hours again.

I see their sweet familiar forms, I hear
Voices that spoke erewhile of love and truth,
And household scenes to early feeling dear,
Return, array'd in all the glow of youth,
Ere sordid cares, and grovelling thoughts of earth,
Had chill'd the festive board, the joyous hearth.

And when I wake, and o'er my troubled heart,
Comes the dim consciousness of pleasures fled,
Sadly I turn from life's deceptive art,
To mourn the tried fond friendships of the dead;
Yet sweet and soothing the reflection seems,
That I can view them in the land of dreams.

And not, I trust, in vain, these forms of love
Their radiant visits on my sleep bestow,
They seem bright heralds from a world above,
They bid me tread their holy steps below,
And seek and pray to join them on that shore,
Where sever'd friends shall meet &mdash; to part no more.
