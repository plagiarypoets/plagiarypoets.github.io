True, flower-crown'd queen, unnumber'd are the songs,
Unnumber'd poets in thy praise have fram'd;
Yet to thee still so sweet a charm belongs,&mdash;
Such transports glad our souls when thou art named,
Felt not by heroes e'en nor poets, famed
For inspiration these, and those for arms,
(Tho' wreathes of fadeless bay by each are claim'd,)
Apollo's heaven-strung lyre and Mars' alarms;&mdash;
That, May, I would thee liken to the calms
That sleep serenely on a summer sea;
Or, when our happiest days life's sunbeam warms,&mdash;
The space 'twixt manhood and mild infancy,
When nought save pleasure smiles our steps around;
For with thee, month of love, those joys again are found!
