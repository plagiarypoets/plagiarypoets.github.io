Hark!  the shrill trumpet calls to feats of ARMS,
Encount'ring legions darken all the plain;
From shore to shore resound the loud alarms,
The POW'R of BATTLES calls forth all his train.
Soft meek-ey'd PEACE from wild DISORDER flies;
And, leaving scenes of blood, ASTRAEA mounts the skies.

Where ancient Danube rolls his swelling wave,
Where lofty AUSTRIA'S wide domains extend,
What mighty chiefs shall find a timeless grave,
Ere the dire contest of ambition end!
Yet glorious WAR!  the world's great lords proclaim,
WAR!  Glorious WAR!  resounds the trump of Fame!

I know thee, WAR!  in all thy pomp array'd,
Thy banners waving o'er the tented field,
With "all the glorious circumstance" display'd,
That tempts to reap the harvest arms can yield:
The multitude thy pomp admiring views,
While HONOUR, mighty shade!  thy giant steps pursues.

Rich is thy robe; full haughty is thy stride,
And oft' thy temples are with laurels bound;
But whence those gorgeous robes in crimson dy'd,
And whence thy brow with dazzling splendours crown'd?
Thy trappings cast aside, what view we there,
But horror, pain, and blood, and anguish, with despair?

Else, why does yon fair mourner to the winds
Oft sigh in vain; in vain her love require;
While he his fate in hostile conflict finds?
Why does yon orphan mourn his slaughter'd sire?
Why? &mdash; But that angry Heav'n waves high the brand
Committed to thy charge, to plague each guilty land.

But far remov'd from ALBION be thy reign;
Far from our country's Heaven-descended tow'rs:
Too much we know of THEE, and of thy train,
Thy wounds we felt! &mdash; Tranquility be ours!
Let PEACE her mildest influence here display,
And distant nations hail her happy sway!
