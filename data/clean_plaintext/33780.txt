Not that the living Muse is to be scorn'd;
Britain with equal worth is still adorn'd.
See Halifax, where sense and honour mixt
Upon the merits just reward have fixt;
And read their works who writing in his praise
To their own verse immortal laurels raise.
Learn Prior's lines, for they can teach you more
Than sacred Ben or Spencer did before;
And mark him well that uncouth physick's art
Can in the softest tune of wit impart.
See Pastorella o'er Florello's grave,
See Tamerlane make Bajazet his slave,
And Phaedra with her ancient vigour rave.
Thro' Rapin's nurseries and gardens walk,
And find how nymphs transform'd by am'rous colours talk.
Pomona see with Milton's grandeur rise,
The most delicious fruit of Paradise,
With apples might the first-born man deceive,
And more persuasive voice than tempting Eve.
