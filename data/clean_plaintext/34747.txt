When Venus saw Adonis dead,
And from his cheeks the roses fled,
His lovely locks distain'd with gore:
She bad her Cupids bring the boar,
The boar that had her lover slain,
The cause of all her grief and pain.
Swift as the pinion'd birds they rove
Through every wood, through every grove;
And when the guilty boar they found,
With cords they bound him, doubly bound;
One with a chain, secure and strong,
Haul'd him unwillingly along;
One pinch'd his tail to make him go,
Another beat him with his bow:
The more they urg'd, the more they dragg'd,
The more reluctantly he lagg'd.
Guilt in his conscious looks appear'd;
He much the angry goddess fear'd.
To Venus soon the boar they led&mdash;
"O cruel, cruel beast!  she said,
Durst thou that thigh with blood distain?
Hast thou my dearest lover slain?"
Submissive he replies; 'I swear
By thee, fair queen; by all that's dear;
By thy fond lover; by this chain;
And by this numerous hunter-train;
I ne'er design'd, with impious tooth,
To wound so beautiful a youth:
No; but with love and frenzy warm,
(So far has beauty power to charm!)
I long'd, this crime I'll not deny,
To kiss that fair, that naked thigh.
These tusks then punish, if you please,
These are offenders, draw out these.
Of no more use they now can prove
To me, the votaries of love!
My guilty lips, if not content,
My lips shall share the punishment.'
These words, so movingly exprest,
Infus'd soft pity in her breast;
The queen relented at his plea,
And bad her Cupids set him free:
But from that day he join'd her train,
Nor to the woods return'd again;
And all those teeth he burnt with fire,
Which glow'd before with keen desire.
