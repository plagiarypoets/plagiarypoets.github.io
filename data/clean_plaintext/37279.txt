Yes!  it is quench'd &mdash; the spark of heavenly fire,
That Genius kindled in my infant mind:
Fled is my fancy:  damp'd the fond desire
Of fame immortal; &mdash; all my dreams resign'd.
All, all are gone:  yet turn I ne'er behind
Like pilgrim wending from his native land?
Shall I in other path such beauties find,
As spring beneath imagination's hand,
As bloom on wild enthusiasm's visionary strand?

Celestial Genius!  dangerous gift of Heaven!
How many a heart and mind hast thou o'erthrown!
Broken the first, the last to frenzy driven,
Or jarr'd of both for aye the even tone!
Once, once I thought such fate would be my own,
And only look'd to find an early grave;
To die, as I had liv'd &mdash; my powers unknown;
Content, so reason  might her empire save,
Unseen to sink beneath oblivion's rayless wave.

But oh!  with all thy pains, thou hast a charm
That nought may match within this vale below;
E'en for the pangs thou giv'st, thou hast a balm,
And renderest sweet the bitterness of wo.
Thy breath ethereal &mdash; thy kindling glow&mdash;
Thy visions bright &mdash; thy raptures, wild and high;
He that hath felt &mdash; Oh!  would he e'er forego?
No! &mdash; in thy glistening tear thy bursting sigh,
Though fraught with wo, there is a thrill of ecstasy!

And art thou flown, thou high celestial power?
For ever flown? &mdash; Ah!  turn thee yet again!
Ah!  yet be with me in the lonely hour,
Yet stoop to guide my wilder'd fancy's rein!
Turn thee once more, and wake thy ancient strain;
No joys that earth can yield I love like thine:
Nay, more than earth's best joys I love thy pain.
And could I say, I would thy smile resign?
No, while this bosom beats, oh still great gift be mine!
