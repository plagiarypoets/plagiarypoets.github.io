Avaunt, thou fiend!  thou haggard sprite,
Attendant on the shades of night!
When screech-owls haunt the solemn scene,
And shadows tremble o'er the green,
Thou stand'st erect, with bristly hair,
And wring'st the soul with wild despair.

Where Danger, 'mid the howling storm,
Assumes his fell terrific form;
Where Vengeance, with her hideous brood,
And Indignation, thirst for blood;
Thou, 'mid the wreck, uprear'st thy head,
Fraught with the poignant pangs of dread.

Him, whom remorseful grief and fear,
With Conscience' gnawing tumults tear,
Tho' golden canopies surround
His head, with regal badges crown'd;
Not all his dignity, nor art,
Can screen from thy relentless dart.

The murd'ring thief along the glade
Beholds the visionary shade:
Where'er he turns his wand'ring eyes,
Thro' ev'ry bush the phantom flies;
His heart's a prey to grim despair&mdash;
For HORROR sits triumphant there!
