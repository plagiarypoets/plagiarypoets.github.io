How idle, how weak are thy strains,
Repeated so oft in the grove,
Describing the pleasures and pains,
That constantly wait upon Love.

When forc'd from my Maria to go,
The maid to my bosom I press;
No language can utter my woe,
No melody speak my distress.

But when I am charm'd with the sight,
When blest by the voice of my fair;
Ye shepherds, your notes of delight,
My bliss makes the notes of despair.
