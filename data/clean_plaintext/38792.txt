'Tis night:  and in this solemn hour of sleep,
What time the Screech-owl sails her heavy round,
And clamours discord o'er this spectered ground,
With lowly heart and pensive pace I creep&mdash;

To view, alas!  Mortality's sad doom!&mdash;
The proud man's trophied urn, the hero's bust,
Serve but to aggravate the awful gloom:
The Vassal's mingled with the Tyrant's dust!

Who but would mock yon sculptur'd skill to tell
His sceptered lineage, or his paltry throne,
When Worth has fled without a passing-bell,
And many an honest heart has sunk unknown;&mdash;

When Genius could retreat without a sigh
Or friend to chaunt a requiem to his closing eye!
