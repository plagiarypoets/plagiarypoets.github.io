HORACE to PINDAR might impute
His lofty tuneful Tongue:
And COWLEY'S MUSE had still been mute,
Had SPENSER'S never sung.

MAEVIUS makes D'URFEY'S Rhimes his own,
TOM'S Pegasus he tries:
And &mdash; was it not for tumbling down,
In Time might reach the Skies.

So School-Boys oft are seen to fail
In rearing of their Kite;
When heavy Papers load it's Tail,
And curb it's wonted Flight.
