On June, the year, nor less nor mae
Than eighteen hunder a' but twae,
Fornent a brig laid owr a pool,
A wee bit frae the parish scool,
Upon a brae baith dry and clean,
Twae 'onest lads sat down to lean,
And haud the following conversation
About th' affairs o' their ain nation.
Geordie look'd sowr and discontentit,
While Watie thus his wonder ventit:

WATIE.
I wonder, Geordie, what's the matter,
I never saw a douther creature;
Tho' twice a day this while I've met w'ye,
A heartsome crack I ne'er can get w'ye;
When I wad fain divert an' please ye,
In trouth you nouther hear nor sees me;
Thy thoughts are wand'ring, L&mdash;d knows whither,
An' what upon, for I ken neither.
Cast roun' your een on ilk thing near yer,
See, ilka thing combines to cheer ye;
Your friends are weel, your wages gude,
What then keeps up this dowie mude?
Come, tell me man, is Nelly faithless?
Or is she turnin' round an' breathless?

GEORDIE.
I've nought like that my heart to grieve;
My Nelly's true, and I believe
Her free frae ony man on earth,
This day, as that whilk gae her birth:
But how can I be blythe, while viewin'
My dear dear country gaun to ruin?

WATIE.
Hey, master patriot!  now I smoke ye,
An', on my saul, right fain wad 'nock ye,
For mindin things o' sic a nature;
But let us argue out the matter.
Shew me the signs o' Britain's ruin,
An' wha's the cause o' her undoin'.

GEORDIE.
Alas!  a cloud o' wrath hangs ow'r us,
Ready to burst an' quite devour us.
Our fathers truth for error barters,
An' shed the blude o' sants and martyr's.
Their sons are sae degen'rate grown,
That ilka thing's turn'd upside down.
Religion's grown a laughing stock,
A butt for fools whereat to mock,
An ugly thing, that, anes detectit,
The owner o't is ay suspectit.
The ither day when at the mill,
I heard ane thus describin' Will:

"I own he is a man o' wit,
And on some exc'llent schemes has hit;
His wants are few, his wealth prodigious,
But, rot his heart!  he damn'd relig'ous."
The gude commands that sude direct us,
An', war they keepit, might protect us,
I' our blest days, ir nae mair takin',
Than British laws to save a maukin;
An', for the se'enth, keep it we wad,
If it requir'd what it forbade;
For you, and idle sinners like you,
Count less o' yon than man an' wife do.
A scourge then for this guilty land!
Nor can the time be fer frae hand;
Its fairest flow'r already fadin',
As was foretold by Welch an' Peden.

WATIE.
Faith, leave the plowmen, join the tent anes,
And unto sinners preach repentance;
For I can guess, frae this oration,
Ye're join'd that headstrong, dull perswasion;
But a' your Cameronian rants,
'Bout solemn leagues an' covenants,
'Bout kings, an' laws, and constitutions,
Supremacy an' persecutions,
S'al never keep me frae insistin'
On our laws bein' the best existin'.
Nor are we just sae fair abandon'd,
As you appear to understand it;
We've mair to shew of pious zeal
Than ony age that's past a deal;
What think ye o' sic contributions,
For biggin ships an' sendin missions,
To mak the gospel light to shine
I' nations fer ayont the line?
Our gentry, too, hae sign'd a letter,
Whilk binds to keep the Sabbath better.

GEORDIE.
That bond, I fear, they'll keep but ill;
For sen they past the Papish bill,
Frae ae mischief they've run t' nother,
An' neer had luck i' ane nor other.
E'en at this time, nae fether gane,
Our allies leave us ane by ane;
An' waur than that, our faes they join,
To pay us hame i' our ain coin.
Fo'ks een are open'd now, they see
The French design them liberty;
By makin' laws which fo'ks admire,
They've won mair than by sword an' fire.

WATIE.
Fo'ks een are open'd now, 'tis true;
But 'tis owr late, when, frae their view,
Fair Liberty's entirely vanish'd;
Frae States, where ance ador'd, she's banish'd.
The French, my friend, are kittle masters,
Likewise the cause o' fair disasters;
Whae else can ony body blame
For this rebellion here at hame.

What glory if, by British thunder,
These haughty knaves cou'd be brought under;
Then a' the silly dogs aroun' them,
Whae, courin', let them tramp aboon them,
Tho' forc'd, e'en now, their rage to bury,
Wad turn an' bite wi' double fury.

Thus, when th' impetuous Prince o' Sweden
Thro' Saxony in blude came waedin,
For mony year nae force cude stand him,
Whae ever try'd, their master fand him;
Europe, embroil'd in bloody quarrels,
Stood trembling at the name of Charles;
Ilk pow'r around to friendship prest him,
The proud did stoop, the brave carest him.
But mark how soon they chang'd their minds,
When he to Bender was confin'd.

When muckle Pate, wi' desp'rate fuffle,
Had at Poltowa won the scuffle,
And crusht the bravest band o' men
That Europe e'er will boast again,
Then all around the Swedes dominions,
Forgetting former ties and unions,
On him turn'd a' their arms anon,
'Til a' his richest lands were won:
Just sae great France wad soon be guidit,
Could Britain anes but lair the pride o't.
I own, like Amos, I'm nae prophet,
Yet on this head some notes I'll forfeit,
Who lives to see a few Decembers,
Will see this monster losin' members.

GEORDIE.
Faith, lose they, win they, I'm indiff'rent;
For come they, bide they, we've a liferent
O slav'ry o' the hardest kind,
Whilk has sae rous'd the public mind,
That, but for armies almaist countless,
Might gar our proud oppressors vaunt less.
When first this war i' France began,
Our blades bude hae a meddlin' hand;
Their raisin' men for't rais'd the cesses,
Whilk rais'd our discontents and stresses;
Our grumblin' reachin some fo'ks ears,
Of hameil brulies rais'd their fears;
Mae men they rais'd, and will perswade us,
The French is comin' to invade us;
But whether ever they design'd it,
Wi' a' my airt I ne'er can find yet;
Yet this I think, they'll gain their aim,
By threat'ning us afar thro' time.
Sic heaps o' men to cleed and pay,
Will brik the King, or breed a fray;
For if they raise the taxes higher,
They'll set alunt that smoostin' fire,
Whilk ilka session helps to beet,
An', when it burns, they'll get a heat.
The west side else hath gi'en a bleeze,
I mean the lads on Leinster lees;
Whae rather chuse to die wi' brav'ry,
Than grane out life in downright slav'ry.

WATIE.
O Geordie, man!  I'm wae to hear ye;
I like ye, else I coud'na bear w' ye:
The taxes true, hae got a stretch,
Ye few ava to poor fo'k reach.
These cursed notions you've imbibit,
Hae made your look &mdash; I can't describe it.&mdash;
Your cheeks are thin, your colour sallow,
The very white o'y'r een's turn'd yellow;
Your brows hang down at ilka corner,
And knit like ony ancient mourner;
You've got a weary length of face,
Wi' mouth as wide as Sandy Rae's;
Your claes ir strangely out of order,
Your hat has nouther string nor border;
Ye're gaun withouten shoon or boots,
But slorpin loags about your coots.
They've banish'd frae your mind content,
The greatest bliss that heav'n has lent.
I see the stem that feeds your fever,
Yet soon, I hope, the root will wither;
I ken that, frankit by Lord Napier,
Ilk week you read the Kelso paper.

GEORDIE.
Well, what o' that?  poor Jamie's lie'd on,
But tellna me o' poor fo'ks freedom;
If ane escape the taxes a',
Then that same ane has nought ava:
Our hats, our claes, our drink, our meat,
Our snuff, our baca, shoon o'ur feet,
Our candles, watches, horses, even
The very blessed light o' heaven;
Our dogs &mdash; but now, for want o' patience,
How I cou'd curse the vile taxations&mdash;
Thou wert my friend, poor 'onest DUSTY,
A faithful servant, true and trusty;
My fate an' me thou follow'd after,
Thro' frost an' snaw, thro' fire and water:
But thou'rt rewarded gratefully,
Hang'd like a thief outowr a tree!
That plaguy PITT!  cude I yoke wi' him,
The loss o' thee I might forgie him.

WATIE.
That tax on dogs is right mischievous,
On highland fo'k 'tis vastly grievous.

GEORDIE.
What!  lad ir ye sae soon forgettin',
That nane on yirth hae laws like Britain?

WATIE.
Weel man, I dinna grudge, tho' dear,
I pay twall shillin's ilka year,
An' wad gie mair wi' a my heart,
Wad ilka ane contribute part.
The nation's rich; if a were willin'
The King might ne'er be aun a shillin'.
His debt's become a cant right common;
The debt is our's, he's aun to no man.
When ye come next wi' corn to Johny,
On this brae side I'll wait upon ye;
An' then I'll baith convince you fairly
That government has acted squarely,
An' that our British helm's confidit
To hands that unco weel can guide it;
An' when we reach the mill I'll treat ye
Wi' a' their healths in acquavitty.

GEORDIE.
I canna do't, their names disgust me,
An' gar me mind my heartsome Dusty;
Yet their defence I'll gladly hear,
Wad they mak peace within a year,
An' mak the taxes somewhat leucher,
I'd rather see't than farm the Deuchar.

WATIE.
I wish as much for peace as ye do,
Tho' little ill the war I see do;
In gen'ral ilke thrifty man
Is richer than when it began.
Wi' faes we ne'er had sic a tilt,
In which less British blude was spilt;
Quite masters o' the sea they find us,
An' heavy neibers i' the Indies.

But man 'tis queer to mak sic fike
About an useless guaffin tike;
That ne'er cude gie a decent turn
At sheddin', fauldin', bought, nor burn;
But ran wi' inconsid'rate force,
An' bate their heels as they'd been horse.
I never thought, for a' your ruse,
That e'er he was for muckle use,
Except for drivin' nout to fairs,
Or rinnin' whinkin' after hares.
But if ye saw that ye wad need him,
Five shillins yearly wad hae freed him.

GEORDIE.
I never saw a finer beast,
Sin' I cou'd ken the west frae east;
But yet a crown was unco fair
On ane that cou'd sae little spare;
For a the wages e'er I won
Can scarcely keep my head aboon:
But I bude either flit or slay him,
For nae man off my hand wad hae him;
I didna like to flit, for fear
I might have idle lien a year;
My friends war poor, an' had nae need
That I sude hang on them for bread;
Sae was I forc'd, tho' vext and anger'd,
To gie consent to hae him hanged,
He had some prospect o' the deed,
For back he drew, and wadna lead.
His looks to me, I'll ne'er forget them,
Nae doubt he lookit for protection;
While I, unfeeling as the tree,
Stood still, and saw him hung on hie.
At first he spurr'd, an' fell a bocking,
Then gollar'd, pisht, and just was choaking:
Deil tak the King, an' burn his crown,
Quoth I, an' ran to cut him down;
When, poor, unlucky, senseless brute!
(Afore I never saw him do't)
He bate me till the blude did spring;
Confus'd an' hurt, I loot him hing
Owr lang for life; for on the green
He sprawl'd to death before my een.
I really felt extrodner pain;
I kend we ne'er wad meet again.
I grat for grief, his death to see
Whae aft had ventur'd life for me:
For ay when I wi' ane had grips,
He ran an' bit their heels or hips;
An' when I warstled wi' the women,
He tugg'd their tails, an' held them screamin'.

Last year he play'd a desp'rate prank,
When gaun wi' me to Stogshaw-bank:
I wi' a man, that houn'd our hogs,
Koostout an' feught, sae did our dogs;
I own I was but roughly guidit,
Nor was the quarrel weel decidit;
But ere we ceas'd frae rough contention,
The Saxon's dog was past redemption.

When weazels snirtit frae the dykes,
Or fumerts frae the braes an' sykes,
He cock'd his tail, an' geed his head,
O' scores o' them he was the dead.
Nae beast on yirth cude hae defy'd him;
If I had said the word, he try'd him.

But yet for a' his gruesome dealin's,
He was a dog o' tender feelin's;
When I lay sick an' like to die,
He watch'd me wi' a constant eye;
An' when where e'er I spak' or sturr'd,
He wagg'd his tail, a' whing'd, an nurr'd.
When saams were sung at any meetin',
He yowl'd, an' thought the fock war greetin'.

For wearin' corn of hens and cocks,
For huntin' o' the hare or fox,
For chafin' cats, an' craws, an' hoodies,
An' chackin mice, an' howkin moudies,
An' settin moorfowl, snipes, an' petrics,
His match was never made for thae tricks.
But now, poor beast, he's dead an' rotten,
An' his good deeds are a' forgotten.

WATIE.
I ken what grief I felt mysel'
In partin wi' my auld Springkell;
I wadna been as muckle troubl'd
For a' his value ten times doubl'd.

GEORDIE.
But night draws on, an I'm to meet
My Nelly up on Annan's treat.
Be o' our cracks a wee discreeter,
For HOGG pits a' we say to meter.
Fare-weel; I hope ere lang to see thee:&mdash;

WATIE.
Fare-weel; success an' joy gang wi' thee.
