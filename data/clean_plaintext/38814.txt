With furious Look, and with a Mighty Sound,
From Window peeping, Andrew gave the Cry.
So glance the Lightnings downward to the Ground,
So growling Thunders shade the frighted Sky.
For P&mdash; and M&mdash; Andrew stretch'd his Throat;
No Friend but Andrew to provoke the Strife!
And Alien in the Land, with scarce a Vote,
More vain, more mean, more vulgar than his Wife.
Thou silly, prating, self-important Fellow,
Resume thy proper Garb, dear Andrew, red and yellow.
