And it hath gone into the grave of time&mdash;
The past &mdash; the mighty sepulchre of all!
That solemn sound &mdash; the midnight's mournful chime,
Was its deep dead-bell! &mdash; but, within the hall,
The old and young held gladsome festival.&mdash;
What hath it left them, thus to cause such joy?&mdash;
Gray hairs to some &mdash; and hearts less green to all,
And fewer steps to where their fathers lie
Low in the church-yard cell &mdash; cold &mdash; dark &mdash; and silently!&mdash;

Strange time for mirth! &mdash; when round the leafless tree
The wild winds of the winter moan and sigh,
And while the twilight saddens o'er the lea,
Mute every woodland's evening melody&mdash;
Mute the wide landscape &mdash; save where, hurrying by,
Roars the dark torrent on its headlong flight,
Or, slowly smiling through the blackening sky,
Hoots unto solitude, the bird of night,
Seeking the domeless wall &mdash; the turret's hoary height:&mdash;

And yet with Nature, sooth, we need not grieve;
She does not heed the woes of humankind;
No; for the tempests howl, the waters heave
Their hoary hills unto the raging wind,
And the poor bark no resting-place can find:
And friends on shore shall weep &mdash; and weep in vain,
For, to the ruthless elements consign'd,
The seaman's corpse is drifting through the main,
Ne'er to be seen by them &mdash; nor heard of e'er again!

Now o'er the skies the orbs of light are spread,
And through yon shoreless sea they wander on:&mdash;
Where is the place of your abode, ye dead?
To what far regions have your spirits gone?
But ye are silent &mdash; silent as the stone
That gathers moss above your bed of rest,
And from the land of souls returneth none
To tell us of the place to which we haste:
But time will tell us all &mdash; and time will tell us best.

How still &mdash; how soft &mdash; and yet how dread is all
The scene around! &mdash; the silent earth and air!
What glorious lamps are hung in Night's high hall&mdash;
Her dome &mdash; so vast, magnificent, and fair!
Oh!  for an angel's wing, to waft me there!
How sweet, methinks, e'en for one little day,
To leave this cold, dull sphere of cloud and care,
And midst the immortal bowers above, to stray
In lands of light and love &mdash; unblighted by decay!

Surely there is a language in the sky&mdash;
A voice that speaketh of a world to come:
It wells from out thy depths, immensity!
And tells us this is not our final home.&mdash;
As the toss'd bark, amidst the ocean's foam,
Hails, through the gloom, the beacon o'er the wave;
So from life's troubled sea, o'er which we roam,
The stars, like beacon lights, beyond the grave,
Shine through the deep, o'er which our barks we hope to save!

Now gleams the moon on Arthur's mighty crest,
That dweller of the air &mdash; abrupt and lone;
Hush'd is the city in her nightly rest;
But hark! &mdash; there comes a sweet and solemn tone,
The lingering strains, that swell'd, in ages gone,
The music of the wake &mdash; oh!  many an ear,
Rais'd from the pillow gentle sleep hath flown,
Lists with delight, while blend the smile and tear,
As recollections rise of many a vanish'd year.

It speaks of former scenes &mdash; of days gone by&mdash;
Of early friendships &mdash; of the lov'd and lost&mdash;
And wakes such music in the heart, as sigh
Of evening wooes from harpstrings gently crost;
And thoughts and feelings crowd &mdash; a varied host,
O'er the lone bosom from their slumbers deep,
Unfelt amidst its winter's gathering frost,
Till the soft spell of music o'er it creep,
And thaw the ice away, and bid the dreamer weep!
