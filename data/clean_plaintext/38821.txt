The Boast of Rome, the Pride of Arts and Power,
Have sunk unaided in one common Grave,
Each in its Turn has known the fatal Hour,
Mortal Assistance all too weak to save.

As erst a friendly Shelter from the Rain,
Benighted near a Time worn Pile I sought,
The Wind-rock'd Walls descended on the Plain,
And mould'ring Turrets down in falling brought.

Then too a wand'ring Pilgrim thither led,
The Sky all frowning with a stormy Gloom;
Yon' antique Columns totter'd o'er his Head,
And falling Marbles thunder'd in the Room.

The Tempest ceas'd, the Aether grown serene,
The Moon her Light between the Cracks displays;
He turns aside to view the shatter'd Scene;
Its splendid Ruins with a Sigh surveys.

"Cou'd not (he cries) the thrice-surrounding Wall,
Nor all the Riches lavish'd by the Great,
Preserve the stately Fabric from its Fall,
Or snatch its Basis from the Hand of Fate!

"Yet here perhaps in some forgotten Age,
Liv'd once an Angel-Heart which knew to Love:
Cou'd charm with magic Voice a Tyrant's Rage,
Force down his Cheek the trickling Tear to move.

"Cou'd not fair Ella's Innocence and Truth
Defend its Arches from the Stroke of Time,
Wrest from Fate's cruel Grasp the sculptur'd Roof?
Alas he took her Lover in his Prime!

"Here might some Rosamond, in sad Despair,
Mourn the Possession of a Prince's Heart;
Or wretched Nun, whose Sire's too rig'rous Care
Barr'd from her Lover, feel the keenest Smart."

To a near Shelter forc'd, with list'ning Ear,
I caught his Accents as the Pilgrim spoke:
Scarce had he ended, when with Dart severe,
Death fix'd his Bosom with unerring Stroke.

I saw him fall &mdash; I gently rais'd his Head:
Vain were my Efforts, useless all my Aid:
He sleeps entomb'd among his kindred Dead,
In the cold Urn with Tears I saw him laid.

And you ye Vain, ye Giddy, and ye Gay,
Who idly Frolick in Life's early Morn,
Breathless ere Noon on the cold Earth may lay,
Or Sickness leave you wretched and forlorn.
