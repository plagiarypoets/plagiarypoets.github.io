Were I a moon-beam (quoth a love-sick swain
Musing beneath the shadowy cone of night)
I'd steal through yonder chamber-window's pane,
And on my sleeping charmer's lip alight:
Were I a zephyr, when morn's charms invite
Her wandering footsteps o'er the dewy lawn,
Around her damask cheek and bosom white,
I'd frish in fragrance from sweet flow'rs new drawn:
Oh!  were I but a kid or nice young fawn,
My fondness in a thousand pranks I'd show,
And lick her hand, and lie her lap upon,
And follow her wherever she should go!
"Fond youth, your idle fantastics forbear,"
Cry'd Common Sense, &mdash; "address her as you are."
