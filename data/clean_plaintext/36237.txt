A little isle rose smiling before me,
Glowing with light and loveliness; behind
I left the ancient world, around and o'er me
Rose a blue heaven, play'd a gentle wind,
And all was ripe with majesty and mind!
Nor was this beauty ting'd with aught of sadness,
Like pleasures of the world I had resign'd;&mdash;
Hope was not mockery &mdash; pleasure was not madness,
But o'er my bosom stole a soft and soothing gladness!

I said I left the world, but not alone&mdash;
Such joy had been less joyful were it so;
But I was not a solitary one&mdash;
One who had been my mate in all my woe;
One who had taught my lonely heart to know
Bliss amid cares that wore its youth away;
She wander'd by my side, content to go
Where'er my fate had destin'd me to stray;
Chaunting a soothing song to while our weary way.

That way was weary while we trod the earth,
Ceasing to be such when the homes of men
Faded upon our sight, and our new birth
Of joy began; when we no more could ken
The bluely-rising smokes of peopled glen,
We hail'd with rapture the high moutain's scorn
Of all things human; but were happier when
We saw arising, as a second morn,
The island of our love &mdash; where hope and joy were born!

The vision of such refuge had been long
An inmate of our bosoms, and behold
The sage's gentlest dream &mdash; bard's sweetest song&mdash;
All that Romance of fairy scenes hath told,
Burst on our ravish'd sight!
