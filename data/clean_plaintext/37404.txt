Sorrow's associate!  child of deep distress!
Despis'd, and unregarded by the world:
Tho' want has made thy name
The cruel jest of fools,
Come forth!  and wipe away that tide of tears,
Which washes from thy cheek the fainting rose,
And leaves thy bursting heart
A victim to despair.
Come forth!  for see!  to calm thy troubled soul,
And gild the cloud that shadows o'er thy brow,
Soft Charity appears,
With Pity by her side.
Sisters, like these, are enemies to Grief.
And each, as twins, the other strongly loves,
This gives the sweet command,
That instantly obeys.
To thee with looks of cordial love they come.
Oh!  kneel, and reverence the heav'n-born maids!
For 'tis but gratitude
To kiss their sacred hands.
Oh!  let me see those swelling tears no more!
Unless they flow for benefits receiv'd.
If so, I'll mingle mine,
And weep my joy sincere.
'Tis rich effusion, laudable and great,
And well becomes each honest Briton's eye;
For Britons, drops like these,
May never blush to shed.
