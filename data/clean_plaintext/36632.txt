Then trembling lyre, from thee fair freedom's strain,
Will burst like torrent from its native bed,
Impetuous, strong, when contest ploughs the plain,
Glidingly sweet, where softer scenes are spread;&mdash;
Then, bright reveal'd, will stand each mountain's head,
Each valley's bosom and each forest deep,
Rob'd in their stole of snow, while o'er them shed
Smile the moon's midnight beams, as in the steep
Of the clear sparkling heaven she doth her station keep:&mdash;

Shine in thy lay the northern summer's beam,
Bloom the bright flowers it wakes to instant birth,
Dash the unfetter'd torrent, the calm stream,
Flow bright between its banks of green-clad earth;
With sudden verdure stand the forest forth,
The pine-crown'd hill arise, down whos dark sides
Roll the white flakes before spring's sunny mirth,
That like compassion's once unfrozen tides,
Turn to a fruitful flood, that glads where'er it glides.

Yes &mdash; as the varied scenes by nature given,
Or fancy, nature-taught creates around,
Call out thy strains to paint in earth or heaven,
All that she gives below, or in the bound
Of yon bright arch appears &mdash; thou wilt be found,
Still faithful to her hues, her feelings still&mdash;
Whether the battle gleam, the battle sound,
The maiden's eye with secret tear-drop fill,
Or the rous'd patriot's voice each burning bosom thrill.
