Passing one day along a narrow road,
Where many briers straggled here and there;
It fortuned, as hastily I yode,
My hosen woefully a thorne to tear&mdash;
My hosen, which erewhile so comely were!
I, sore amased at so uncouth case,
'Gan ponder much how I mote it repair:
When sodainly along that way did pace
A damsel trim, by whom a loaded page did trace.

She me beholding in that shameful guise,
Aviz'd me of a dame that wonn'd foreby,
Who, sempstress hight, skill'd in all mysteries
Of healing rents unseemly to the eye,
So well, that uneath you mote them descrye!
Her straight I sought, and straightway ent'ring found
Sitting 'mong many garments hong on hie;
And all about on stooles, and on the ground,
Were basketts, that with hose and kerchiefs did abound.

She was a dame most busily inclin'd,
As mote right well by every one be red;
For you might never her at leisure find
From many things which her encombered
(As erst it was of busie Martha sed):
A pincushion well studded first she bare,
And all her gown with little ends was spred,
Which she was wont from off her stoffes to tear,
Or shear with scissars keen, she at her side did wear.

And them foreby a satchell was yhong,
Wherein were sundry implements empight,
Which do unto the housewife's trade belong&mdash;
A needle-booke in costly crimson dight,
Whose store of pointed steel was ever bright;
And threds of diverse hews therein were tyed
In paper doublets, folden faire and tight:
With other tools, she to her use applied,
And she did ever stitch, or darn some fissure wide.

And raunged upon her table mote ye see
Of crymping-yrons, sundry sized, store;
And yrons eke, that heated wont to be,
To smooth and press whate'er had wrinkles wore;
And paper patterns her were spred before,
With many things whose names I'note recall,
Tho' well I ken'd them while she used her lore
To mend what late so foully did befall,
Which done, in sooth the rent ye mote not spie at all!
