We parted:  Oh!  it was a painful hour!
Not that I thought him lost to me for ever,
I knew that mighty LOVE'S resistless power
Would re-unite us, ne'er again to sever;
For WE are wedded &mdash; not as thoughtless mortals,
Incited only by terrestrial views,
Enter that sacred fane's mysterious portals.
Our souls are wedded; that assurance strews
My widow'd path with flowers of fadeless hues.

Yet is the briefest parting hard, for LOVE,
Deprived of WISDOM, is a rayless sun;
A summer midnight, when no star above
Throws down one cheering ray; 'tis GOOD, alone,
Without her partner TRUTH; or it resembles
Warm, melting CHARITY, intent to bless,
When, without FAITH to guide her steps, she trembles
O'er the dark scene of human wretchedness,
Wondering if Heaven permits or will distress.

'Twas hard to part; and while his spirit hovered
On the cold lips my kisses could not warm,
I prayed and murmur'd; but, alas!  when covered
By the dark pall, they bore that manly form
To its cold grave, I lost the pang of sorrow,
For reason fled, and I'd a dreamless sleep;
But woke, in anguish, on the coming morrow,
No more to murmur, pray, or even weep,
For grief is ever silent when it's deep.

Humbled to earth, my self-upbraiding soul,
With mental tongue, exclaim'd, Thy will be done!
When, through my bosom, such a feeling stole,
As mocks the power of language; it was one
Of those delicious thrills of nameless rapture
We feel, when conscience, Heaven, and friends approve;
When earthly joys have lost power to capture&mdash;
For REUBEN'S spirit whispered, "Peace, sweet dove,
We're joined, for ever, in Conjugal Love."
