In lonely shades, from mortal view retired,
A youth indulged his solitary woe;
A pudding's loss his mournful muse inspired,
And bade his melancholy numbers flow.

Ah!  luckless fate, he cried, of human things!
All, all must hasten to the silent tomb:
While time flies by on unrelenting wings,
Puddings and empires meet one common doom.

The pride of sewet and the pomp of flower,
And all, that apples, all, that paste e'er gave,
Await alike the inevitable hour:
The paths of puddings lead but to the grave.

Oh!  pudding, loveliest of the pudding race!
Whose fond idea wakes my constant woe,
How didst thou shine, adorn'd with every grace,
That apples, flower, and sewet could bestow!

How didst thou shine, my pudding, on the board!
How my mouth water'd for thy charms divine!
What beauteous nymph such raptures could afford!
What lover's transports ever equall'd mine!

Oh!  cursed fate!  one little moment past,
And thou, my lovely pudding, wast no more!
How short the time my joys were doom'd to last!
How soon my dream of happiness was o'er!

Could I but clasp thee in my ardent jaws;
Could I but feast upon thy charms divine;
Gladly I'd scorn the giddy world's applause,
All earthly blessings gladly I'd resign.

But ah!  it ne'er was given me to possess
Such matchless sweets, by fate's abhorr'd decree;
For other mouths those sweets were doom'd to bless,
Nor was there left one little bit for me!
