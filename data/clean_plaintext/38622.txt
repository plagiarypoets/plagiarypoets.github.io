Mark'd ye (as the Northern blast
In hollow murmurs o'er yon mountain past)
A Fiend direct the storm;
'Twas Horror: &mdash; on a dusky cloud he sat,
His eye-brow stern as Fate,
Cast browner darkness o'er his faded form.

Where dwell'st thou, Horror &mdash; wrapt in midnight gloom,
Whilst whistling winds sound hollow to the ear;
Fix'st thou thine empire on the troubl'd air,
Or broodest o'er the trophy'd portals of a tomb?

Oft have I mark'd thee in each vary'd scene,
Whilst blue-ey'd Fancy (heav'nly queen)
Has lent her strength'ning aid;
Still sought in vain that dark retreat,
Where motley stride thy pacing feet;
Where hies thy ghastly form.

I've marked thee sitting o'er a murder'd corse
Amidst the warlike slain;
Paler was then thy wrinkl'd cheek
Than those stiff, murder'd limbs extended on the plain.

I've mark'd thee swifter than the whirlwind's flight
Borne through the shades of night,
Whilst Cynthia, peeping from a cloudy veil,
Cast only one dim shadow o'er thy visage pale.
Hail then, thou phantom!  henceforth I'll adore
Thy magic influence, though I dread thy power.
