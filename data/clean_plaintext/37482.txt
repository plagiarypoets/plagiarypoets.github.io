Fair Tree, my guide so oft upon my way,
Through wind, rain, snow, and nights with clouds obscure;
Grateful to me, as beams the far-seen ray
To sea-boat mariners, pledge of port secure;&mdash;
Ah, that for ages thou might'st yet endure,
And see a thousand crops their growth mature;
And still a virgin train of aspect bland,
View pleas'd thy neighb'ring shade; thy height the road command.

Much of my joys, and cares, and hopes, and fears,
Since thee first seen, on life's still wing has flown:
And thin the promise of remaining years,
When the full foliage time's keen blast hath strewn.
Soon may I stand all friend-reft and alone;
As leafless thou soon to the blast shalt moan;
Thy verdant honours spring may oft review;
Man on the grave alone hopes heaven's reviving dew.
