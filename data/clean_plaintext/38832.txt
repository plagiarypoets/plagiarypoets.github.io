Sad Philocles sigh'd to the Wind,
The Wind it lamented his Moan,
Whilst Echo stood pining behind,
And gave him back ev'ry Groan.

Ye Winds!  have the Grace to be mov'd,
Complaining the fond Shepherd said;
The hard-hearted Nymph is reprov'd
By the gentle Returns ye have made.

To Echo himself he address'd,
Compassion, says he, thou hast shown;
Which proves that the Pains of thy Breast
Are almost as great as my own.

'Twill yield me some little Relief,
With you a Companion, to stray,
The Night shall be spent in my Grief,
In Tales of your Sorrow the Day.

The languishing Theme of your Woe
The Shepherd Narcissus shall be,
For Phillis I'll mourn where I go,
Till grown a mere Shadow like thee.

Come, piteous Maid, let's retire
To whisper our Plaints in a Cave;
The pitiful Nymph said Retire,
Such Places are likest the Grave.

At last, on the Side of a Hill,
A damp dusky Cavern they found;
There Philocles sigh'd to his Fill,
And Echo repeated the Sound.

But yet the sad Nymph had an Art
Whereby she would flatter his Pains,
Tho' speaking the Thoughts of her Heart,
She seem'd but repeating the Swain's.

He seated himself on the Ground,
His Hand it supported his Head;
Despairing, he shew'd ev'ry Wound,
The changing false Phillis had made.

If once on his Rival he thought,
Ye Gods!  in a Rage he would cry,
Oh blast all the Charms he has got,
For whom I thus languishing die.

Narcissus was still Echo's Thought,
Ye Gods!  the sad Nymph would reply,
Oh blast all the Charms he has got,
For whom I, thus languishing, die.

Thus Philocles dy'd in Despair,
While Echo augmented his Pain:
When he dy'd, the sad Nymph did repair
To another sad desparate Swain.
