Morpheus, balmy god of sleep,
Softly o'er my senses creep,
Gently steal my heart from care;
Shed, O shed, thy poppies here;
Come, O come, and with thee bring,
Odours dropping from thy wing.
Come, and with thy blessings crown'd,
Wave thy dewy wand around;
Dipt in HYBLA'S rosy bed,
Wave it o'er my slumb'ring head:
Still, as SILENCE, let me lie,
Still, as summer breezes fly.

Softly beat, ye springs of life:
Cease, ah cease your busy strife;
See the silent god descends,
O'er the world his reign extends:
See him spread his peaceful sway,
See all nature him obey.

Calm inspire my golden dreams,
Calmer than the dimpled streams:
Bind my eyes with silken strings,
What is all the pomp of kings?
Downy god, in peace with you,
Let me bid the world adieu.
