For thy amusement first I tuned the lay,
And dress'd my thoughts in Spenser's antique style,
'Twas but a frolic task, a youthful play,
Whose best reward was thy approving smile.

It scarcely claim'd th' offended critic's rod,
We love to imitate what we admire;
The Persian thus adores the Solar God,
And lights, faint emblem, his terrestrial fire.

No longer inexperienced I presume
On fancied worth, beneath the quaint disquise,
But strip the veil, remove th' incumbent gloom,
And modern numbers give to modern eyes.
