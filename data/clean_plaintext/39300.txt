Daughter of Penury, this way direct
Thy trembling step; bland Charity extends
Her ready hand to ease
Thy ponderous load of woe.

Full well thy blood-stain'd eye, thy meagre cheek,
Where pinching hunger pines, thy palsied limbs,
Attest that simple truth
Speaks in thy plaintive tale.

O garb unseemly for a day so rude!
No covering shields thy head from sinking snows,
Thy tatter'd cloak invites
The frolic of wild winds.

The pointed flint, the jagged ice assault
Thy naked feet, ah naked feet that tread
Nor Pleasure's flowery path,
Nor sink in Luxury's down!

Thy delicacy tyrant Want expell'd;
Coy modesty expir'd, when first thy voice
In firmer tone recall'd
The hastening passenger.

Ye fair, who riot in indulgence!  cherish
Pity's soft tear, that starts to see this child
Of misery implore
Her sex's sister aid.
