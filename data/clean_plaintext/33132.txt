O could his father's genius leave the grave,
And reassume the facultys wee have,
What surfett of content might hee display
In viewing him, and in him see dead Gray,
Long since inter'd, reviv'd.  For Arthur's sonn
Holds Arthur's spiritt, though his corps bee donn:
And what devinest Spenser erst foretolde,
Finish'd in him, his eies should cleere beholde.
Where faire discretion, mixt with dauntless heart,
Sownds loud his prowess and proclaymes his art.
Whose infant Muse, succor'd by thy faire wing,
Had leave to thrive, and thriving learn'd to sing
With voice propheticke in those ruder parts,
Thyselfe sole patron both of arms and arts.
