Ye rose-colour'd damsels attend
A swain with an innocent heart!
Your mercy to COLIN extend;
To COLIN, devoid of all art.

He once had a pocket that shone
With guineas most heavenly bright:
"Come, take them," he cry'd, "they're your own:"
The ladies he loves to delight!

You know with what fondness you run,
While his money so tempting remain'd;
And you know, how you made him your sun,
When from presents your shepherd refrain'd.

He went to the wake in the dale,
And bought you up ribbons a score:
He paid for the dance in the vale,
But now he is able no more.

Some pity bestow on the swain;
Compassion don't fail to advance;
Lest, angry, this should be his strain,
"He pipes not, so you will not dance."
