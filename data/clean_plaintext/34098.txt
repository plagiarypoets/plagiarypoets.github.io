From Storms, from Thunder's Roar, from rude Alarms,
And from the clatt'ring Din of Martial Arms,
Ever secure, where Rumour never spreads
Her motly Tales, or Factions raise their Heads,
But, where Forgetfulness with Silence dwells,
By solitary Groves, and lonely Cells,
The Dome of Sleep is plac'd, in solemn State,
Near Death's dark Seat, and never-closing Gate:
The Dome itself a spacious Vault, each Room,
In black apparell'd, seems a dismal Tomb;
About it's Eves, in Winter's Season, lies
The Cuckow; thither wrathful Progne flies;
With Rest and Peace, during that Season, fills
Her Breast; unmindful of preceding Ills:
Far, far within, upon a sable Bed,
The God extends his Limbs, and rests his Head;
Around him swarming play fantastic Dreams,
Like Motes, that dance in the Sun's gaudy Beams;
The Door well barr'd, admits no trifling Guest,
That might the sullen Deity molest;
Else, all whom Wo, Disease, or Pain torment,
Wou'd rushing enter, to procure Content.
