Triumph! &mdash; the blow is sped! &mdash; And in its' speed
GOD'S arm struck with us! &mdash; 'Twas a glorious blow!
Never did British swords so nobly feed,
And never did their feast so nobly flow!&mdash;
Not by the Elements was crushed the floe,
Nor by the gathered might of Europe's band.&mdash;
He scaped the deluge of the Northern Snow,
And the sheer vengeance of the Southern Brand,
To fall beneath the force of Britain's single hand!
