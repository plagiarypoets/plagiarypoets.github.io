Yonne armedde trainne, on Bethleheme's plainne,
O redde, redde ys their pathe,
The sonne arose onne the conflict of foes,
Ande hee shalle goe downe onne their wrathe.

O!  who shalle join in the dreadfulle line,
That bathe their steppes in bloode?
Alle shalle join in the dreadfulle line,
For the cause ys the cause of Godde.

Lette the infidel bands, out-numberinge the sandes,
Wyth their banners cloudde the skie,
Fearre not their host, by the Holie Ghost,
The enemie shalle die!

Ande the fowls that flie through the murkie skie,
Shalle bee gorg'd wyth the Heathen deadde;
Ande the Crescent shalle falle from the rampart-walle
Ande the Redde-Crosse shalle wave yn ytts steadde.

Thenne lift, yee brave, fearlesse, the glaive
Redde wyth the Curdman's bloode,
Ande swearre to stande for the holie lande,
Yourre Savior, ande yourre Godde.
