Since Sipplewell extols the Wooden Spoon
In lines as hard and barren as his theme,
Why may not I (tho' not as he, Great Bard!
So duly qualify'd) attempt to sing
The praise of Wooden Head?  Whether of Box,
Of Oak Britannic, or exotic plant
Yclep'd Mahogony, or humble Ash,
Or Schoolboy-honour'd Plumbtree, be thy frame,
Hail hollow Block!  whose high Relievo front
Triumphant with variety of Wigs,
From learned Council's Tye, or Tradesman's Cutt,
Down to the Chairman's Caxon, seems to smile
As conscious of its use.  Tho' some may boast
Their heads replete with patriotic schemes,
Or amply lin'd with self-sufficient wit,
The quilt of Folly, I will hail thee still;
For thou art clear &mdash; Yet thro' thy solid crown
What eye can pierce? &mdash; Still let me chaunt thy praise,
As to my Wig upon thy surface fix'd,
The powder'd Chief applies his skilful aid
Benignant, to untwist the various knots,
Which blust'ring winds, and congregated rain,
Hang on its locks.  The 'Prentice, tho' he trips
Along the crowded Mall in Sunday bag,
Derives his consequence, O Block, from thee;
Oft as the wish'd for Holyday returns,
He views the honours of its powder'd curls,
And grins with pleasure, as in sneer oblique
Each Waiter can attest the known alarm.
Lo!  now to Roberts he inclines his steps
Affected.  Entring he accosts the Glass
With look of satisfaction.  Happy Youth!
In Hobby-horse of gilded Gingerbread;
Not more the Author of the Wooden Spoon
In his long-labour'd Verse; nor more the Man
Who to his wish has turn'd the Barber's Block;
That block, which asks a modern Poet's brains
To give its merit all its praises due.
I'll toss it, therefore, to an abler Bard,
Whose Head is better turn'd to write on Wood;
To Thee, O Sipplewell.
