To grander themes the song let others frame,
For rude, or cultivated charms, renown'd&mdash;
Hills, whence old Greece derives her classic name,
Garnish'd with gods, with towers and temples crown'd;
Adown whose sides, by shady woods embrown'd,
Nymphs, Satyrs, Fauns, and Dryads whilom stray'd,
Playing full many an antic trick and feat,
Such as no sublunary man or maid
Might now beseem, in any green retreat,
Albe't they both agreed for pleasure there to meet.

Such subjects and such scenery, though they shine,
Blazon'd by Fiction's fascinating art,
I deem unmeet to blend in verse of mine,
That aims but a faint outline to impart
Of a small eminence, or earthly wart,
Yclept a Fort, rais'd by the warlike Dane,
With not a little toil, in the days of yore,
Hard by where Lagan leads his liquid train
To wash the miry feet of old DROMORE,
And scour the rocky bed, that echoes to his roar.

Soon as the primrose, rous'd from wintry sleep,
Forsakes her couch beneath the budding thorn,
And, like some bashful virgin, seems to peep,
Out o'er th' unconscious bank her looks adorn;
When rolling Time brings round the welcome morn
Of Easter's festive tide, and Sol's bright beam
(Watch'd on that morn with superstitious care)
Is seen to dance, reflected by the stream;
Hither the youthful multitude repair,
And as they climb the MOUNT, their shouts resound in air.

Some to the top with straining steps ascend,
Frowning defiance on their peers below;
Some deftly round the spiral pathway wend,
Justling and gibing onward as they go;
Striving by turns each other down to throw,
And glorying at the hapless struggler's fall,
Who rolling headlong to the nether moat,
Vents on the giggling victor words of gall,
And vows revenge, for lo!  his fine new coat
Is so defiled with dirt, at home he dreads to shew't.

Meanwhile the pairs, whom other views engross,
Than such as these competitors inspire,
Without the risk of reputation's loss,
Into some less frequented walks retire,
(No mask on these occasions they require)
And tell their tales, and pledge their vows of love;
Or haply fix the day, when Hymen's band
Shall all their fond anxieties remove,
And crown their wishes with the "promised land,"
At distance always bright &mdash; but bleak, sometimes, at hand.

Thus glide the moments with wing'd speed away,
Till gentle Evening, from the purple west,
Doffing her downy robes of gold and grey,
In gradual shades descends on Earth's damp breast.
Warning the merry wanderers home to rest.
And now they part, with sighs of fond regret,
That such a day should end so soon;
Oft turning wistful eyes, when Sol has set,
On the dim east, to watch the tardy moon,
Whose friendly beams might still prolong the blissful boon.
