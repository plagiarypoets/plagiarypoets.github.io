To thee, who mindful of the Poet's fame,
Dost in these lines his vagaries peruse,
Hast curiosity to ask his name,
And taste and feeling to respect his muse,&mdash;

A dark eyed lass in Common-street may say,
"Often we see him, and to-morrow shall,
Brushing, with rapid step, the leaves away,
To meet Miss H&mdash; walking in the mall.

There in the front of yonder garden gates,
Whistling "Love wakes and weeps," with solemn eye,
And monumental patience, oft he waits,
And pores upon the Belles that babble by.

For who, to cold indifference a prey,
Visions like these without a sigh resign'd,
Or passed such lovely specimens of clay,
Nor cast one LONGING lingering look behind?

Some Lavalette in yonder pretty lass,
May be concealed &mdash; who may as faithful prove;
Some mute and songless Sappho there may pass,
Some Cleopatra, chaste, yet ALL for love.
CETERA DESUNT.
