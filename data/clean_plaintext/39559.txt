Furies!  Why sleep amid the carnage? &mdash; Rise!
Bring up my wolves of war, my pointed spears,
Daggers yet reeking, banners fill'd with sighs,
And paint your cheeks with gore, and lave your locks in tears.
On yon white bosom see that happy child!
Seize it, deface its infant charms!  and say,
Anarchy view'd its mangled limbs, and smil'd!
Strike the young mother to the earth! &mdash; Away!
This is my era!  O'er the dead I go!
From my hot nostrils minute murders fall!
Behind my burning car lurks feeble woe!
Fill'd with my dragon's ire, my slaves for kingdoms call!
Hear them not, father of the ensanguin'd race!&mdash;
World!  give my monsters way! &mdash; Death!  keep thy steady chase!

What howlings wake me! &mdash; my fair olives die!
Storms shake my bow'r, and drive me to the plain.&mdash;
Ah!  direful Anarchy, thy chariots fly
O'er worlds of weeping babes, o'er world of heroes slain!
Order!  Bright angel down yon rainbow glide!
From the mild bosom of my God appear!
O'er Gallia spread thy showy pinions wide:
O!  cool the fever'd mind!  and whisper to despair.
Envenom'd and unwelcome war!  will man
Long nurse thy furies or prolong thy stay?
Will not his fine, reflective spirit scan
Those desolations that have mark'd thy way?
Yes! &mdash; He shall wearied leave thy crimes, and prove,
All that is worthy man, is found with me and love.
