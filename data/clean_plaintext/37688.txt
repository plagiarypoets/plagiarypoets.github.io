Hail, blushing goddess, beauteous spring,
Who, in thy jocund train, doth bring
Loves and graces smiling hours,
Balmy breezes, fragrant flowers,
Come, with tints of roseate hue,
Nature's faded charms renew.

Yet why should I thy presence hail?
To me no more the breathing gale
Comes fraught with sweets, no more the rose
With such transcendent beauty blows,
As when Cadenus blest the scene,
And shar'd with me these joys serene.
When, unperceiv'd, the lambent fire
Of Friendship, kindled new desire;
Still list'ning to his tuneful tongue,
The truths, which angels might have sung,
Divine imprest their gentle sway,
And sweetly stole my soul away.
My guide, instructor, lover, friend,
(Dear names) in one idea blend;
Oh!  still conjoin'd, your incense rise,
And waft sweet odours to the skies.
