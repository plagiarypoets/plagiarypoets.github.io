Where the Summer-breeze sports the young willows among,
That hang their soft leaves o'er the brook stealing by;
Or deep in the grove, where the thrush's clear song
Warbles sweet thro' the green branches waving on high;
Aloft on hoar mountains assailing the sky,
Or low in the humble and wood-border'd vale,
Wherever wild Solitude's dark pinions fly;
There oft has the Poet his varying tale
Of Pleasure's blithe harmony sung, or Despondency's sorrowful tale.

And blame not, ye worldlings, the choice he has made,
Nor contemn those delights which you never can share;
Not in vain does he live in Retirement's shade,
Nor in vain with the Muse hold fond intercourse there:
For the gales, on their swift-winged passage, will bear
Ev'ry note he shall utter, whose music can raise
Delight's happy smile, or draw Sympathy's tear:
And still on mankind with affection he'll gaze&mdash;
Softly whisper rebuke to their faults, but their virtues exultantly praise.

Then leave him, ye tribes that crowd Gaiety's fane,
And ye that on Fashion's trim levee attend!
He likes not your faithless and fluttering train&mdash;
When Prosperity withers, your love's at an end!
Whilst he in the Muse finds an ever-warm friend,
He envies you not in this peaceable state;
If a few worthy inmates society lend,
He minds not whom honours or riches await;
But, grant him the smiles of the good &mdash; he cares not a whit for the great.
