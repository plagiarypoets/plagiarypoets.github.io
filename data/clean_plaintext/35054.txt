RECITATIVE, BY DOUBLE VOICES.
Hail to the LYAR, whose all persuasive strain,
Waked by the master-touch of art,
And prompted by th' inventive brain,
Winds it sly way into the easy heart.

SOLO.
Hark!  do I hear the golden tone
Responsive now!  and now alone!
Or does my fancy rove?
Reason-born conviction, hence&mdash;
And frenzy-rapt be ev'ry sense,
With the Untruth I love.
Propitious fiction aid the song;
Poet and Priest to thee belong.

SEMI-CHORUS.
By thee inspir'd, e'er yet the tongue was glib
The cradled infant lisp'd the nurs'ry fib;
Thy vot'ry in maturer youth,
Pleas'd he renounced the name of truth,
And often dared the specious to defy,
Proud of th' expansive, bold, uncovered lie.

AIR.
Propitious FICTION, hear!
And smile, as erst thy father smiled
Upon his first-born child,
Thy sister dear,
When the nether shades among,
Sin from his forehead sprung.

FULL CHORUS.
Grand deluder!  arch-impostor!
Countervailing Orde and Foster!
Renown'd Divine!
The palm is thine:
Be thy name or sung or hist,
Alone it stands &mdash; CONSPICUOUS FABULIST!

RECITATIVE FOR THE CELEBRATED FEMALE SINGER FROM MANCHESTER.  SYMPHONY OF FLUTES &mdash; PIANISSIMO.
Now in cotton robe array'd
Poor manufacture, tax-lamenting maid,
Thy story heard by her devoted wheel,
Each busy-sounding spindle hush'd&mdash;

FUGUE.
Now dreading Irish rape,
Quick shifting voice and shape&mdash;

DEEP BASS, FROM BIRMINGHAM.
With visage hard, and furnace flush'd,
And black-hair'd chest, and nerve of steel,
The sex-chang'd list'ner stood
In surly pensive mood.

AIR, ACCOMPANIED WITH DOUBLE BASSOONS &amp;C.
While the promise-maker spoke
The anvil miss'd the wonted stroke;
In air suspended hammers hung,
While Pitt's own frauds came mended from that tongue.

PART OF CHORUS REPEATED.
Renown'd Divine, &amp;c.

AIR.
Soothed with the sound the priest grew vain,
And all his tales told o'er again,
And added hundreds more;
By turns to this, or that, or both,
He gave the sanction of an oath,
And then the whole foreswore.
"Truth" he sung, was toil and trouble,
"Honour but an empty bubble"&mdash;
Glocester's aged &mdash; London dying&mdash;
Poor, too poor, is simple lying!&mdash;
If the lawn be worth thy wearing,
Win, oh!  win it, by thy swearing.

FULL CHORUS REPEATED.
Grand deluder!  Arch imposter, &amp;c.

END OF PART Ist.

PART II.

RECITATIVE  ACCOMPANIED.
Enough the parents praise &mdash; see of Deceit,
The fairer progeny ascends!
Evasion, nymph of agile feet,
With half-veil'd face;
Profession, whispering accents sweet
And many a kindred Fraud attends;
Mutely dealing courtly wiles
Fav'ring nods, and hope-fraught smiles,
A fond, amusive, tutelary race
That guard the home-pledg'd faith of Kings&mdash;
Or flitting, light, on paper wings,
Speed Eastern guile across the earthly ball,
And waft it back from Windsor to Bengal.
But chiefly thee I woo, of changeful eye,
In courts y'clept Duplicity,
Thy fond looks on mine imprinting
Vulgar mortals call it squinting&mdash;
Baby, of Art and In'trest bred,
Whom, stealing to the back-stairs head,
In fondling arms &mdash; with cautious tread:
Wrinkle-twinckle Jenky bore,
To the baize-lined close door.

AIR.
Sweetest nymph, that liv'st unseen
Within that lov'd recess&mdash;
Save when the closet councils press,
And junto's speak the thing they mean;
Tell me, ever busy power,
Where shall I trace thee in that vacant hour?
Art thou content, in the sequester'd grove,
To play with hearts and vows of love?
Or emulous of prouder sway,
Dost thou to list'ning Senates take thy way;
Thy presence let me still enjoy
With Rose, and the lie-loving boy.

AIR.
No rogue that goes
Is like that Rose,
Or scatters such deceit:
Come to my breast&mdash;
There ever rest
Associate counterfeit!

PART III.

LOUD SYMPHONY.
But lo!  what throngs of rival bards!
More lofty themes!  more bright rewards!
See Salisbury a new Apollo fit!
Pattern and arbiter of wit!
The laureat wreathe hangs graceful from his wand;
Begin, he cries, and waves his whiter hand.
'Tis George's natal day&mdash;
Parnassian Pegasus away&mdash;
Grant me the more glorious steed
Of royal Brunswick breed&mdash;
I kneel, I kneel;
And at his snowy heel,
Pindarick homage vow;&mdash;
He neighs; he bounds; I mount, I fly,&mdash;
The air-drawn crosier in my eye,
The visionary mitre on my brow&mdash;
Spirit of hiearchy exalt the rhyme,
And dedicate to George the lie sublime.

AIR FOR A BISHOP.
Hither, brethren, incense bring,
To the mitre-giving king.
Praise him for his first donations
Praise him for his blest translations,
Benefices, dispensations.
By the powers of a crown,
By the many made for one,
By a monarch's awful distance,
Rights divine, and non-resistance,
Honor, triumph, glory give&mdash;
Praise him in his might,
Praise him in his height!
The mighty, mighty height of his prerogative:

RECITATIVE BY AN ARCHBISHOP.
Orchestras, of thousands strong,
With Zadoc's zeal each note prolong&mdash;
Prepare!
Prepare!
Bates gives the animating nod&mdash;
Sudden they strike &mdash; unnumbered strings
Vibrate to the best of Kings&mdash;
Eunuchs, Stentors, double bases,
Lab'ring lungs, inflated faces,
Bellows working,
Elbows jerking,
Scraping, beating,
Roaring, sweating.
Thro' the old gothic roofs the chorus rebounded,
'Till echo is deafen'd, and thunder dumb-founded,
And now another pause &mdash; and now another nod
&mdash;All proclaim a present God.
Bishops and Lords of the Bedchamber,
George submissive Britain sways;
Heavy Hanover obeys.
Proud Ierne's volunteers,
Abject Commons, prostrate Peers&mdash;
All proclaim a present God&mdash;
(On the necks of all he trod)
A present God,
A present God.
Hallelujah!
