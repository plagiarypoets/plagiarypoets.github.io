Hail solemn Fancy, prompt my mournful Song,
And with thee bring self-torturing Grief along;
Rummage the Cavern of Despair,
Bid drooping Melancholy come,
To weep o'er hapless Chloe's Tomb.
Chloe, who never fail'd, with wanton Play,
(Well pleas'd, whene'er I stroak'd her beauteous Ears)
To court my Love; she on my Lap would lay,
Free from all Dangers, unalarm'd by Fears,
The sportive Partner of each happy Day.

Where were ye Muses, when my Chloe dy'd,
How were ye then employ'd?
Ye were not near her Cushion plac'd,
Nor on the Grass-plat, where she wont to play.
Phoebus, thy Pow'r was ne'er so much disgrac'd,
As on that luckless, ill-protected Day,
When all your Force was try'd in vain!
Why, Gunnings, would you not your Tea apply?
Careful of some happy Swain,
You let poor unregarded Chloe die?

Each fragrant Flower, and ev'ry shady Grove,
Where the dear Wanton us'd to rove,
Fade, as a Mark of their departed Love!
Thou lonesome Cushion, where she us'd to lie,
No more shall she bedeck thy Crimson Dye:
Here, Muses, tho' it was not in your Pow'r
To shield her in the sad distressful Hour,
When she gave up her Breath,
Yet to her Memory plait a living Wreath,
You whose sad Accents wept at Marble-Hall,
O'er the great Suffolk's little Fav'rite's Fall.
O let your Lyres lament my Chloe gone,
With the same deep, majestic rueful Tone.
