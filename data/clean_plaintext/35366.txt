The haughs o' a' their yellow locks are cou'd,
Bauld Boreas blaws wi' nippin norland breath;
Tween neuk and neuk stackyeards are geyly stow'd,
Wi' ricks weel happit up frae comein' skaith.
And now sin labor' has secur'd wherewith
To stap the wame when winter yowls thereout,
Our auld guidman has pledg'd his sacred aith,
That he'll ha'e a' the neibours roun' about,
Baith' young and auld, ca'd in, an' hae a merry bout.

Frae yont the burn auld Symon, dais'd wi' eild,
Comes, loutin' fair, out our his aiken kent;
An' John, wha' wins aboon the hazelie beild,
As fast's he dou, comes steppin' owr' the bent.
Wi' twa three mae' douce fouk, wha' now present
Themsel' amang the younkers in the ha',
Syne' to the barn wi' meikle merriment,
When things are a' set right, they gang awa,
An' roun' the claith-clad boord sit down baith yin an' a'.

Our auld gudeman fou doucely taks his seat
At the boord' head, an' syne a blessin' gies;
That done, he bids the bashfou' no be blate,
But just win to, an' connaugh what they please.
Sax gude sheep-heads, sung i' the smiddie bleeze.
A muckle haggis weel worth a' that's there,
An monie a whang, stou'd frae the gude auld cheese,
Wi' routh o' sic' like hamely countra' fare,
Staps a their wames sae fou, that they dou haud nae mair,

Now furms are flittet an' bethankits said,
In wi' a stacherin' step comes fiddler Pate,
Wha yont the auld aik kipple flaps his plaid,
Syne i' the neuk compos'dly taks his seat.
Tarn pous' up Tibbie, Will his winsome Kate,
An' Rab his Peggie, wi' som twa three mae';
Syne our the floor reel at an unco' rate,
While Patie plays O'er Bogie we will gae,'
Or, Fy gaur rub her weel wi' wusps o' clean ait strae.

The canty crackin' carlins i' the neuk
Tell our auld warl' tales wi' meikle glee;
The auld arm chair hauds Symon's aged buik,
Wha' i' the bowie maks the spiritual brie,
Syne i' the noggin's, wi' a ladle he,
Pours forth wi' liberal hand the inspiring soup,
Round gangs the bickers for ilk ane to prie,
Till Burniewin's sae fou he's tint a' hope
O' ever wunnen' mair up aff his scour'd doup'.

Wae's me, poor Wattie's unco' fair beset;
Jock Tamson's kaitlin' wi' his dautit Jean;
An' he, poor silly fool, has taen the pet,
Because on him she winna' fling her een'.
Come play up, Wat ye wha I saw yestereen;
Crys Jock, an' syne wi' Jean jumps to the floor,
While waefou' Wattie, no weel pleas'd I ween,
To see his joe, wyld wi' a rival's lure,
Throu' spite is hameward gane awa' out our the moor.

But wha' can yon be sitten near the mou',
Among the shakeit strae weel out o' sight?
Aye, Rab, ye wylie loon', I see its you,
Wi' Peggie i' your oxter claspit tight:
O dinna' for Nell's gowd, sic beauty slight,
Nor wi' fause love fie innocence betray.
For weel I wat ye are the winsome wight;
She fain wa'd share her joys an' sorrows wi, 
Tho' she has got a bode frae Jock an' monie mae'.

Arous'd by the big punch bowie's pour,
The canty auld fock, in a merry mood,
Ha'e yin and a' gat up to fit the floor,
An wag their legs amang the junior brood.
Come, see the fiddle-strings are a' weel screw'd,
Crys John, an gies the cantiest spring ye have;
Auld aunty Margat's youth is maist reneu'd,
When shaking her auld shanks amang the lave,
Tho' her tae fit amaist is i' the dowie grave.

The floor i' now is just a hotchin' thrang,
Baith young an' auld are in a merry key;
Rib's pou'd up Symon wi' an' unco bang,
For his auld warld fling he langs to see.
Poor Leesie loupin' roun' right merrilie,
Ran soul' o' that mislear'd vile fallow Stein,
Wha' tulyeing fair her bony mou to prie,
Out o' her cotties pou'd the muckle preen,
Whilk keeps some things fou snug that dounna weel be seen.

But whist, my muse, Pate's fiddle scarce dou squeel;
Think ye the straught up stentin stick is fawn;
Na', Na', wi' him the maut's aboon the meal
For trouth he sat our near our auld gudeman.
Foul fa' the filthy loon, that I should bann,
See how he's speuing yont the muckle stool,
It maks na' tho' he i' the burn was thrawn,
Out our the lugs, the wearie heat to cool,
Whilk scouders a' the ucc frae aff his glewin' hool.

The smith's sae fou' he don but gape an' glour,
An' yet to toom his cog he maks a' fen;
Auld Pattie, too, is fairly coupit o'er,
And scarce wi' drink can wag his finger en'.
In troth, quoth Roger of the brechan' glen,
It's time we were gaun hame bath yin and a';
Content, quo' Rab, ilk yin wale out his hen;
Sae he wi' his ain Meg is gain awa'
To see her safely through the Bogle-haunted shaw.

The Gleesome fiddle is na' heard to hum,
For Pate's sae fou he canna wald the bow;
Sae a' the younkers wearied, flockin' come,
Out at the door each wi' his lass in tow.
Jock's gaen wi' Jean awa out o'er the know;
Stein's got his plaid, an's oxtering Jenny hame;
An' Will wi' Kate's gaen throu' the Goblin' howe,
While the auld carls wi' suncat rax their wame,
Ben i' the cozie spence, wi' our gudeman and dame.
