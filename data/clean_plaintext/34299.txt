Thrice happy Bard, whose Worth, whose awful Lays,
Nor fear Detraction, nor solicit Praise!
Happy!  whilst none thy Labours can rehearse
In strains immortal, as thy tuneful verse.
More lasting* Honours wait thy sacred Head;
Alive thy Numbers, tho' the Poet dead.
Nor need a MASON'S art transmit thy Name,
Thy Works themselves best sound their Maker's fame.
*Alluding to the Monody.

The Author does not mean, by the Help of a Pun, to lessen the Merit of Mr. Mason's Performance, which he thinks unexceptionable in every Respect but the Choice of his Plan; nor would that be amiss, but for the Dress it appears in.
Tho' the Works of Chaucer and Spencer, do justly entitle them to be rank'd among Poets of distinguish'd Fame; yet is it for their Language or their Sentiments, that we admire them?  If for the latter, which is most assuredly we do, pray what has Mr. Mason to do with the former? &mdash; Just as much as the young, bright, and beautiful Miss M&mdash;d&mdash;n, with her Great Grandmother's Pinners.
These Authors appear'd, whilst they wrote, in all the Pomp and Splendor of Poetry, the Language of the Times would admit of; which then, perhaps, seem'd as well suited to the Majesty of their Genius, as did the Ruff of Queen Elizabeth to that of her person. &mdash; "Sed tempora (&amp; linguag) mutantur." &mdash; Instead, therefore, of thus meanly borrowing their Dress, it would be but Justice to them and to Posterity, if we generously lent them our own.
Who can read those embellish'd Tales of Chaucer, and the no less improv'd Satires of Dr. Donne, but must admire the Piety, as well as Poetry of him, who has rescued from Oblivion, what must else have perish'd in the Ruins of an antiquated Style, and given them Immortality by a Language, we trust, will never die; 'till Time shall be no more.
