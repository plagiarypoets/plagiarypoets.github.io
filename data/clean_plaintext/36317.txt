In Fancy-Land there is a burst of wo,
The spirit's tribute to the fallen; see
On each scarr'd front the cloud of sorrow grow,
Bloating its sprightly shine.  But what is he
For whom grief's mighty butt is broach'd so free?
Were his brows shadow'd by the awful crown,
The Bishop's mitre, or high plumery
Of the mail'd warrior?  Won he his renown
On pulpit, throne, or filed, whom death hath now struck down?

He won it in the field where arms are none,
Save those the mother gives to us.  He was
A climbing star which had not fully shone,
Yet promised in his glory to surpass
Our champion star ascendant; but alas!
The sceptred shade that values earthly might,
And pow'r, and pith, and bottom, as the grass,
Gave with his fleshless fist a buffet slight;&mdash;
Say, bottle-holding Leech, why ends so soon the fight?

What boots it t' inquire? &mdash; 'Tis done.  Green mantled Erin
May weep here hopes of milling sway past by,
And Crib, sublime, no lowlier rival fearing,
Repose, sole Ammon of the fistic sky,
Conceited, quaffing his blue ruin high,
Till comes the Swell, that come to all men must,
By whose foul blows Sir Daniel low doth lie,
Summons the Champion to resign his trust,
And mingles with Kings, Slaves, Chieftains, Beggars' dust!
