When IRUS wanton'd in the Pride of Youth,
And Health, and Vigour, bless'd his blooming Days,
In love with Life, and all its flatt'ring Joys,
He labour'd to be Great:  Frequent at Courts,
And where the haughty Statesman's gilded Roof
Dazled the vulgar Eye; with constant Toil,
And long Attendance, he assiduous watch'd
The happy Moment, that should crown his Hopes,
And recompence his Cares:  So fondly broods
The frantick Chimist o'er the melting Mine,
And hourly images the dawning Gold,
Just redd'ning to the Light, where not a Spark
Should ever twinkle, nor a Grain refund
His real Treasures, wasted all in vain.

&mdash;From Day to Day, from Year to Year, a Round
Of Disappointment, Vanity, and Pain,
He kept his Hopes alive, and fancy'd still,
Some lucky Minute, would at last arrive
To ease his Woes, and lead on Fortune, gay
With softest Smiles, and rob'd in Happiness,
And Peace, and Joy; but fruitless was the Hope.&mdash;
DAN SPENCER hymns a diff'rent Song, a Song
To warn the cred'lous Soul, and gently rouze
The thoughtless Dreamer from his golden Trance.

"Most miserable Man!  whom wicked Fate
Has Shipwrecked on a Court, to sue for what
So few have found, so many never could:
How little thinks he, what a Hell of Pain,
Attends the tedious Search; to loose good Days
That might be better spent, to waste long Nights
In melancholy Thought; this time he sooth'd,
Another scorn'd; to feed on Hope, to pine
With anxious Fear; blest in his Prince's Grace,
To want the Statesman's too; granted his Wish,
To wait a Length of Years; to fret his Soul
With agonizing Care, and feel Despair,
With all her Terrors, gnawing at his Heart;
To fawn, to crouch, to wait, to ride, to run,
To spend, to give, to want, to be undone."

&mdash;Thus IRUS read, and, finding in his Soul,
The like Ideas of resembling Woes,
Grew sick of Splendour, ever in his Eye,
But never yet enjoy'd; with Horror saw
His Ruin lurking underneath the Veil
Of Titles, Honours, Wealth, and Power:  He saw,
And trembled at the View too late reveal'd;
With Penitence sincere, bewail'd his fond
Belief, and curs'd the glitt'ring Bane:  So when
The little Darling of the Mother's Breast,
Sportive and gay, persues, with eager Haste,
An airy Bubble, floating on the Wind;
He runs, he flies, to grasp the fleeting Toy,
All heedless of the Pit that yawns below,
'Till, just within his Reach, it flits in Air
Away, while sudden Downfall ends at once
His Pleasure, and his Days. &mdash; Now IRUS, wak'd
To sad Reflection of succeeding Woes,
Looks round for Succour, but looks round in vain;
No Friend, no Patron, deign'd a pitying Eye,
A friendly Heart, an helping Hand; aloof,
They gaze on his Undoing; ruthless, stern,
Embitter'd Scoffers, at so hard a Fate.
His Virtues were forgot, his Wit dispis'd,
His Person shunn'd, affronted, scorn'd, his Tears
Neglected, jeer'd his Wants, and unreliev'd
His Woes:  Those whom his sympathizing Soul,
With softest Tenderness, redeem'd from Care,
From Error, Wretchedness, and ev'ry Ill,
Ev'n those, Ingrate!  forsook him in his last,
Extream Distress, and sought a firmer Root,
A surer Shade.  At last, hopeless of Aid,
Or ev'n Compassion from so dire a Race,
From Courts, and Cities he retir'd; sought out
The wildest Heath, most unfrequented Woods,
Where Poverty resides, to be his Haunt;
There wander'd long, amid the thickest Gloom,
Avoiding Man's deceitful Face, oppress'd
With ev'ry Want, and stung with ev'ry Woe;
Despair his sole Companion, Death the Theme
Of all his melancholy Thoughts; a Cave,
Rude, rocky, dark as Night, his sad Abode;
His Food what Nature furnish'd, and his Drink
The falling Stream:  Oft from the rocky Clift
His Sorrows urg'd him to precipitate
His Fall, and often, tempted by the Flood,
That roll'd beneath; he ponder'd on the Brink,
How sharp his Woes were, yet how light the Cure.
When e'er a human Form appear'd, he fled
Away, thro' the obscurest Shade, and shunn'd
The smiling Villany; with harmless Brutes,
Alone maintain'd a dumb Society,
With soft Attractives, lur'd them to his Hand,
And taught them to alleviate his Woes.
&mdash;At Length, the Grief, that rankled in his Heart,
Assail'd the Springs of Life, and, by Degrees,
Wasted the brittle Frame away; with Joy
He ey'd th' Approach of Death, with open Arms,
Receiv'd him to his Breast, call'd him his Friend,
His Dear, his only Friend, and, in a Sigh,
Serenely breath'd his Soul to Heav'n. &mdash; Stretch'd on
His parent Earth, his ghastly Reliques lay,
To rot, and moulder in the open Air;
No pitying Hand to break the grassy Turf,
And deign with fun'ral Rite, a decent Grave;
No weeping Eye to wail his hapless End,
No tuneful Tongue to sing his genuin Praise;
Lone, in the dreary Cave, his Guardian Dog
Howl'd mournful thro' the Gloom, sad PHILOMEL,
And ev'ry warbling Bird, that us'd, with Joy,
To flutter round him, and assuage his Grief
With artless Melody; sad PHILOMEL,
And ev'ry warbling Bird, in fullest Choir,
Bewail'd him with a Note of Woe; the Clouds
Afforded Tears, and ev'ry Wind a Groan.

&mdash;It chanc'd a Peasant, wand'ring thro' the Wild,
In after Time, beheld the darksom Den,
And, with a curious Eye, approach'd t' explore
The lone Recess; when, by the twilight Glance
That pierc'd the awful Dusk, aghast he saw
The meagre Skeleton's extended Bones,
An hideous Spectacle!  all grim and bare,
Unburied, and unmourn'd!  Struck at the Sight,
With Pity, and Amazement; long he stood
In Tears, resolving what a Round of Ill
That luckless Wretch must know (for Tenderness,
And soft Humanity had smooth'd his Soul,
And made him apt to mourn) then to the Light,
Restoring the deserted Course, beneath
Th' impending Rock, with pious Toil, upturn'd
The restive Marl, and dug an homely Grave;
When, lo!  amid the reeking Soil, appear'd
An Hoard of Treasures, that, for Ages, lay
Conceal'd below; with grateful Eye, he view'd
The canker'd Mass; then, gazing on the Skies,
Exclaim'd, Good Heav'n!  thy Providence is just;
Who feels Compassion for another's Woe,
Shall have his own reliev'd, &mdash; a nobler Urn,
Lamented Shade!  shall now inshrine thy Bones,
And all thy Virtues live upon thy Tomb.
