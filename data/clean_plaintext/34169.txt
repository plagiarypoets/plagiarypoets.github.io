Let NEWTON, pure intelligence, whom GOD
To Mortals lent, to trace his boundless Works
From Laws sublimely simple, speak thy Fame
In all Philosophy.  For lofty Sense,
Creative Fancy, and Inspection keen
Thro' the deep Windings of the human Heart,
Is not wild SHAKESPEAR thine and Nature's Boast?
Is not each great, each amiable Muse
Of Classic Ages in thy MILTON met?
A Genius universal as his Theme,
Astonishing as Chaos, as the Bloom
Of blowing Eden fair, as Heaven sublime.
Nor shall my Verse, that elder Bard forget,
The gentle SPENSER, Fancy's pleasing Son;
Who, like a copious River, pour'd his Song
O'er all the Mazes of enchanted Ground:
Nor Thee, his antient Master, laughing Sage,
CHAUCER, whose native Manners-painting Verse
Well-moraliz'd, shines thro' the Gothic cloud
Of Time and Language o'er thy Genius thrown. . . .
