These have been glorious, &mdash; are so still, and we,
Perchance, with other nations, may go down,
Though not unspotted, to posterity:
For Albion has high names, that give renown
To her, &mdash; unfading jewels to her crown,
That bore her glory o'er the wave afar;
The proudest nations trembled at their frown&mdash;
Gods of the ocean, thunderbolts of war,
From old Hispania's scourge to him of Trafalgar.

Hampden, and Sydney, Raleigh, Spencer, Gower,
The mighty Magian and immortal pair,
Our own blind bard, of poesy the flow'r,
Gray, Butler, Erin's minstrel, minds that were
All matchless in their line, and who will bear
And bid her name to future ages bloom;
Thomson, M'Pherson, Ramsay, Burns, and Blair,
Robertson, Smollett, Beattie, Scott, and Hume,
With him to whom as yet his country gives no tomb.

With others, equal in their lustre, whom
Our craving eyes would almost wish to see,
Bursting the dull cold fetters of their tomb,
Before us stand in all their majesty.
Fond, but vain wish, alas!  that ne'er can be!
Great as they were, their names alone remain
For us t' admire, and our posterity
To rev'rence, when from this world we are ta'en
To lay our fading dust, perchance, where their's has lain.
