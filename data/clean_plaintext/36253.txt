On Shinah's plain, where David's gem appeared,
The star that walked yon bright serene alone,
Whose mystic ray the Bethlehem shepherds cheered
While angel-bands in blest effulgence shone,
With radiance flaming from the ethereal throne;
On Shinah's plain, where Siloa's fountains rise,
Whose murmuring stream glides mournful now, and lone,
The holy pilgrim from afar descries
The Tomb of JESUS, &mdash; Lord Supreme of earth and skies.

'Twas there the Ancient of eternal Day,
The blest Immanuel, slumbered in the grave!
He whose right arm enclothed with awful sway,
To countless worlds their form and being gave
When chaos reigned, and shoreless was the wave!
'Tis hallowed ground &mdash; proclaim it not! &mdash; for there
Is crime! &mdash; Calvary, polluted by the Islam slave,
A scathing curse for him will wrath prepare,
And bolts in heaven for those who the dark traffick share!

Oh soon may Shiloh bless the fated land,
The unhallowed crescent there be seen no more;
The lawless wanderer, with Arabia's band,
Forsake their prophet, and the cross adore;
While songs of joy resound on Jordan's shore,
Soon may the banner of our Jesus wave
On glittering heights where lofty minarets soar;
Nations confess that He who died to save,
The blest Messiah, lives and reigns for evermore!
