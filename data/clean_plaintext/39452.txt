The Day returns, &mdash; the festive Day,
When Hymen to the rural Fane
His youthful Fav'rites led away,
To share and sooth each other's pain:
To make the tide of Rapture roll
Serenely o'er th' enamour'd Soul
Where Purity and wedded Love combine,
Its deathless Pow'rs to train to happiness divine.

The Nymphs beheld with envious eye,
Fair EMMA to her DAMON giv'n;
The Swains suppress'd the hopeless sigh
For EMMA, fairest gift of heav'n:
But, Nymphs and Swains!  nor more repine;
For You, soon Hymen's torch shall shine
In smiling splendor from the realms above,
To light you to the Bow'r of soft connubial Love.

Then, like the Worth-ennobled Pair
Who now receive the Muse's meed,
May your defence from ev'ry care
Be ev'ry just and gen'rous deed!
For Heav'n delights such deeds to bless,
Nor, long will suffer fell distress
To wring the heart where Virtue rears her throne,
Rules with benignant sway, and makes its wants her own.

Long may her pow'r avert each harm,
And gain from Heav'n each mild decree,
Preserve them from each rude alarm,
And bid them happy happy be!
Long may their darling blooming Boys
Prove to their breast a source of Joys,
Bless them thro' Youth and Age till Life be o'er,
And meet their fond embrace, on heav'n's eternal shore.
