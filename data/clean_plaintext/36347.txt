I thought of witcheries of olden dayes&mdash;
Of shaggy satyrs with the cloven heel,
And clashing cymbals &mdash; of the drunken reel,
Of Bacchanals &mdash; of merry making fays&mdash;
Of branching forests, which from the suns rays
Shade tender flowers, where in some cool retreat,
They shed their hidden beauty, at the feet
Of huge Oak trees; of shepherd's simple lays&mdash;
Of nymphs unseen, save by their sylvan wooers;&mdash;
Of tinkling rills &mdash; of courteous knights, the doers
Of proud deeds, warring with enchanters curst;&mdash;
And with this pleasing dream, by Fancy nurst;&mdash;
Then Spenser!  did I think of thee, who such tales told,
Sounding like springs from mossy caverns old.
