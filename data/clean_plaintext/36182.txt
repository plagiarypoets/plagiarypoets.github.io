Clothed in a splendid garb of green and gold,
Her blue eyes beaming beautiful and bright,
Radiant and rich, and lovely to behold,
Majestic Summer mounts her throne of light.
Exulting Nature hails the auspicious sight,
And all her tuneful tribes their homage pay&mdash;
Even cheerful looks the mountain's barren height,
And every valley, pranked with flowrets gay,
Breaths exquisite perfumes that zephyr wafts away.

O come, my Friend &mdash; where yonder crystal stream
Meanders cool beneath the willow shade,
Now let us saunter &mdash; shun the sultry beam,
And court the breeze that flutters through the glade.
From every bough, with mingled serenade,
The feather'd choir regale the listening ear,
And buzzing insects ply their busy trade,
Collecting timely store for future cheer,
When chilling storms again shall blast the drooping year.

And see!  the blooming hawthorn to her bower
Up yonder verdant slope, our visit woos,
When down the west bright day's departing power,
Paints every passing cloud with brilliant hues;
Opening still varied and delightful views,
To charm the curious eye, on every side&mdash;
'Tis Summer's invitation to the Muse,
While Nature spreads her sumptuous table wide,
And o'er the sweet repast bids lovely Eve preside.

Can'st thou the rapture such a scene inspires
Suppress in silence?  no!  thy sparkling eye
Tells me thou can'st not, ere the nascent fires
Of Feeling from thy lip permit reply.
Then seize the lyre, and wake its melody
In concert with the warblers all around,
And chaunt the beauties of earth, air, and sky,
Till Echo, starting from her steep profound,
Catch the ecstatic notes, and rock and cave resound.
