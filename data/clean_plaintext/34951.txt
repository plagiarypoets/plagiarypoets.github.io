This is the day, fair LYDIA'S natal day,
When my impotent Muse would strike the lyre,
The long half-sleeping lyre assume the lay,
And sing her matchless charms with glowing fire:
Nor think, fair LYDIA, that she flatt'ry joins,
To swell her feeble verse, and empty sounding lines.

Sure worth like thine a loftier Muse requires,
Far nobler strains should thy desert proclaim;
For ev'ry virtue, ev'ry grace conspires,
To raise thy merit, and extol thy fame,
Thy beauty, equall'd only by the charms
Thy mind diffuses round, and ev'ry bosom warms.

Adorn'd with ev'ry noble &mdash; useful art,
That adds bright lustre to the female form,
Plain truth, and genuine goodness warm thy heart,
Thy chearful smile would fiercest rage disarm:
These, these are ornaments which never fade,
Unsullied these remain, when Beauty's charms are fled.

Thy presence, now, makes glad this happy plain,
Far from the haunts of Luxury and Pride,
Where chearful Mirth, and social Converse reign,
Where smiling Plenty swells the jovial tide:
Where first the sun's enliv'ning beams did shine,
On LYDIA'S beauteous form, with energy divine.

The circling year rolls on with rapid speed,
The fleeting moments fly; this happy day
Will soon be past, another soon succeed,
When added lustre thou shalt then display:
A loftier Muse shall then thy virtues sing,
For ever blooming fresh with an eternal spring.
