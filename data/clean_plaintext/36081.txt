O LIBERTY!  firm friend of human kind!
Who bind'st more closely life's domestic ties;
With independence elevat'st the mind,
And bid'st the nations unto glory rise!
Oh!  lov'd of all the good and all the wise,
In early Greece and mighty Rome ador'd,
Arise!  and with thy presence glad mine eyes,
That I may see thee to mankind restor'd,
Whose thraldom Virtue has so oft deplor'd,
Wilder'd and weary on their earthly way,
Victims of many a fell despotic lord,&mdash;
In peace their helots, and in war their prey,&mdash;
Who'd have, enrob'd with purple and with gold,
Mankind, God's image, in their forms behold!
