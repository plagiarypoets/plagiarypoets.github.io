WOMAN.
What news &mdash; what news &mdash; O Traveller!
What tidings of the fight?
I have been watchful all day long&mdash;
I watch'd all yester'night.
No Traveller has past this way&mdash;
No tidings reach'd mine ear;
And I have watch'd, and watch'd for news,
'Till I am sick with fear.

TRAVELLER.
'Tis done &mdash; the victory is gain'd;
And I past thro' Bosworth town,
And in a cart his carcase saw
Who lately wore a Crown.
I heard the Conqu'ror's army make
With shouts the welkin ring:
I heard the clamours that proclaim'd
Young Richmond England's King.

WOMAN.
Oh!  tell me, tell me, Traveller,
If you a Youth have seen&mdash;
A comely Youth in Richmond's host,
Array'd in Kendal green?

TRAVELLER.
Many a gallant Warrior there,
And comely, I have seen;
There's many a Youth in Richmond's host
Array'd in Kendal-green.

WOMAN.
His eye is black &mdash; so black and bright!
His raven locks are long,
And he is one you could not chuse
But notice 'mid the throng.

TRAVELLER.
Beneath a helm I could not see
His raven locks so long;
And sooth to say I did not stay
To gaze amid the throng;
I just beheld young Richmond pass,
And then I hasten'd on.

WOMAN.
Dead!  dead!  oh God!  he must be dead!
Or sure this could not be!
He would have ask'd you where you went,
That he might send to me:
He would have let no Traveller
Now pass unquestion'd by;
For well he knows how I should watch,
And wait in agony.

TRAVELLER.
Cheer up!  cheer up!  and take good hope,
I did but hurry by;
And like it is that he might not
A single Trav'ller spy.
Cheer up!  cheer up!  and hope the best,
And spare these hasty tears;
A little while, and he may come,
And you forget your fears.

WOMAN.
Oh!  tell me, Trav'ller, did you pass
Across the bloody plain&mdash;
And did you see no comely Youth
Like him among the slain?

TRAVELLER.
Many a comely Youth I saw
Upon that bloody plain;
Many a groaning wretch I heard
Half dead amid the slain:
Christ grant that may never see
So sad a sight again!

WOMAN.
You saw him &mdash; yet you will not tell:
You saw him &mdash; he is dead!
O!  tell me &mdash; tell me &mdash; any thing
Were better than this dread!

TRAVELLER.
I hasten'd o'er the hateful plain,
And saw the suff'rer there.
Take comfort &mdash; I will, as I go,
Remember you in pray'r.
