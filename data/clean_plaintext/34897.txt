As with affection fond, a mother views
Her infant race, and melts with conscious joy;
On the girl's cheek she oft' the kiss renews,
Or to her bosom strains the beauteous boy.
Some climb, with eager love, her envy'd knees;
Some at her feet in childish frolic play;
Their secret wish the raptur'd mother sees,
From the sweet smiles, the gestures they display:
And as she marks each varied face, bestows
A tender look on these, and gentle speech on those.

Yet, if displeasure's frown her brow shou'd wear,
She's still the mother, and her child befriends:
So Providence all-wise, with parent care,
Provides for some, to others comfort lends;
To all who ask, she lib'ral aid supplies,
To ev'ry suppliant lends a willing ear;
And if sometimes her kindness she denies,
'Tis only to extort the grateful pray'r:
Nay, by denying oft' our ill-tim'd wants,
Refusal is consent, and all our wish she grants.
