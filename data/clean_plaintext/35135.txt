In SPRING of life, our early Friendship sprung,
With tender root, for yet the plant was young;
And may it still, with thriving vigour grow,
Nor the chill blast of cold indiff'rence know:
I fear not strife or envy, hateful words!
Heav'n roots them out, which strews fair Friendship's virtuous seeds.

In youth's warm SUMMER, in the heat of toil,
And worldly care, when scorpion passions broil;
Whether the load of bus'ness press the soul,
Or love, which reason seldom can controul,
Still may the ceaseless stream of Friendship flow,
Our wearied minds refresh and quench the rage of woe.

And, when the AUTUMN of our days draws near,
When our fond homes domestic cares endear,
Retir'd from bustle and each vain pursuit,
Then we'll enjoy fair Friendship's grateful fruit,
Ripen'd by time, its sweets increas'd, each day,
In one continu'd course and never to decay.

And, last when WINTRY age comes on, apace,
Presents his feeble form and furrow'd face,
With virtue arm'd, we'll meet th' approach of Death,
Take one farewell and calmly yield our breath;
And, may Almighty Mercy grant my pray'r,
We'll meet again in heav'n, for ever freed from care.
