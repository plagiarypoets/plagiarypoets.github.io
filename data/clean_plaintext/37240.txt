What Friendly muse will teach my Lays
To emulate the Roman fire?
Justly to sound a Caesar's praise
Demands a bold Horatian Lyre:
Yet, tho' unworthy I attempt the task,
Inspired by Loyalty, no other Muse I ask.

Hail, ever Hail, Auspicious Day!
O Long to Britain welcome rise!
Lo!  sweetest Flow'rs perfume the way,
Lo!  softest Music glads the skies.
Give all the flowing hours to Gay Delight!
Let Comus rule the Day, and Bacchus Crown the Night.

And now the Fields are deck'd with flowers;
The Trees, in Green array appear:
See!  Spring prepares the Nuptial bowers,
The fairest Portion of the Year.
Enjoy, O Royal Pair, each Nuptial Bliss
Thrice Happy be this Spring, and every Spring like This.

And if the Muse may humbly dare,
To raise the Hymeneal strain;
Far Higher wishes I'd prefer,
Nor are the Muses wishes vain.
O PRINCE, may England's Glory fill thy Soul,
Edward's and Henry's fame, within thy Bosom roll!

O might I rise on Pindar's wing,
In Strains to modern Bards unknown,
Thy virtues and thy arts I'd sing,
And all that Dignifies a Throne.
But Cold my numbers, and my fancy Dead:
The British Lyre's unstrung, Now Prior's muse is fled.

But whither roves th' ambitious Rhyme?
Venus and Cupid seem to chide.
Fair PRINCESS of the German Clime!
Or, shall I say, fair British Bride!
Wisdom thy Choice, and pleasure be thy Fate!
Be like Maria Good, Like Carolina Great!
