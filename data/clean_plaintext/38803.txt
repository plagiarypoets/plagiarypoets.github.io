Nature, thy genial call I hear,
Which wakes the Morn and me,
And seems to strike upon my ear,
Though deaf to all but Thee:
To me the hours in silence roll away;
No Music greets the dawn, or mourns the close of day.

To me, the Sky-larks pois'd aloft,
In silence seem to play;
And hail no more in warblings soft
The rising dawn of day;
For me in vain they swell their liquid throats,
Contemplative I muse, nor heed their jocund notes.

To me the Shepherd pipes in vain,
In vain the Milk-maid sings;
Lost are the bleatings of the plain,
The gurgling of the springs:
No more I hear the Nightingale complain,
When to the moon she chaunts her sad love-labour'd strain.

And when with me Lucinda strays
Along the breezy grove,
In transports on her charms I gaze,
And think she talks of love:
Ah, cease, dear Maid, to talk of love in vain;
Thy smiles alone to me the voice of Love explain.

Pygmalian thus, when he survey'd
The work his hand has form'd,
Enamour'd, wish'd to see the Maid
With mutual passion warm'd;
And as he woo'd, his ear he oft inclin'd,
Whilst yet no voice of Love reliev'd his anxious mind.

Whence these complaints?  Methinks e'en now
The voice of Reason cries,
Dispel the gloom that clouds thy brow,
Suppress thy heaving sighs:
What Fate decrees 'tis folly to bewail,
Weigh then the Good and Ill in Wisdom's equal scale.

No more in Friendship's thin disguise
Shall Flatt'ry sooth thine ear;
Experienc'd kindness makes thee wise
To know thy friend sincere:
No more shalt thou attend to Faction's cries,
The taunts of jealous Pride, or Envy's blasting lies.

No more shall now thy mind be tost
By every breath of Praise;
No more thy Reason shall be lost
In Controversy's maze:
Thou safe, thro' Life's sequester'd vale shalt go,
And learn from Nature's works her wise decrees to know.
