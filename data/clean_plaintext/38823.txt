Hail, ancient Pile!  within whose Moss-grown Cells
Erst the pale Virgins spent the Midnight Hours;
Mistaken Zeal! &mdash; With Grief my Bosom swells,
That to the Lamp should droop such op'ning Flowers,
Form'd of Man's Heart to make the purest Joy,
And prove God's great Behest &mdash; "increase and multiply."

Again all hail! &mdash; that Nature now resumes
Her genial Reign! &mdash; Monastic Vice no more
Pollutes these vainly-consecrated Rooms:&mdash;
But o'er yon ivy'd Walls the Night Birds soar;
And the pale Moon supplies the Taper's Light,
Nor Sighs, nor sorrowing Chants, disturb the peaceful Night.

Thy tyrant Arm, capricious Henry!  drew
The pamper'd Votaries from these Bigot Scenes;
In lucky Rage, their mystick Shrines o'erthrew,
And to thy Crown annex'd their rich Demesnes.
Thro' the wide Portals rush'd the Virgin Train,
And here, Despair no more sustains her black Domain.

So in old Times, fast in a brazen Tower
Immers'd beneath the baleful Yew-Trees' Shade,
Victim to Spells, and fascinating Power,
To Guilt averse, lay some enchanted Maid;
'Till her brave Knight to Love and Virtue true,
Redeem'd his long-lost Prize and the fell Paynim slew.

But crush not, Time, with thy all withering Hand
These verdant Relicts yet for Ages hence;
Let them in British Art unrival'd stand,
A Monument of sculptur'd Excellence;
To them, e'en Attick Elegance shall bow,
And all the boasted Fanes, Ilyssus!  on thy Brow.

Should to these Shades some faithful Lovers stray
By Love's best Food, indulgent Silence, led;
Haply, some Virgins 'wailing Ghost may say,
"Fly hence, 'tis Slavery's Seat, Religion's dread,
With Rapture pluck the Fruit God's Hand hath given
That Path's alone the surest and the best to Heav'n."
