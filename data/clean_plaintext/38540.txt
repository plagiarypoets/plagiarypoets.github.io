O thou, the tutelary Queen of Song!
Who in the breast where sorrow sits enthron'd,
Canst wake the throb of joy,
Etherial Fancy hail!

Coy nymph!  who, far from human turmoil, lov'st
In sylvan glens embosom'd, oft to list
The hum of insect worlds,
The jubilee of groves!

Thou too, who lov'st, in mildly pensive mood
To gaze upon the rosy-tinted clouds,
That o'er the heaven's blue vault
In pomp of beauty float:

Or, with wild florets garlanding thy brows,
To tune thy shell beside some murmuring brook,
The while its glassy stream
Mirrors thy lovely form!

By thee inspir'd, the shrill-ton'd lark, upborne
E'e to the saffron portals of the east,
Of wildest minstrelsy
A strain preluding pours;

What time the sunbeams, ushering new-born day,
O'er the horizon roll a sea of fire,
And gleams each spray, each leaf,
With myriad gems of dew.

And when gay sandal'd eve (nymph dear to thee!)
O'er the fair landscape draws her gradual veil,
When nature in soft sleep
Seems willing to repose;

By thee inspir'd the lovelorn Philomel,
Hailing th' approach of night, her sole compeer!
To scenes fast fading bids
A plaintive, sweet adieu!

But chief, the hallow'd Bard's enthusiast soul,
By thee, O Fancy!  in delirium rapt,
Thy harmonizing power,
Thy thrilling influence owns!

When now no more the vernal season charms,
Nor summer breezes sport amid the glades;
But nature wails with tears
Her countless offspring dead,

And the fell genius of the wintry storm
Through shatter'd woodlands speeds his dread career,
His breath &mdash; congealing frost,
His robe &mdash; a sable cloud;

He then, how blest, whose labouring bosom heaves
With thy coelestial presence!  Thou canst spread
Around the joyless waste
A visionary spring!

If that a mortal's prayer be heard by thee,
May I e'er bend a votary at thy shrine!
O through my early song
The soul of music breathe!
