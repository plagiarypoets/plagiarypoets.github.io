Thro' every period of Life's fleeting day
Some different passion fills the breast,
From morn till night Hope leads astray,
Nor ever guides us to the port of rest:
Love's visionary joys inflame
Youth's eager wishes; next Ambition's rage
Presents, in man's maturer stage, 
Prospects of power and fame;
Old age comes tottering last, unnerv'd and cold,
Grasping with palsied hand his ponderous bag of gold.

The raptur'd Poet deems his earliest praise
To Fancy, sweet enchantress, due;
Amidst whose trackless groves he strays,
While fresh creations strike his dazzled view:
But soon the flowers of Genius fade,
And bold Invention in her mid career
Feels, like Ithuriel's wondrous spear,
Dread Envy's fangs pervade
Her frail contexture with a ghastly wound
Or sinks an Icarus plung'd in the vast profound;

Unless, O Goddess of the furrow'd brow,
Thy admonitions stay her flight,
And urge her first t' address her vow,
Where thy pale shrine emits a glimmering light:
Too long, unmindful of thy power,
In Fiction's airy palaces I trod;
At length, observant of thy nod,
To thee I kneel; O shower
Thy dews impregnated with heavenly rest,
And let thy leaden mace fall weightier on my breast.

Thee the recluse Philosopher, whose frame
Shrinks at each northern blast, reveres;
Elixirs his attention claim,
And warmest flannels huddle up his ears:
Nor art thou distant from the Maid
Whose unsought chastity maintained its hold
While o'er her forty suns have roll'd;
Yet anxious for thy aid,
On thee she calls, whene'er before her eyes
Hibernian beaux or too resistless coronets rise.

Swift rush the fiery steeds, loud sounds the car,
When Homer brings, severely just,
Assembling Demi-gods to war,
And lays proud Troy's adulterous towers in dust:
Had Menelaus search'd thy laws,
He there had learnt without an augur's skill
That women stray not 'gainst their will,
And, loth to furnish cause
To Peleus for his slaughter'd son to chide,
Had wisely staid at home and sought another bride.

Who from thy fount his inspiration draws
Describes no Paladins in arms,
Nor paints, to gain the crowd's applause,
Armida's wiles, or Una's heavenly charms;
Nor lifts a Fairfax to the skies,
In Freedom's devious mazes led astray;
But haunts some courtly shrine, to pay
His duteous sacrifice;
Or sings in Tusser's stile of golden grain,
Of harrows, oxen, carts, and all the schemes of gain.

Since my green years, by some unhallow'd strain,
Have made thee frown upon my suit;
Not where the snarling critic train
Fierce as a dragon guard fair learning's fruit,
Nor in the busy walks of trade;
Nor will I seek thee brooding o'er thy store,
Behind the Miser's churlish door,
Worn to a meagre shade;
Nor in yon stalls, where th' orthodox divine.
Snores, and with ven'son cramm'd extends his brawny chine.

But to the regions of the Lunar sphere
My daring passage will I wing,
Where all things lost by mortals here,
Are found, if rightly Ariosto sing:
There haply, in some lonesome vale,
Where dark yews bending froth the rocky steep
O'erhang the lake, whose waters sleep
Mov'd by no ruffling gale,
Shall I behold thee weeping o'er the tomb
Of Cassius, harshly charg'd with Freedom's timeless doom:

Vanquish'd, he rais'd to heaven his haggard eyes,
And bar'd his bosom to the stroke;
Calm gown-men say, "Had be been wise,
And lived, Rome yet had scap'd Octavius' yoke."
Next, in thy shades, a prey to grief,
Perchance the learn'd Christina may I see,
On earth who proudly slighted thee;
Now, lost beyond relief,
On Papal snares and venal Poets frown,
And wait with fruitless plaints her abdicated crown.

Yet since from death thou canst not these unbind,
Their greatness claims no second birth,
To penitence incline thy mind,
And deign to waft me back again to earth;
Guarded by thee from every snare,
So shall I frame secure my placid lay;
Or, if in Satire's walks I stray,
With tutelary care
Arrest her vengeful arm just raised to strike,
Smiling on friends, and foes, and all mankind alike.
