The heart is melted by the tragic muse,
She points the dagger, fills the poisoned bowl,
And all the passions which the mind confuse,
Which rage in troubled breasts without controul,
Which cloud the brow and harrow up the soul,
She brings with frowns of darkness on the stage,
Black revenge, and hatred's angry scowl,
Burns with wild fury, which no smiles assuage,
And foams and frets with deep and deadly rage.

By her we see guilt in its wiles ensnared,
And virtue rise with bright unclouded beam,
We view the arm of dreadful justice bared,
Of hatred vice, and blasts the dark laid scheme,
The wicked demon startles from his dream
And looks around, with terror-sparkling eyes,
And sees of light, a radiant, splendid stream,
Then blinded with its rays, in wild surprise
Sinks down to shades of gloom, ne'er more to rise.
