I have a rose of thine; unseen it fell
From the rich clusters of thy glossy hair,
Upon a night which I remember well,
And I have kept it with a miser's care,
A relic, for idolatrous despair
To gaze on, 'till to nature's feelings true,
My earth found something oft reviving there
Too like its youthful freshness, ere' it knew
The curse that wither'd, and the blight that threw
All its affections into shade and gloom.
Oh with such thoughts, what have I now to do,
It were as tho' the flowers of spring should bloom
On Autumn's bosom, virtuous Lady, no!
'Tis not a crime to feel, but what I feel to show.
