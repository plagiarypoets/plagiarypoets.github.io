Now sinks the blushing god of parting day,
And westerly clouds with golden splendour stream,
And forward crowd, as 'twere to catch the ray,
That lingers on his last and loveliest beam;
How regular and radiant do they seem!
And pensive evening, from the eastern sky,
Softens the fire of day-light's flaring gleam
With sombre shadows &mdash; to the mind-fraught eye,
More sacred and more sweet than morning's richest dye.

The evening walk, how pure and pleasing!  See
The sportive children crowd the hamlet green:
The circling elders mark the playful glee,
And proudly tell of times when they had been,
And famous feats and fortunes they had seen;
The squatted dames deal village scandal round,
In council grave; the sly girl eyes the scene
Of striving youths, to catch the sight, the sound
Of him for whom her heart's best purest beatings bound.

Now day recedes, and modest twilight spreads
Her veil of darkness o'er the blushing skies,
Through which the waking night, soft peeping, sheds
The twinkling radiance of ten thousand eyes
On air's blue page the seal of silence;
Repose, on earth, has laid her hushing wing;
Tired Ocean sleeps, nor hears the soft sad sighs
Of wooing winds; the world seems slumbering;&mdash;
So motionless and mute each dead and living thing!
