Wide spreading o'er the purpl'd east,
See where yon crimson ensign bends:
Prepare!  prepare!  th' ambrosial feast,
For lo!  the God of gods descends,
But how, O nature!  wilt thou bear the load,
Or meet the splendours of a coming God?
In vain I ask &mdash; for now yon parting sky
Proclaims th' eternal triumph nigh:
Stand fast, thou earth,
For since thy birth,
Thy stedfast pillars never bore
Th' intolerable weight of DEITY before.

But hark! &mdash; methinks some softer strains,
Than ever shook th' eternal plains,
Since time began to roll,
Melts in mine ears,
Dispels my fears,
And sweeps away my soul.
'Tis Gabriel's voice, (I know the sound)
And mercy smiles to day;
Let angels shout!  let earth resound!
For God assumes our clay.

And see!  in token of supernal grace,
The angry ensign disappears;
Ten thousand milder glories fill the space,
And music wakes the spheres:
Harmonious thro' the realms above
One gen'ral concert rings,
And all the burthen of the song is love,
Love!  braces all the strings.
Astonish'd angels view the scene,
And (curious) fain would know,
What all this world of wonders!  mean;
These mysteries below?&mdash;
In vain they pry &mdash; the boundless scheme, O!  man,
For thee!  was laid, 'ere time began:
For thee!  before all worlds were fram'd,
Or angels hymn'd th' eternal THREE,
The Council sat &mdash; the terms were nam'd,
And MERCY fix'd on Thee:

And lo!  the period mark'd in heav'n&mdash;
The day that crowns Creation's birth
Is now arriv'd &mdash; the promis'd CHILD is given,
And GOD inhabits earth;
Angels applauding!  clap their golden wings,
While Bethlehem receives the King of Kings!
For this!  let rocks, and hills, and plains,
(Unpractis'd yet to vocal strains)
For once their silence break:
While man! &mdash; but man can never tell,
The grateful thoughts his breast should swell,
Nor half his raptures speak&mdash;
Silence, perhaps, may more expressive prove,
And heav'n accept the heart dissolv'd in love.
