Still anxious for his country's good, he knew
No danger of mistake; he felt it true,
That Happiness and Virtue are the same,
And only flourish in fair Freedom's soil;
And never ceas'd his unremitting toil
To fence the precious Eden where they grew,
From all its foes:  worst foes are feigned friends:
These he discern'd, howe'er disguis'd they came,
Whether in sable stoles, staid Wisdom's hue,
Or spotless white, the robes of Innocence;
He pluck'd their masks, and strait confess'd to view,
Stood mad Ambition, sordid Avarice,
Fear, at her shadow scar'd, Submission mean,
Malice and fell Revenge. . . .
