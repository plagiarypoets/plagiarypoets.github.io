Shout, warriors, shout, that Spain is free,
Your voice shall reach the flying foe,
The thund'ring sounds of victory
Shall fill their coward souls with woe!
Panic-struck the murderers fly,
Trampled in dust their bloody eagles lie;
Shame now pursues, where desolation led,
And Spain, victorious Spain, has conquered while she bled.
