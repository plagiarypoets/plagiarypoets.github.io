THE ARGUMENT.
Technis complaines,
And labours to display
Th' unjust distaste
Of Amarillida.

THE SECOND ARGUMENT.
Here relates this forlorne Swaine
How he woo'd, but woo'd in vaine,
Her whose beautie did surpasse
Shape of any Country Lasse,
Made more to delight the bed,
Than to see her Lambkins fed;
Yet poore Shepheard see his fate,
Love shee vow'd, is chang'd to hate:
For being jealous of his love,
Shee her fancie doth remove,
Planting it upon a Groome,
Who by Cupids blindest doome
Is preferd unto those joyes,
Which were nere ordain'd for Boyes:
On whose face nere yet appear'd
Downie shew of manly beard.
Having thus drunke sorrows cup,
First, he shewes his bringing up,
What those Arts were he profest,
Which in homely style exprest,
He descends unto the Swaine
Whom he sought by love to gaine,
But prevented of his ayme,
Her he showes, but hides her shame.

THE SHEPHEARDS.
TECHNIS.  DYMNUS.
DORYCLES.  CORYDON.
SAPPHUS.  LINUS.

Why now I see these Plaines some good afford,
When Shepherds will be masters of their word.

DORYCLES.
Yes, Technis yes, we see it now and then
That they'le keep touch as wel as greater men,
Who can protest and take a solemn vow
To doe farre more then they intend to doe.

DYMNUS.
Stay Dorycles, me thinkes thou goest too farre,
Lets talke of Shepheards, as we Shepheards are:
For why should we these Great mens errors note,
But learne unto our Cloth to cut our coat.

SAPPHUS.
Dynmus, 'tis true; we came not to display
Great mens abuses, but to passe away
The time in Tales, wherein we may relate
By one and one our blest or wretched state.

CORYDON.
Indeed friend Dymnus therfore came we hither,
So shew our Fortune and distresse together.

LINUS.
Proceede then Technis, you'r the eldest Swaine
That now feeds Flocks upon this fruitfull Plaine:
So as your age, whatsever we alledge,
Doth well deserve that proper priviledge.

TECHNIS.
As to begin;

LINUS.
So Technis doe I meane.

TECHNIS.
Thanks Shepherds heartily, that you will daine
A haplesse Swaine such grace; which to requite,
Ile mix my dolefull Storie with delight,
That while yee weepe for griefe, I may allay
Your discontent, and wipe your teares away.

DORYCLES.
On Technis on, and weele attention lend,
And wish thy love may have a happie end.

DYMNUS.
Which shone, each shall reply, and make exprest
When all is done, whose fate's the heaviest.

TECHNIS.
Attend then Shepheards, now I doe begin,
Shewing you first where I had nurturing,
Which to unfold the better, I will chuse
No other words then home-spun Heardsmen use.
First then, because some Shepheards may suppose
By meere conjecture, I am one of those
Who had my breeding on this flowrie Plaine,
I must confesse that they are much mista'ne,
For if I would, I could strange stories tell
Of Platoes and of Aristotles Well,
From whence I drain'd such drops of divine wit,
As all our Swaines could hardly dive to it:

DORYCLES.
Indeed I've heard much of thee in thy youth.

TECHNIS.
Yes Dorycles, I say no more than truth.
A Prentiship did I in Athens live,
Not without hope but I might after give
Content and comfort where I should remaine,
And little thought I then to be a Swaine:
For I may say to you, I then did seeme
One of no small or popular esteeme,
But of consort with such, whose height of place
Advanced me, because I had their grace:
Though now, since I my lambkins gan to feede,
Clad in my russet coat and countrey weede,
Those broad-spred Cedars scarce aford a nest
Upon their shadie Boughes, where I may rest.

SAPPHUS.
It seemes they're great men Technis.

TECHNIS.
So they are,
And for inferiour groundlins, little care.
But may they flourish:  thus much I am sure,
Though Shrubs be not so high, they're more secure.

LINUS.
High rates indeed are subject to decline.

TECHNIS.
Yes Linus yes, in this corrupted time
We may observe by due experience
That where a Person has preeminence,
He so transported growes, as he will checke
Jove in his Throne, till Pride has broke his necke,
Whereas so vertuous were precedent times,
As they were free not only from the crimes
To which this age's exposed, but did live
As men which scorn'd Ambition.

DYMNUS.
Now I dive
Into thy meaning Technis; thou do'st grieve
That those who once endeer'd thee, now should leave
Thy fellowship.

TECHNIS.
Nay Dymnus I protest
I never credited what they profest;
Nor should I grieve to see a surly Lout,
Who for observance casts his eye about;
In nothing meriting, save only He
Is rich in acres, to disvalue me?

DORYCLES.
No Technis no, th' art of a higher spirit
Than these inferiour Gnats, whose only merit
Consists in what they have, not what they are.

TECHNIS.
No Dorycles, for these I little care,
Nor ever did:  though some there be that feede
On such mens breath.

DYMNUS.
Good Technis now proceed.

TECHNIS.
Having thus long continued, as I said,
And by my long continuance Graduate made,
I tooke more true delight in being there,
Than ever since in Court or Country ayre.

SAPPHUS.
Indeed minds freedome best contenteth men.

TECHNIS.
And such a freedome I enjoyed then,
As in those Beechie shades of Hesperie.
I planted then my soft felilicitie.
So as howsere some of our rurall Swaines
Prerogative above all others claimes,
That they have nought, want nought, nor care for ought,
Because their minde unfurnisht is of nought
That may accompish man:  I could averre,
(Howsere I doubt these in opinion erre)
That in my breast was treasured more blesse,
Then ever sensuall man could yet possesse.
For my delights were princely, and not vaine,
Where height of knowledge was my only ayme,
Whose happy purchase might enrich me more,
Then all this trash which worldly men adore.
So as if Pan were not the same he is,
He'de wish himselfe but to enjoy my blisse,
Whose choice content afford me so great power,
As I might vye with greatest Emperour.

CORYDON.
It seemes thy fate was happie;

TECHNIS.
So it was,
And did my present state so farre surpasse,
As th' high top'd Cedar cannot beare more show
Above the lowest Mushrom that doth grow,
Or more exceed in glory, than that time
Outstripp'd this present happinesse of mine.
For tell me Shepheards, what's esteem'd mongst men
The greatest joy, which I enjoy'd not then!
For is there comfort in retired life?
I did possesse a life exempt from strife,
Free from litigious clamour, or report
Sprung from commencement of a tedious Court.
Is contemplation sweete, or conference,
Or ripe conceits?  why there's an influence,
Drawne from Minerva's braine, where every wit
Transcends conceit, and seemes to ravish it.
Is it delightfull Shepheards to repose,
And all alone to reade of others woes?
Why there in Tragick Stories might we spend
Whole houres in choice discourses to a friend.
And reason of Occurrents to and fro,
And why this thing or that did happen so,
Might it content man, to allay the loade
Of a distemperd minde to walke abroad,
That he might moderate the thought of care
By choice acquaintance, or by change of ayre?
What noble consorts might you quickly finde
To share in sorrow with a troubled minde?
What cheerfull Groves, what silent murmuring springs,
Delicious walkes, and ayrie warblings,
Fresh flowrie Pastures, Gardens which might please
The senses more then did th' Hesperides,
Greene shadie Arbours, curled streames which flow,
On whose pure Margins shadie Beeches grow,
Myrtle-perfumed Plaines, on whose rer'd tops
The merry Thrush and Black-bird nimbly hops
And carols sings, so as the passers by
Would deeme the Birds infusd with poesie?

SAPPHUS.
Sure Technis this was earthly Paradise.

TECHNIS.
Sapphus it was; for what can Swaine devise
To tender all delight to eye or eare,
Taste, Smell, or Touch which was not frequent there?
Besides;

LINUS.
What could be more, pray Technis say?

TECHNIS.
We had more joyes to passe the time away.

DORYCLES.
What might they be good Technis?

TECHNIS.
'Las I know
They'r such as Shepheards cannot reach unto.

DYMNUS.
Yet let us heare them.

TECHNIS.
So I meane you shall,
And they were such as we internall call.

CORYDON.
lnfernall, Technis, what is meant by that?

TECHNIS.
Infernall, no; thou speakst thou know not what.
I meane internall gifts which farre surmount
All these externall bounties in account:
For by these blessings we shall ever finde
Rich Treasures stored in a knowing minde,
Whose glorious inside is a thousand fold
More precious than her Case though cloath'd in gold
And all Habilliments:  for by this light
Of Understanding, we discerne whats right
From crooked error, and are truly said
To understand by this, why we were made.

SAPPHUS.
Why, we nere thought of this.

LINUS.
Nay, I may sweare
I have liv'd on this Downe, this twentie yeare,
And that was my least care.

CORYDON.
Linus, I vow
To feed our Sheepe, was all that we need doe
I ever thought.

DORYCLES.
So Coridon did I.

DYMNUS.
The cause of this, good Technis, now descrie.

TECHNIS.
Heardsmen I will; with purpose to relate,
Lest my Discourse should be too intricate,
In briefe, (for length makes Memorie to faile)
The substance of your wishes in a Tale.
Within that pitchie and Cymmerian clyme,
Certaine Inhabitants dwelt on a time,
Who long had in those shadie Mountaines won,
Met never saw a glimpse of Sunne or Moon.
Yet see what custome is, though they were pent
From sight of Sunne or Moone they were content,
Sporting themselves in vaults and arched caves,
Not so like dwelling Houses, as like graves.
Nor were these men seene ere so farre to roame
At any time as halfe a mile from home;
For if they had, as th' Historie doth say,
They had beene sure right soone to lose their way:
For darke and mistie were those drerie caves
Where they repos'd, so that the wretchedst slaves
Could not exposed be to more restraint,
Than these poore snakes in th' ragged Mountaines pent;
And thus they liv'd.

LINUS.
But never lov'd.

TECHNIS.
To tell
Their loves I will not:  but it thus befell,
That a great Prince, who to encrease his fame
Had conquer'd many Countries, thither came.

SAPPHUS.
For what good Technis?

TECHNIS.
Only to survey it.

CORYDON.
Why sure he had some Torch-light to display it,
For th' Coast you say was darke.

TECHNIS.
And so it was;
But yet attend me how it came to passe:
By meanes he us'd, having this coast survei'd,
With all perswasive reasons he assaid,
Partly by faire meanes to induce them to it,
Sometimes by threats, when he was forc't unto it,
That they would leave that forlorne place, and give
Way to perswasion, and resolve to live
Neere some more cheerefull Border, which in time
They gave consent to, and forsooke their Clime.
But see the strength of Habit, when they came
To see the light they hid themselves for shame,
Their eyes grew dazled, and they did not know,
Where to retire or to what place to goe:
Yet was the Region pleasant, full of groves,
Where th' airy Quiristers expresse their loves
One to another, and with Melodie
Cheer'd and refresh'd Silvanus Emperie.
The warbling Goldfinch on the dangling spray,
Sent out harmonious Musicke every day;
The prettie speckled Violet on the Banke
With Pinke and Rose-bud placed in their ranke;
Where chafed Violets did so fresh appeare,
As they foretold the Spring-time now drew neare;
Whose borders were with various colours dy'd,
And Prim-rose bankes with odours beautifi'd;
Where Cornell trees were planted in great store,
Whose checkerd berries beautifi'd the shore.
Besides, such gorgeous buildings as no eye
Could take a view of fuller Majestie;
Whose curious pillers made of Porphyrite
Smooth to the touch, and specious to the sight,
Sent from their hollow Cell a crispling breath,
Arched above and vaulted underneath.
Yet could not all these choyce varieties
(Which might have given content to choicer eyes)
Satisfie these Cimmerians, for their ayme
Was to returne unto their Caves againe,
And so they did:  for when the Prince perceiv'd
How hard it was from error to be reav'd,
Where ignorance discerns not what is good,
Because it is not rightly understood;
Hee sent them home againe, where they remain'd
From comfort of Societie restrain'd.

DYMNUS.
Apply this Tale, my Technis;

TECHNIS.
Heare me then.
You may be well compar'd unto these men,
Who ignorant of knowledge, doe esteeme
More of your Flocks, how they may fruitfull seeme,
Then of that part, whereby you may be fed
From savage beasts to be distinguished.

DORYCLES.
Technis you are too bitter;

TECHNIS.
Not a whit,
Shepheards should tell a Shepheard what is fit:
Though I confesse that Heardsmen merit praise,
When they take care upon the Flockes they graze.
Yet to recount those Swaines of elder time,
How some were rapt with Sciences divine,
Others adorn'd with Art of Poesie,
Others to reason of Astrologie;
Swaines of this time might think't a very shame,
To be so bold as to retaine the name
Of jolly Heardsmen, when they want the worth
Of those brave Swaines which former times brought forth.

CORYDON.
Why, what could they?

TECHNIS.
Endorse their Names in trees,
And write such amorous Poems as might please
Their deerest loves.

DYMNUS.
Why Technis what was this,
Can we not please our loves more with a kisse?

DORYCLES.
Yes Dymnus, thou knowst that;

DYMNUS.
Perchance I doe,
For Dymnus knowes no other way to wooe.
But pray thee Technis let us say no more,
But hie thee now to where thou left before.

TECHNIS.
I'me easily entreated; draw then neere,
And as I lend a tongue, lend you an eare.
Having long lived in Minerva's Grove,
My life became an Embleme of pure love.

DYMNUS.
Of Love my Technis, pray thee say to whom!

TECHNIS.
As thou mean'st Dymnus, I did fancie none:
No; my affection soared higher farre,
Than on such toyes as now affected are:
I doated not on Beautie, nor did take
My aime at faire, but did observance make,
How humane things be shar'd by divine power,
Where fickle faith scarce constant rests one houre;
How highest states were subiect'st to decline;
How nought on Earth but subject unto Time;
How vice though clad in purple was but vice;
How vertue clad in rags was still in price;
How Common-weales in peace should make for warre;
How Honour crownes such as deserving are.

DORYCLES.
And yet we see such as deserved most,
What ere the cause be, are the oftest crost.

TECHNIS.
Ile not denie it (Swaine) and yet attend,
For all their crosse occurrents, but their end,
And thou shalt see the fawning Sycophant
Die in disgrace, and leave his Heire in want:
While th' honest and deserving Statesman gives
Life to his Lame and in his dying lives.
This I observ'd and many things beside,
Whilst I in famous Athens did abide;
But 'lasse whilst I secure from thought of care,
With choisest consorts did delight me there,
Free from the tongue of rumor or of strife,
I was to take me to another life.

LINUS.
To what good Technis?

TECHNIS.
To have Harpies clawes;
To take my fee and then neglect the cause.

SAPPHUS.
A Lawier Technis!

TECHNIS.
So my father said,
Who as he had commanded, I obey'd.
But judge now Shepheards, could I chuse to grieve,
When I must leave, what I was forc'd to leave,
Those sweet delightfull Arts, with which my youth
Was first inform'd, and now attain'd such growth,
As I did reape more happy comfort thence
In one short houre than many Twelve-months since?

CORYDON.
This was a hard command.

TECHNIS.
Yet was it fit
I should respect his love imposed it.
For ne're had Father showne unto his sonne
More tender love than he to me had done:
So as his will was still to me a law,
Which I observed more for love than awe,
For in that childe few seeds of grace appeare,
Whom love doth lesse induce than thought of feare
Having now tane my leave of all the Muses,
I made me fit as other Students uses,
To waine my minde, and to withdraw my sight
From all such studies gave me once delight:
And to inure me better to discerne
Suck rudiments as I desir'd to learne,
I went to John a Styles, and John an Okes,
And many other Law-baptised folkes,
Whereby I set the practise of the Law
At as light count as turning of a straw,
For straight I found how John a Styles did state it,
But I was over Style ere I came at it;
For having thought (so easie was the way)
That one might be a Lawyer the first day:
I after found the further that I went,
The further was I from my Element:
Yet forasmuch as I esteem'd it vaine,
To purchase law still from anothers braine,
I strove to get some law at any rate,
At least so much as might concerne my state.

LINUS.
I am more sorie for it.

TECHNIS.
Linus why?

LINUS.
Because I feare me thou wilt have an eye
More to thy private profit, than devise
How to attone such quarrels as arise.

DYMNUS.
Technis is none of those.

TECHNIS.
No, credit me,
Though I'me resolved many such there be
Who can dispence with fees on either part,
Which I have ever scorned with my heart;
For this shall be my practice, to assay
Without a fee to doe you th' good I may.

CORYDON.
Technis enough.

TECHNIS.
Having thus long applide
The streame of Law, my aged father dide,
Whose vertues to relate I shall not neede,
For you all knew him;

DORYCLES.
So we did indeed:
A Patron of all Justice, doe him right.

SAPPHUS.
Nor was there Art wherein he had no sight.

DYMNUS.
Yet was he humble.

LINUS.
And in that more blest.

CORYDON.
He lives though seeming dead;

TECHNIS.
So let him rest.
Having lost him whose life supported me,
You may imagine Shepheards, what might be
My hard succeeding fate:  downe must I goe
To know if this report were true or no.
Which I did finde too true, for he was dead,
And had enjoyn'd me Guardians in his stead
To sway my untraind youth.

DYMNUS.
And what were they?

TECHNIS.
Such men as I had reason to obey:
For their advice was ever for my good,
Of my greene yeeres so much had understood:
But I puft up with thought of my demaines,
Gave way to Folly, and did slacke my raines
Of long restraint;

DORYCLES.
'Las Technis, then I see
What in the end was like to fall on thee.

TECHNIS.
O Dorycles if thou hadst knowne my state,
Thou wouldst have pitted it!

CORYDON.
Nay rather hate
Thy youthfull riot.

TECHNIS.
Thou speakes well unto't,
For the Blacke Oxe had nere trod on my foot:
I had my former studies in despight,
And in the vainest consorts tooke delight.
Which much incens'd such as affection bare
To my esteeme:  but little did I care
For the instruction of my grave Protectors
Who never left me, but like wise directors
Consulted how to rectifie my state,
And some advised this, and others that,
For never any could more faithfull be
In sincere trust, than they were unto me.
At last, one to compose and end the strife,
Thought it the fitt'st that I should take a wife.

CORYDON.
Yea, now it workes.

LINUS.
Stay till he come unto't;

SAPPHUS.
And then I know he will goe roundly to't.

TECHNIS.
Nay jest not on me, but awhile forbeare,
And you the issue of my love shall heare.
Having at last concluded, as I said,
With joynt consent I should be married,
One 'mongst the rest did freely undertake
This private motion to my selfe to make,
Which I gave eare to:  wishing too that he
Would me informe where this my Wife should be.

DYMNUS.
As it was fit.

CORYDON.
Who was it thou shouldst ha?

TECHNIS.
Ile tell thee Boy, twas Amarillida.

CORYDON.
Lycas faire daughter!

TECHNIS.
Yes, the very same.

DORYCLES.
She was a wench indeed of worthie fame;

TECHNIS.
As ere fed Lambkins on this flowrie Downe:
Whom many sought and sude to make their owne,
But she affected so a virgin life,
As she did scorne to be Amyntas wife.

DYMNUS.
Is't possible?

TECHNIS.
Yes Dymnus I doe know
Some tokens of affection twixt them two,
Which if thou heard, right soone wouldst thou confesse,
More unfaind love no Heardsman could expresse:
But to omit the rest, I meane to show
The time and tide when I began to woo.
Upon that Day (sad day and heavy fate)
When every Bird is said to chuse her mate,
Did I repaire unto that fairest faire,
That ever lov'd, or liv'd, or breath'd on aire.
And her I wood, but she was so demure,
So modest bashfull, and so maiden pure,
As at the first, nor at the second time
She would no eare to sound of love incline.

CORYDON.
But this (I'm sure) would be no meanes to draw
Thy loves assault from Amarillida.

TECHNIS.
No Coridon, for then I should not seeme
Worthy so rare a Nymph as she had beene.
But I did finde that female foes would yeeld,
Though their relentlesse breasts at first were steeld.
Continuall drops will pierce the hardest stone.

SAPPHUS.
Did Technis finde her such a stony one?

TECHNIS.
Sappho I did:  yet though she oft had vowd
A vestall life, and had my suit withstood,
I found her of a better minde next day,
For she had throwne her vestall weed away.

LINUS.
Thrice happy Shepheard!

TECHNIS.
Linus, say not so;
If it be happinesse to end in woe,
Thou mightst enstyle me happy;

DORYCLES.
Was not she
Fully resolved now so marry thee?

TECHNIS.
Yes Dorycles:  but when she had consented,
Heare by what strange mischance I was prevented!
Upon a time a Summering there was,
Where every lively lad tooke in his Lasse
To dance his Measure, and amongst the rest
I tooke me one as frolike as the best.

DYMNUS.
What was she man?

TECHNIS.
A Matron full of zeale,
But pardon me, I must her name conceale.

LINUS.
It was Alburna I durst pawne my life.

TECHNIS.
I must confesse it was the Parsons wife,
A lusty Trolops I may say to you,
And one could foot it give the wench her due.

LINUS.
Yea marry Sir, there was a Lasse indeed
Knew how she should about a Maypole tread.

TECHNIS.
And I may say, if Linus had beene there,
He would have said, we evenly matched were:
For I may say at that day there was none
At any active game could put me downe.
And for a dance;

SAPPHUS.
As light as any fether,
For thou didst winne the Legge three yeeres together.

TECHNIS.
And many said that it great pittie was
That such a Parson had not such a Lasse:
So as indeed all did conclude and say,
That we deserv'd the Pricke and prize that day.
But having now our May-games wholly plaid
Danc'd till we wearie were, and Piper paid:
Each tooke his wench he danc'd with on the Downe,
Meaning to give her curt'sie of the Towne.

DYMNUS.
What curt'sie Technis?

TECHNIS.
As our Shepheards use,
Which they in modestie cannot refuse:
And this we did, and thus we parted then,
Men from their women, women from their men.

DORYCLES.
But didst nere after with Alburna meet?

TECHNIS.
Yes, on a time I met her in the street,
Who after kinde salutes invited me
Unto her house, which in civilitie
I could not well deny;

DYMNUS.
True Technis true.

TECHNIS.
And she receiv'd me, give the wench her due,
With such a free and gracefull entertaine,
As did exceed th' expectance of a Swaine.

DORYCLES.
She had some reason for't;

TECHNIS.
None I may sweare,
Save that she is joyed much to see me there.

DORYCLES.
Yet did;
TECHNIS.
Did eat, did drinke, and merry make,
For no delight save these did Technis take.
For I may say to you if so I had,
My lucke to Horse-flesh had not beene so bad,
As by some yeeres experience I have found;
So as of your suspicion there's no ground:
But if I had, no fate could be more hard
Than that which I sustained afterward

CORYDON.
Relate it Technis.

TECHNIS.
So my griefe I will,
Having done this without least thought of ill,
This (as report doth new additions draw)
Came to the eare of Amarillida:
Who jealous of my love (as women are)
Thought that Alburna had no little share
In my affection, which I may protest
Was nere as much as meant, much Lesse exprest.

SAPPHUS.
Alas good Shepheard.

TECHNIS.
So as from that day
I found her fancy falling still away,
For to what place soever I did come,
She fain'd excuse to leave me and the roome.

LINUS.
Yet she nere fix'd her love on any one.

TECHNIS.
Yes Linus, else what cause had I to mone?
Some few moneths after did she take a Mate,
I must confesse of infinite estate;
Yet in my minde (nor doe I speake't in spight)
He's one can give a woman small delight,
For he's a very Erwig.

LINUS.
What is he?

TECHNIS.
Petreius sonne;

LINUS.
The map of miserie.

TECHNIS.
Yet thou wouldst wonder how this dunghil worm
When he encounters me, redarts a scorne
On my contemned love:

DYMNUS.
All this doth show,
That he resolves to triumph in thy woe;
But how stands shee affected?

TECHNIS.
'Las for griefe,
Shee is so farre from yeelding me reliefe,
As shee in publique meetings ha's assaid
To glory in the trickes which shee hath plaid.

DORYCLES.
O matchlesse insolence!

TECHNIS.
Yet shall my blisse
In wanting her, be charactred in this;
"Having lost all that ere thy labour gain'd,
Be sure to keepe thy precious name unstain'd."

CORYDON.
A good resolve.

TECHNIS.
Yet must I never leave
While I doe live, but I must live to grieve:
For I perswade me, there was never Swaine
Was recompenc'd with more unjust disdaine.

DYMNUS.
Indeed thou well mightst grieve.

DORYCLES.
Yet shall't appeare,
I have more cause, if you my Tale will heare:
For nere was story mixed with more ruth,
Or grounded on more Arguments of truth.

CORYDON.
Let's have it Dorycles;

DORYCLES.
With all my heart,
And plainly too; griefe hates all words of art.
