Oh suffering Spain!  survey thine Argo's world&mdash;
See Bolivar's flag where Pizarro's flew&mdash;
See the proud ensigns of the free unfurl'd
From Niagara's flood to far Peru!&mdash;
What  man has done, again may not man do?
Flows not thy blood from them whose swords of yore
Cleft a red path Rome's own firm legions through,
And spurned to Calpe's wave the flying Moor?
Wake, land of Chivalry! &mdash; let Ebro pour
Henceforth his murmurs on the freeman's ear,
And let each grey Sierra statelier soar
To see "the Mountain-nymph" again draw near!&mdash;
Riego's spirit bids thee wake again&mdash;
Oh, speaks thy lost Leonidas in vain?
