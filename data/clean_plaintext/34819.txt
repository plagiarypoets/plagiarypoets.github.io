When I goe musing all alone,
Thinking of divers things sure knowne:
When I builde castles in the air,
Void of sorrow, and void of care,
Pleasing myself with phantasmes sweet,
Methinks the time runs verie sweet;
All my joyes to this are folly
None soe sweet as melancholy.

When I lye waking all alone
Thinking of divers things ill done,
My thoughts o'er me then tyrannize,
Fear and sorrow me surprize,
Whether I tarry still or go,
Methinks the time moves very slow;
All my joyes to this are folly,
Nought so sad as melancholy.

When to myself I act and smile,
With pleasing thoughts the time beguile,
By a brook side, or wood soe green,
Unheard, unsought for, and unseen,
A thousand pleasures do me bless
And crowne my soul with happiness;
All my joyes to this are folly,
Nought so sweet as melancholy.

When I lie, sit, or walk alone,
I sigh, I grieve, I make great moan,
In a dark grove, or irksome denn,
With discontents and furies, then
A thousand miseries at once
Mine heavy heart and soul entrance;
All my griefs to this are folly,
None so sowre as melancholy.

Methinks I hear, methinks I see
Sweet music, wondrous melody;
Towns, palaces, and cities fine,
Here now, then there, the world is mine,
Rare beauties, gallant ladies fine,
What e'er is lovely or divine:
All other joyes to this are folly,
Nought so sweet as melancholy.

Methinks I hear, methinks I see,
Ghosts, goblins, fiends, my phantasie
Presents a thousand ugly shapes,
Headless bears, black men, and apes,
Doleful outcries and fearful sight
My sad and dismal soul affright;
All my griefs to this are folly,
Nought so bad as melancholy.

Methinks I court, methinks I kiss,
Methinks I now embrace my mistress;
Ah!  blessed dayes, ah!  sweet content,
In Paradise my time is spent;
Let such thoughts still my fancie move,
So I may ever be in love:
All my joyes to this are folly,
Nought so sweet as melancholy.

When I recount love's many frights,
My sighs and tears, my waking nights,
My jealous fits, and mine hard fate,
I now repent, but 'tis too late;
No torment is so hard as love,
So bitter to my soul can prove:
All my griefs to this are folly,
None so harsh as melancholy.

Friends and companions get you gone,
'Tis my desire to be alone:
Ne'er well but when my thoughts and I
Do domineer in privacy;
No gem, no treasure like to this,
'Tis my delight, my crowne, my blisse:
All my joyes to this are folly,
Nought so sweet as melancholy.

'Tis my sole plague to be alone,
I am a beast, a monster grown,
I will nor light nor company,
I find it now my misery;
The scene is turn'd, my joyes are done,
Fear, discontent, and sorrows come;
Ah my griefs to this are folly,
None so fierce as melancholy.

I'll not change life with any king,
I ravish'd am, can the world bring
More joy than still to laugh and smile
In pleasant toyes time to beguile;
Doe not, ah!  do not trouble me,
So sweet content I feel, I see:
All my joyes to this are folly,
None so divine as melancholy.

I'll change my life with any wretch
Thou can'st from jayle or dunghill fetch;
My paine past cure, another hell,
I may not in this torment dwell;
Now, desparate I hate my life,
Lend me an halter, or a knife:
All my griefs to this are folly,
Nought so bad as melancholy.
