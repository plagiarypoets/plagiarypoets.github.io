O'er many a land and many a rolling wave,
Along the dreary bosom of the deep,
Alone I came to seek thy lonely grave,
And thus, a brother, mourn a brother's sleep:&mdash;
Vainly I come above thy tomb to weep,
Sighing to him whose slumber ceases not&mdash;
Vainly with tears that darkly roll I steep
Thy marble couch, and mourn thy hapless lot!
Yet, oh, my brother!  thou art not forgot!
And o'er thy tomb the wonted gifts I spread,
Such as of old above the sacred spot
The mourners scatterd to the cherished dead,&mdash;
And bid thee, kneeling o'er thy narrow cell,
Once and for ever, hail!  for evermore, farewell!
