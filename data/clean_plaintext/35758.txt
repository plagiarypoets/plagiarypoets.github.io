Hail!  blooming Spring, thou herald of the year;
In whose coat armour gloriously array'd
The blazon'd colours of all flowers appear;
Their buds are open'd and their tints display'd.

CLARINDA, then, no longer hesitate;
Nor waste on anxious thoughts thy beauties prime!
The SPRING of life to love we'll dedicate;
And happiness shall triumph over TIME!
