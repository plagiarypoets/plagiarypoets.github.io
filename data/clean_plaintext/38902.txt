I have found out a gift for my Erin,
A gift that will surely content her,&mdash;
Sweet pledge of a love so endearing!&mdash;
Five millions of bullets I've sent her.

She ask'd me for freedom and right,
But ill she her wants understood;&mdash;
Ball-cartridges, morning and night,
Is a dose that will do her more good.

There is hardly a day of our lives
But we read in some amiable trials,
How husbands make love to their wives,
Through the medium of powders and phials.

One thinks, with his mistress or mate
Some ratsbane is sure to agree;
(A medicine, which Ch&mdash;t&mdash;r of late,
Exhibited, Erin, to thee)&mdash;

While another, whom Hymen hath bless'd
With a wife that is not over placid,
Consigns the dear charmer to rest
With a dose of nice oxalic acid.

Thus, Erin, my love, do I show,
Thus quiet thee, mate of my bed!
And, as arsenic and hemp are too slow,
Do thy business with bullets, instead.

Should thy faith in my medicine be shaken,
Ask R&mdash;d&mdash;n, that mildest of Saints;
He'll tell thee, lead, inwardly taken,
Alone can remove thy complaints;&mdash;

That, blest as thou art in thy lot,
Nothing's wanted, to make it more pleasant,
But being hang'd, tortur'd, and shot,
Much oftener than thou art at present.

Even W&mdash;ll&mdash;T&mdash;n's self hath averr'd,
Thou are yet btt half sabred and hung;
And I lov'd him the more, when I heard
Such tenderness fall from his tongue.

So, take the five millions of pills,
Dear partner, that herewith I send;&mdash;
'Tis the cure that all quacks of thy ills,
From Cromwell to P&mdash;l, recommend.

And you, ye brave bullets that go,
How I wish that, before you set out,
The Devil of the Frieschutz could know
The good work you are going about;

For he'd charm ye, in spite of your lead,
Into such supernatural wit,
That you'd, all of you, know, as you spend,
Where a bullet of sense ought to hit.
