DORINDA AND SILVIA.

DORINDA.
Why Mourns my Sylvia, why these Flowing Eyes,
This Heaving Breast, and these Heart-piercing Sighs,
Is Corridon unkind?  Or have your Sheep
(Neglected) Stray'd, whilst you their Roving weep?

SILVIA.
Ah!  no &mdash; Had I the Grisly Wolf beheld,
Devour them Quick (and yet they ne'er rebell'd,
But always at my Call, Obedient came,
Each Bounding with Delights, to hear his Name)
Such Floods of Tears, their Loss wou'd ne'er deplore,
Nor Corridon, altho' He were no more.
But such a Mournful Sight I've seen, alas!
So sad, so wondrous sad, 'twill far surpass,
All that my Falt'ring Tongue knows to relate,
The most Terrific Blow of Unauspicious Fate.
Oh!  Had I sunk into Eternal Rest,
Before the Vision had disturb'd my Breast!

DORINDA.
Altho' thy words Portentous seem, mine Ear
Expands to take them, whilst it dreads to hear;
Dear Silvia, let thy Voice the whole confess,
I'll bear my Part, to make thy Load the less.

SILVIA.
First let me ease a while my o'ercharg'd Eyes,
For ev'ry Accent will advance Supplies.
&mdash;In Yonder Dark and Melancholly Shade,
Of Baleful Yew and Fatal Cypress Made,
URANIA sits &mdash; dissolv'd alas!  in Tears,
And by Her lies&mdash;

DORINDA.
My Prophetick Fears.

SILVIA.
Departed CELADON.  Her faithful Sheep
Stand gazing round, and Mournful Silence keep:
The Drooping Choiristers with Flagging Wing,
His Obsequies in Dying Accents sing:
The Murm'ring Brook, the Osiers slowly Laves,
Moves heav'ly on, and Checks the flowing Waves:
A Gen'ral Hush goes round, shock'd at the Blow,
URANIA'S tender Heart, must undergo.

DORINDA.
Oh!  Cease a while, such big-swoln Griefs arise,
Oh!  Cease, 'till they find Passage through mine Eyes.
&mdash;The Thrilling Sorrows of URANIA'S Heart,
Who can Imagine and not feel a Part.
She whose Unrivall'd Charms, the World engage,
The Choice of Heav'n, and Darling of the Age;
As Good, as Great, as Merciful as Wise,
Joy of all Hearts, Delight of all our Eyes;
So Soft her Temper, so Compassionate,
It Stifles Envy, as it Cancels Hate.
When She must Suffer, and such Sorrows Feel,
What Heart of Adamant, what Breast of Steel,
What Cruel Tyrant, Barb'rously Inclin'd,
But must, Relenting, grow both Soft and Kind,
And such a Loss as CELADON, bemoan,
Whilst Universal Nature gives a Groan:
&mdash;For Oh, their Tender Loves,

SILVIA.
Prophan'd, when they're compar'd to Turtle Doves.
Not such Soft Tenderness the Mother knows,
To see the Product of her Cruel Throws;
Not such the Blushing Virgin, when her Heart,
Takes first Impression from th' unerring Dart;
Nor such the Lover when his Nymph complies,
And He with the Extatick Pleasure dies.
But Faint Essays these, to our Royal Pair,
Whose Gen'rous Souls, far more Capacious were,
And more Extensive Passions form'd to bear,
Bare Union cou'd not their Bright Loves express,
More like to Angel's Flames, when they Caress,
And Mingling Forms, Seraphick Jove confess.

DORINDA.
What One Injoy'd, the Other did partake,
The Joy Exalted for the Other's sake.
Crowns, Thrones and Triumphs, which amuse the Great,
Ballanc'd with Love, were Overpoiz'd in Weight;
A Spacious Throne Each to the Other was,
Which all the Throne on Earth did far surpass,
When Home, or Forreign Exigencies Prest,
Or Cares of State fatigu'd Urania's Breast.
Their Trouble and Concernment strait were gone,
And  vanish'd in the Smiles of CELADON.

SILVIA.
When Her Victorious Arms from Hostile Fields,
Brought all the Joys, Triumphant Conquest Yields,
Unmov'd She seem'd, till CELADON She found,
And His Lov'd Temples, with the Lawrels Crown'd.
Whilst He releas'd from all Morbific Pains,
A Perfect Health enjoy'd through all his Veins;
For Her Bright, Salutifrous Presence brought,
More Ease than Aesculapius-skill e'er wrought.

DORINDA.
In Mutual Joys their Hours thus slid away,
Their Mutual Joys increasing ev'ry Day,
Thus did They in continu'd Raptures Live,
And all the Bliss, which Heav'n on Earth cou'd give.

SILVIA.
But now alas!  They've ceas'd, forever done,
For CELADON, oh Dreadful Sound!  Is gone,
Gone to Eternal Rest, new Thrones to gain,
And Never, Never, must return again.

DORINDA.
In vain URANIA'S Tears, in vain Her Cries,
In vain Her Mournful Plaints and Scalding Sighs,
In vain Her Soft Desires, and all Her Charms,
They ne'er again must Bring Him to Her Longing Arms.

SILVIA.
Silent She sits beneath the Horrid Gloom,
Nor Thinks nor Hopes for any Joys to come,
Whilst vast tumultuous Griefs croud on Her Breast,
Fixt like the Center, yet She finds no Rest.
Now She revolves on all the Bliss is past,
Then sighs to think, that She has seen the Last:
That now their Mutual Flames no more must burn,
Nor Chearful Hours of Converse e'er again return;
Opprest then with the Load, She sinks to Earth,
And then Revives to give her Woes New Birth;
Which by fresh Acquisitions, Greater Grow,
Till all Tenacious Bounds the Torrents Overflow.

No Mortal can express a Grief like Thine,
No Mortal, who is not like Thee, Divine,
Inform'd with such a vast Capacious Soul,
In which so large a Floud of Grief may Roul,
And yet too Great e'n for thy self they Grow,
And all Tenacious Bounds, and Torrents Overflow.

But see Dorinda, Night with solemn Pace,
Moves slowly on, and Phaebe's sickly Face,
Bound up in Clouds, Ascends Yon Eastern Skies,
Whilst Chearful Day Her Mournful Visage flies.
The Priests of Pan, their Ev'ning Offrings bring,
And to th' Indulgent God their Vespers sing,
For his Protection of their Sheep all Day,
But Ours, neglected, all are gone astray.

DORINDA.
For ever let them wander, since no Rest,
Must e'er re-enter my forsaken Breast;
O'ercharg'd with Sorrows for URANIA'S sake:

SILVIA.
So much my sad and troubled Thoughts partake
They sit upon my Soul (Griev'd at the Sight)
Like heavy Plumets of Eternal Night.

DORINDA.
Let's part no Dearest Silvia, for our Woe
Begins, alas!  Ineffable to grow;
And yet my Boding Soul (to add new Pain)
Whispers, alas!  we ne'er shall meet again.

SILVIA.
Something so Ominious in mine appears,
As says 'twill soon be wafted hence in Tears.
A long Farewell, Eternall, Adieu.

DORINDA.
A long Farewell, to Love and Life, and You.
