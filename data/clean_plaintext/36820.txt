I to thee hie, because my soul is sick,&mdash;
Sick with mankind and their disgusting ways;
Although but lately kindled my life's wick,
And but now gathering into manhood's blaze,
Much hath it felt the world's foul murky haze;
Ay, &mdash; I have lived quite long enough to tell,
That Love, Truth, Virtue, in the world's wild maze
Perish, &mdash; they cannot hide the boisterous swell&mdash;
Corruption's mighty surge &mdash; that roars their funeral knell.
