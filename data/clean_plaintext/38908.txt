Though I am wedded to far other lore,
And far severer, than the muse requires:
Friend! &mdash; I rejoice in Feeling's every pore,
At the pure fame of thy devout desires.
Some Bards have kindled their too brilliant fires,
At the gross altar, and unhallowed hearth;
Thou hast been joined to more exalted choirs,
And, uninspired to sing our second birth,
Hath poured the ointment of thy praise upon the joys of earth.
