Young world of peace and loveliness farewell!
Farewell to the clear lake, the mountains blue;
The grove, whose tufted paths our eyes pursue
Delighted; the white cottage in the dell
By yon old church; the smoke from that small cell
Amid the hills slow rising; and the hue
Of summer air, fresh, delicate, and true,
Breathing of light and life &mdash; the master spell!
Work of the Poet's eye, the Painter's hand,
How close to nature art thou, yet how free
From earthly stain!  the beautiful, the bland,
The rose, the nightingale, resemble thee:&mdash;
Thou art most like the blissful Fairy-land
Of Spenser, or Mozart's fine melody.
