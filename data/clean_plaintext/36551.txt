JOHN ROBERTSON'S remains in sweet repose,
Beneath the Savior's all benignant eye,
Here wait this bustling world's eventful close,
And time's last groan that calls them to the sky.
Here breathe, O saint!  the sympathetic sigh,
And friendship shed thy spirit soothing tear,
For soft as breath of violet stealing by,
Beneficent as dewy April clear,
Was he, the spirit meek, whose clay reposes here.
