He's gone!  the gallant and the gifted youth,
And plies his glorious search no more below.
His search was knowledge, well-earned fame, and truth:
For these he crossed the trackless wastes of snow;
For these he held communion with the deep,
And traced the silent heavens, while all around was sleep.

He watch'd the gleaming points of dubious light,
Which cheat the gazer with a treacherous dawn;
He mark'd the stars that wheel their circles bright,
Through midnight skies, but vanish in the morn.
Like these he faded from his opening day,
Like those his brightness gleam'd, and darkness quench'd the ray.

When waters raged and down the billowy fall
Death chased the bark, and sprang to seize his prey,
He dared to pass, and utter'd first the call,
To save the sinking comrades.  On that day
A Hero's fame he earn'd, and many a voice
For Husband, Father saved, doth in that fame rejoice.

But on the verge of a more dread abyss,
He stood in greater calmness; knew the stream
Of life was bearing him to gulfs than this
More deep, more overwhelming.  We may deem
A Christian Hero him, who view'd life's close
With steady eye, and faith, the spirit's calm repose.

"He trusted still."  And was his trust in vain?
O no!  it cheer'd him to his latest hour,
And will beyond the grave.  It soothes the pain
Of those who mourn to see his face no more.
It tells, "Let heroes share their hard-earn'd fame,
But reverence and love endear the Christian's name."
