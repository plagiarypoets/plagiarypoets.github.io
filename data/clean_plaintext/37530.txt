Stern scourge of Lux'ry, and imperious Pride,
Child of Intemperance blasting human bliss!
How chills the vigorous mind
By thy fell pow'r controll'd!

Thee, writhing pain, thee, wasting sickness wait,
Thee, all the agonizing train of death;&mdash;
Thrown on thy freezing bed
Thou feel'st keen-biting gales:

Loud ruffian tempests shake thy tottering shed
Whilst thou, unshelter'd in the savage night,
Reprov'st the tardy hours
That linger thro' the gloom.

Yet not the dewy Day-light sooths thy soul,
Nor Eve, who draws her weeping shadows round,
Nor sweet, indulgent Spring,
With all her fragrant store;

Her whispering airs, and scenes of vernal joy,
Her sunny vale, green hill, and babbling brook.
Thee, nor brown Summer woos,
Fond stripling of desire,

Who, breathless, pants across the sultry wilds,
Or, seeks the crystal depth, or rustling shade,
Where, thro' his glowing sense
A cool refreshment breathes.

Unblest by thee, dejected Autumn dies;
When fading Nature warns us of decay,
And, leafless forests howl,
Hoarse winds, and storms pursue

The boisterous track of Winter!  Driving hail
From dun bleak skies, quick-pattering on the cliffs
Descends; while hamlets groan
Beneath collected snows.

Then, torrents wild, with deafening clamours, roar,
And fearful nights succeed tempestuous days,
And Fancy blacker paints
Thy frantic, dark despair.

By thee deprest, poor unprotected Worth
Shrinks into blind obscurity's damp cell;
There, lingering, and forgot,
He meets a silent grave.

Deprest by thee, how groans the shipwreck'd wretch,
Cast on loose-hanging, frightful rocks, forlorn,
While round him dreadful breaks
The foamy billow's rage!

Ah!  grim-brow'd tyrant, mitigate thy wrath,
Forbear to blast me with thy withering gaze;
With deadly-pressing hand
Forbear to chill my heart!
