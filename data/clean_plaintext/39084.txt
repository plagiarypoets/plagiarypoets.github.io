While songsters their rivers to praise do combine,
Their Arno's, their Banna's, their Tweed's, and their Dee's;
To the Nymphs of Honduras the task shall be mine,
To sing the more beautiful Banks of Balize.

See the nymphs and the swains in their Dories are singing,
While echo the music resounds through the trees;
Observe how the fishes around them are springing,
Their joy to express in the River Balize.

Here young alligators are playfully sporting,
Here tigers so nimble, and droves of warrees;
All frisking like lambkins, and wantonly courting,
Along the sweet banks of the River Balize.

No proud marble domes upon these rural plains,
Nor mansions of grandeur the traveller sees;
But marks what a charming simplicity reigns
In the wood-cutter's hut on the Banks of Balize.

Let those who delight in fine fish and fresh air,
Enjoy their own pleasures on Honduras' Quays;
More happy am I in attending the fair
On the banks of the smooth flowing River Balize.

Ye Aldermen who on rich turtle would feast,
Or would wish to indulge on our fam'd Mannatees,
Leave the city awhile, then come hither, and taste
This delicate food on the Banks of Balize.

The songs of Moskitoes shall lull you to sleep;
Songs sweet as the whisp'ring of winds thro' the trees;
While Doctors and Sand-flies their vigils do keep,
To suck your rich blood on the Banks of Balize.
