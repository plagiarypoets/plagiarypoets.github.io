Thus sacred Virgil liv'd, from courtly Vice
And Baits of pompous Rome secure, at Court
Still thoughtful of the rural honest Life,
And how t' improve his Grounds, and how himself:
Best Poet!  fit Exemplar for the Tribe
Of Phoebus, nor less fit Maeonides,
Poor eyeless Pilgrim!  and if after these,
If after these another I may name,
Thus tender Spencer liv'd, with mean Repast
Content, depres'd by Penury, and Pine
In foreign Realm:  Yet not debas'd his Verse
By Fortune's Frowns.  And had that Other Bard,
Oh, had but He that first enobled Song
With holy Raptures, like his Abdiel been,
'Mong many faithless, strictly faithful found;
Unpity'd he should not have wail'd his Orbs,
That roll'd in vain, to find the piercing Ray,
And found no Dawn, by dim Suffusion veil'd!
But He &mdash; However, let the Muse abstain,
Nor blast his Fame from whom she learnt to sing
In much inferior Strains, grov'ling beneath
Th' Olympian Hill, on Plains and Vales intent,
Mean Follower.  There let her rest a-while,
Pleas'd with the fragrant Walks and cool Retreat.
