Lur'd by the taper's fascinating light,
The heedless insect wooes its smiling ray,
And round the beauteous blaze,
In giddy circles flies.

Far from the dazzling snare, his timid course
At first he feels; till with embolden'd wing
He near and nearer draws,
Strikes on the flame, and falls.

But warn'd in vain, still of the treach'rous light
Enamour'd, he repeats his blind career,
Then rushes on his fate,
And in the blaze expires.

So fares it with the youth, whose hapless feet
Have been seduc'd by Pleasure's meteor ray
From HER whose paths alone
Are pleasantness and peace.

From VIRTUE'S paths, to those enchanted bowers,
Where Folly with luxuriant roses crown'd
To tempt the unwary lip,
Her pois'nous bowl prepares:

While Vice, fell Syren, with her warbled strain
Allures him onward, through her myrtle shades,
And odours round him flow,
Soft streams, and luscious gales.

Then on a precipice, whose verge with flow'rs,
Is all concealed, she charms her prey asleep;
Into the abyss below
He falls, to rise no more.

Fly then, Philander, the voluptuous scenes
Where tempting ruin smiles in Beauty's form:
Nor let her o'er thee wave
Her soul-transforming wand:

Or if thou stay, dash from her hand at once
The nectar'd cup, whose sweets imbrue the mind,
And (as her victims feel)
Are bitterness and woe.

Yes, nobly vanquish the Circean spells
With which she binds the weak.  Th' heroick heart
Her blandishments disdains,
Her strategems defies.

So shall thy morn with gradual course decline,
Unclouded, and th' enlivening ray of health
With roseate lustre gild
The evening of thy days.

So shall the faithful monitor within,
With still small voice, e'en whisper peace and hope,
When outward comforts fail,
To thy departing soul.

Possess, thou faithful servant, will it say,
Thy Lord's own JOY; for of thy stedfast zeal
The record is on high,
The witness is in Heaven.
