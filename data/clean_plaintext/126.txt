Yet let Affection interpret selfe:
Arcadia brave, and dowty Faery Queene
Cannot be stain'd by Gibeline, or Guelph,
Or goodliest Legend, that Witts eye hath seene.
The dainty Hand of exquisitest Art,
And nimble Head of pregnantest receit,
Never more finely plaid their curious part,
Then in those lively Christals of conceit.
Other fair Wittes I cordially embrace:
And that sweete Muse of azur Dy, admire:
And must in every Sonnet interlace
The earthly Soveraine of heavenly fire.
A fitter place remaineth to implore,
Of deepest Artists the profoundest lore.
