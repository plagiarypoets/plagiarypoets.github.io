A Traveller on the skirt of Sarum's Plain
O'ertook an aged Man with feet half bare;
Propp'd on a trembling staff he crept with pain,
His legs from slow disease distended were;
His temples just betrayed their silver hair
Beneath a kerchief's edge, that wrapp'd his head
To fence from off his face the breathing air.
Stuck miserably o'er with patch and shred
His ragged coat scarce showed the Soldier's faded red.

"And dost thou hope across the Plain to trail
That frame o'ercome with years and malady,
Those feet that scarcely can outcrawl the snail,
These withered arms of thine, that faltering knee?
Come, I am strong and stout, come lean on me."
The old man's eyes a wintry lustre dart,
And so sustained he faced the open lea.
But short the joy that touched his melting heart,
For ere a mile be gone his friend and he must part.

Nor of long absence failed he soon to tell
And how he with the Soldier's life had striven
And Soldier's wrongs; but one who knew him well
A house to his old age had lately given.
Thence he had limp'd to meet a daughter driven
By circumstance which did all faith exceed
From every stay but him:  his heart was riven
At the bare thought:  the creature that had need
Of any aid from him most wretched was indeed.
