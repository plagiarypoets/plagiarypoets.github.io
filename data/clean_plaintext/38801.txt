Dear Chloe, what means this Disdain,
Which blasts each Endeavour to please?
Though Forty, I am free from all Pain;
Save Love, I am free from Disease.
No Graces my Mansion have fled,
No Muses have broken my Lyre;
The Loves frolic still round my Bed,
And Laughter is chear'd at my Fire.

To none have I ever been cold,
All Beauties in Vogue I'm among;
I've Appetite e'en for the Old,
And Spirit enough for the Young.
Believe me, sweet Girl, I speak true,
Or else put my Love to the Test;
Some others have doubted like you,
Like them do you bless and be blest.
