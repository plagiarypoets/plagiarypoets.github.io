Down in a northern vale wild flow'rets grew,
And lent new sweetness to the summer gale;
The Muse there found them all remote from view,
Obscur'd with weeds, and scattee'd o'er the dale.
O Lady, may so slight a gift prevail,
And at your gracious hand acceptance find?
Say, may an ancient legendary tale
Amuse, delight, or move the polish'd mind?
Surely the cares and woes of human kind,
Tho' simply told, will gain each gentle ear:
But all for you the Muse her lay design'd,
And bade your noble Ancestors appear;
She seeks no other praise, if you commend,
Her great protectress, patroness, and friend.
