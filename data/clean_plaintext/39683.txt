Hark, my fair one, the summons of love,
Cries, Away, my dear vot'ries, away:
Lovely Polly, beware how you prove
The mischances attending delay.

See the vernal spring bloom all around,
And the gay fields in verdure array'd;
See the blythe Nymphs advance o'er the ground,
By their Shepherds so willingly fed.

Then away with your ill-grounded fears,
Your romantic and idle alarms;
See the priest at the altar appears,
To secure you to Corydon's arms!

Oh!  be wise, my dear charmer, in time,
Whilst the Graces your person adorn;
For, when once you have pass'd life's sweet prime,
You may long live a maiden forlorn!

Let us haste the sweet bliss to secure,
We can each to the other impart;
And, in joys which shall ever endure,
Drive affliction away from our heart.
