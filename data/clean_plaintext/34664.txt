I.
Ye Dryads of my grove who tend
With plastic hand each drooping spray,
And o'er yon trunks with wanton bend
Teach the wild woodbine's arms to stray,
In pleasing meditation laid
Where the thick pine's embowering shade
Hangs nodding o'er the lazy stream,
If you my artless songs inspire,
Joyful I catch the chorded lyre
Impatient for the promis'd theme;

II.
And lo!  portray'd in vivid dyes
By Fancy's imitative hand
The visionary forms arise,
And glitter thro' her fairy land:
I from the blended lanschape chuse
That labyrinth, where in milder hues
Glows simple Nature's various green;
Can laurell'd Glory's ample field,
Can Wisdom's hermitages yield
A less exceptionable scene?

III.
The slender pink, whose velvet bloom
In tints so delicately pale
Scatters around a rich perfume,
And gladdens all the neighb'ring vale,
Is gather'd by some smiling Maid,
Her loosely flowing hair to braid;
On the bleak mountain's lonely side
While the rude yew's unsightly stem
In vain expands it's noxious gem,
And boasts it's disregarded pride.

IV.
While thus, ye Nymphs, beneath your shade
I tune this inoffensive  lay,
Perhaps directed by your aid
Thro' Learning's unambitious way
Shall I persue my purpos'd road
To where in Virtue's calm abode
Unruffled by the stormy tides,
That bursting on the rocks of strife
Assault the foundering bark of life,
The philosophic Muse presides.

V.
Impregnating life's mingled bowl
With sweetest drugs, serenely gay
Ye steal upon the troubled soul.&mdash;
In elder times your gentle sway
Extended o'er the happy plains
Of Arcady; then pastoral strains
Echoed from every Shepherd's cot,
While o'er the smiling fields He saw
Astraea's self dispensing law,
And bless'd his favorable lot:

VI.
With nobler fire the Poet glow'd,
No interest urg'd his slavish theme,
But, as his careless numbers flow'd,
Enjoy'd the dear enchanting dream;
Oft stretch'd upon the fabled mount,
Whence Acidalia's tuneful fount
Devolves its waves, intranc'd He lay,
There haply view'd the Cyprian Queen,
Unknown admir'd her easy mein,
And mark'd her negligent array;

VII.
And oft (when thron'd in full-orb'd light
Pale Cynthia's gliding chariot seen
Dispell'd the vaulted gloom of night
And glitter'd thro' the blue serene)
While thro' the still and pensive glade
In thoughtful attitude he stray'd
Heedless of midnight's hovering dews,
Beheld your sprightly train advance,
And, as Ye join'd the choral dance,
Recite your lessons of the Muse.

VIII.
Then unsupported Reason's aid
In Athens' venerable grove
To learning's Votaries display'd
The shrine of universal love,
From where the Swan's ambitious flight
Soaring a more than usual height
Was seen to cleave the liquid sky,
Emblem of Plato's lofty soul
Expatiating beyond controul
In virtue's purer galaxy.

IX.
But where is Tempe's valley now,
And where that pleasurable scene
Which on aspiring Pindus brow
Once flourish'd in eternal green?
When hostile inroads and th' alarms
Of Macedon's victorious arms
Prevail'd; in that ill-fated hour
Each mead resign'd its blasted pride,
Each laurel shrunk its leaves, and died,
And every Nymph forsook her bower.

X.
In better days tho' oft the throng
Of Satyrs stung with mad desire
By shameful dance, or impious song
Invaded your astonish'd choir:
Tho' oft, alas!  the ruthless hand
Of War with desolating brand
Has scath'd the foliage of your oaks,
Tho' oft their hoary honours spread
O'er the tall mountain's shelter'd head
Have sunk beneath the Woodman's strokes:

XI.
Tho' in your holy Grotts retir'd
The subtle Priests with venom'd breath
The thirst of homicide inspir'd,
And wak'd the slumbering coals of death:
To their polluted altars led
Where erst the captive Youth had bled
Victim of hellish cruelty,
Devoted Mona's frantic shade
In vain implor'd your guardian aid
O'erthrown by Roman victory:

XII.
Yet never gave your presence birth
To murders fell, to battles rude,
To taunting jests, or boisterous mirth
Which on your favorite seats intrude;
Ye haunt not that licentious grove
Where Spenser's desperate Champions rove,
Your chaste ear loves not to be told
Of blatant beasts, of dread Despair
With glaring eyes, with clotted hair,
And brutal chivalries of old.

XIII.
In Avignon's delightful shades,
Where Petrarch fix'd his lowly cell,
Perhaps Ye silver-footed Maids,
By cool Valclusa's ebbing well
Ye deign to tend the rising flowers
And bid the myrtle's shadowy bowers
A more enchanting fragrance shed;
And there the earliest rose is found,
Where on the rude uncultur'd ground
Your Bard reclin'd his sinking head;

XIV.
For there engrav'd upon the rind
Of every plane, and spreading beach
The fond complaints of love Ye find,
Which move beyond the power of speech,
And where He shed the tender tear
O'er his departed Laura's bier,
To sooth her hovering shade Ye bring
The freshest lilies of the vale,
And waft the soft refreshing gale
On welcome Zephyrs balmy wing.

XV.
But, O wherever Ye reside,
If e'er the Muse's piercing eye
Could search the mystic scrolls, which hide
The annals of futurity;
When Death shall break the scythe of Time
Triumphant to some happier clime
The Shades of innocence aspire,
Where oft amidst his kindred groves
The Bard's exulting Spirit roves,
And joys to meet your social choir.

XVI.
Yes:  They who erst content to rove
Thro' Poesy's sequester'd sphere,
Or wak'd the Cyprian lute of love,
Or bade mild Pity's starting tear
Bedew the couch of Misery, find
With strict morality combin'd
Sweet pleasure's mediating wiles;
There seeking oft the Tuscan bowers
Where Horace pass'd his jocund Hours
E'en philosophic rigor smiles.
