Whenne him who for his Doughtir dyed,
Quelling a leude base losell's pryde,
This londe grown slombrous schall foryitt
Maydennes schall heare with dradde of PITT.

Whenne this rude mace which me hath smote
Calls ydlers on a Show to glote
SIXTEENE a-new dismaye shall frit
And shee schall shrinke at syght of PITT.

Whenne Englond woxen osere schall bee
Yil starr'd by londe bot haut by see
A fearful loade her polle schall splitt
While Sixteene quakes at name of PYTTE.

Of him it needes hir littel fears
But lightly doth he heed hir yeeres
Send not Polle-clippers where unfitte
Sixteene thee prieth, Maister PYTTE.

Ne King mare staide, ne sadderre Queene
Ne Maydes mare faire, ne Clerks mare teen
Ne words mare glibbe were sedde or writt
Thanne whenne Sixteene schall stert at PYTTE.

The daies of knyghtnoode auide bin gon
Yet Sixteene hath hir Chaumpyonn
And yll at reste mies Goste schall flitt
In Sixteene rue of Maister PYTTE.

Ah ne'er mote gatherers rude and base
With shame caste donne the Mayden's face,
To proven giffe meet for Polle as yett
Warne thee Polle-pillours Maistre PYTTE.
