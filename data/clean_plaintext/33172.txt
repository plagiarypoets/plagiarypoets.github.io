THE ARGUMENT.
Roget Here on Willy calls,
To sing out his Pastorals:
Warrants Fame shall grace his Rimes,
Spight of Envy and the Times;
And shewes how in care he uses
To take comfort from his Muses.

ROGET.  WILLY.

ROGET.
Prethee, Willy, tell me this,
What new accident there is,
That thou (once the blythest Lad)
Art become so wondrous sad?
And so carelesse of thy quill,
As if thou hadst lost thy skill?
Thou wert wont to charme thy Flockes,
And among these rudest rockes
Hast so cheer'd me with thy Song,
That I have forgot my wrong.
Something hath thee surely crost,
That thy old wont thou hast lost.
Tell me, Have I ought mis-said
That hath made thee ill a-paid
Hath some Churle done thee a spite?
Dost thou misse a Lambe to night?
Frownes thy fairest Shepheards Lasse?
Or how comes this ill to passe?
Is there any discontent
Worse than this my banishment?

WILLY.
Why doth that so evil seeme
That thou nothing worse dost deeme?
Shepheard. there full many bee,
That will chang Contens with thee.
Those that choose their Walkes at will,
On the Valley or the Hill.
Or those Pleasures boast of can,
Groves or Fieldes may yeeld to man:
Never come to know the rest,
Wherewithall thy minde is blest.
Many a one that oft resorts
To make up the troope at sports,
And in company some while,
Happens to straine foorth a smile:
Feeles more want, more outward smart,
And more inward griefe of hart,
Then this place can bring to thee,
While thy minde remayneth free.
Thou condemn'st my want of mirth,
But what find'st thou in this earth,
Wherein ought may be beleev'd
Worth to make me joy'd, or grieved?
And yet feele I (nathelesse)
Part of both I must confeses,
Sometime I of mirth doe borrow,
Otherwhile as much of sorrow,
But my present state is such,
I am not Joy'd, nor grieve I much.

ROGET.
Why hath WILLY then so long
Thus forborne his wonted Song?
Wherefore doth he now let fall
His well-tuned Pastorall,
And my ears that musicke barre,
Which I more long after farre,
Than the libertie I want,

WILLY.
That were very much to grant,
But doth this hold alway lad,
Those that sing not must be sad?
Did'st thou ever that Bird heare
Sing well, that sings all the yeare?
Tom the Piper doth not play
Till he weares his Pipe away:
There's a time to slacke the string,
And a time to leave to sing.

ROGET.
Yea, but no man now is still,
That can sing, or tune a quill.
Now to chant it, were but reason,
Song and Musicke are in season,
Now in this sweet jolly tide,
Is the earth in all her pride.
The faire Lady of the May
Trim'd up in her best array
Hath invited all the Swaines,
With the Lasses of the Plaines
To attend upon her sport
At the places of resort.
Corridon (with his bould Rout)
Hath already been about
For the elder Shepheards dole,
And fetch'd in the Summer-Pole:
Whilest the rest have built a Bower,
To defend them from a shower,
Siel'd so close with boughs all greene,
Tytan cannot pry betweene.
Now the Dayrie-Wenches dreame
Of their Strawberries and Creame:
And each doth her selfe advance
To be taken in to dance:
Every one that knowes to sing,
Fits him for his Carolling;
So doe those that hope for meede,
Either by the Pipe or Reede:
And though I am kept away,
I doe hear (this very day)
Many learned Groomes doe wend.
For the Garlands to contend.
Which a Nimph that hight Desart,
(Long a stranger in this part)
With her owne faire hand hath wrought
A rare worke (they say) past thought,
As appeareth by the name,
For she calles them Wreathes of fame.
She hath set in their due place
Ev'ry flower that may grace,
And among a thousand moe,
(Whereof some but serve for show)
She hath wove in Daphnes tree,
That they may not blasted bee.
Which with Time she edg'd about,
Least the worke should ravell out.
And that it might wither never,
Intermixt it with Live-ever.
These are to be shar'd among,
Those that do excell for song:
Or their passions can rehearse,
In the smooth'st and sweetest verse.
Then for those among the rest,
That can play and pipe the best,
There's a Kidling with the Damme,
A fat Weather, and a Lambe.
And for those that leapen farre,
Wrastle, Runne, and throw the Barre,
There's appoynted guerdons to:
He that best the first can doe,
Shall for his reward be payd
With a Sheepe-hooke, faire in-layd
With fine Bone, of a strange Beast
That men bring from out the West.
For the next, a Scrip of red,
Tassell'd with fine coloured Thred:
There's prepared for their need,
That in running make most speed,
Or the cunning Measures foote,
Cups of turned Maple-roote,
Whereupon the skilfull man
Hath ingrav'd the Loves of Pan:
And the last hath for his due,
A fine Napkin wrought with blew.
Then my Willy why art thou
Carelesse of thy merit now?
What dost thou here with a wight
That is shut up from delight,
In a solitary den,
As not fit to live with men?
Goe my Willy get thee gone,
Leave me in exile alone.
Hye thee to that merry throng,
And amaze them with thy Song,
Thou art young, yet such a Lay
Never grac'd the month of May,
As (if they provoke thy skill)
Thou canst fit unto thy Quill,
I with wonder heard thee sing,
At our last yeers Revelling.
Then I with the rest was free,
When unknowne I noted thee:
And perceiv'd the ruder Swaines,
Envy thy farre sweeter straines.
Yea, I saw the Lasses cling
Round about thee in a Ring:
As if each one jealous were
Any but her selfe should heare.
And I know they yet doe long
For the res'due of thy Song.
Haste thee then to sing it foorth,
Take the benefite of woorth.
And Desert will sure bequeath
Fames faire Garland for thy wreath.
Hye thee Willy, hye away.

WILLY.
Roget, rather let me stay,
And be desolate with thee,
Than at those their Revels bee,
Nought such is my skill I wis,
As indeed thou deem'st it is.
But what ere it be, I must
Be content, and shall I trust.
For a Song I doe not passe
Mong'st my friends, but what (alas)
Should I have to doe with them
That my Musicke doe contemne?
Some there are, as well I wot,
That the same yet favour not:
Yet I cannot well avow
They my Carrols disallow:
But such malice I have spied,
Tis as much as if they did.

ROGET.
Willy, what may those men bee,
Are so ill, to malice thee?

WILLY.
Some are worthy-well esteem'd,
Some without worth are so deem'd.
Others of so base a spirit,
They have nor esteeme, nor merit.

ROGET.
What's the wrong?

WILLY.
A slight offence,
Wherewithall I can dispense;
But hereafter for their sake
To my selfe I'le musicke make.

ROGET.
What, because some Clowne offends,
Wilt thou punish all thy friends?

WILLY.
Honest Roget understand me,
Those that love me may command me.
But, thou know'st, I am but young,
And the Pastorall I sung,
Is by some suppos'd to be
(By a straine) too high for me:
So they kindely let me gaine
Not my labour for my paine.
Trust me, I doe wonder why
They should me my owne deny.
Though I'me yong, I scorne to flit
On the wings of borrowed wit.
I'le make my owne feathers reare me,
Whither others cannot beare mee.
Yet I'le keepe my skill in store,
Till I've seene some Winters more.

ROGET.
But in earnest mean'st thou so?
Then thou art not wise, I trow.
Better shall advise thee Pan,
For thou dost not rightly than:
Thats the ready way to blot
All the credit thou hast got.
Rather in thy Ages prime,
Get another start of Time:
And make those that so fond bee,
(Spite of their own dulnesse) see
That the sacred Muses can
Make a child in yeares, a man.
It is knowne what thou canst doo,
For it is not long agoe,
When that Cuddy, Thou, and I,
Each the others skill to try,
At Saint Dunstanes charmed well,
(As some present there can tell)
Sang upon a sodaine Theame,
Sitting by the Crimson streame:
Where, if thou didst well or no,
Yet remaines the Song to show.
Much experience more I've had,
Of thy skill (thou happy Lad)
And would make the World to know it;
But that Time will further show it:
Envy makes their tongues now runne
More than doubt of what is done;
For that needs must be thy owne,
Or to be some other's knowne:
But how then wilt suit unto
What thou shalt hereafter do?
Or I wonder where is hee,
Would with that song part to thee:
Nay, were there so mad a Swaine,
Could such glory sell for gaine;
Phoebus would not have combin'd
That gift with so base a minde.
Never did the Nine impart
The sweet secrets of their art
Unto any that did scorne,
We should see their favours worne
Therefore unto those that say,
Where they pleased to sing a Lay,
They could doo't, and will not tho;
This I speake, for this I know:
None ere drunke the Thespian spring,
And knew how, but he did sing.
For that once infus'd in man
Makes him shew't, doe what he can.
Nay those that do only sip
Or but ev'n their fingers dip
In that sacred Fount, poore Elves,
Of that brood will show themselves.
Yea, in hope to get them fame,
They will speake though to their shame
Let those then at thee repine
That by their witts measure thine.
Needs those Songs must be thine owne,
And that one day will be knowne.
That same imputation to,
I my selfe doe undergoe:
But it will appeare ere long,
I'me abus'd, and thou hast wrong;
Who at twice ten hast sung more
Then some will doe at fourscore.
Cheere thee (honest Willy) then,
And begin thy Song agen.

WILLY.
Faine I would, but I doe feare
When againe my Lines they heare,
If they yeeld they are my Rimes,
They will faine some other Crimes;
And 'tis no safe ventring by,
Where we see Detraction ly.
For doe what I can, I doubt
Shee will picke some quarrell out;
And I oft have heard defended,
Little sayd, and soone amended.

ROGET.
See'st thou not in clearest dayes,
Oft thicke fogges could Heavens rayse?
And that vapours which doe breath
From the Earths grosse Wombe beneath,
Seeme not to us with blacke steames,
To pollute the Sunnes bright beames
And yet vanish into ayre,
Leaving it (unblemisht) faire?
So (my Willy) shall it bee
With Detractions breath and thee.
It shall never rise so hie,
As to staine thy Poesie.
As that Sunne doth oft exhale
Vapours from each rotten Vale;
Poesie so sometime draines,
Grosse conceits from muddy braines;
Mists of Envie, fogs of spight,
Twixt mens judgements and her light:
But so much her power may doo,
That she can dissolve them too.
If thy Verse do bravely tower,
As she makes wing, she gets power:
Yet the higher she doth sore,
Shee's affronted still the more:
Till she to the high'st hath past,
Then she restes with Fame at last.
Let nought therefore thee affright,
But make forward in thy flight:
For if I could match thy Rime.
To the very Starres I'de climb.
There begin againe, and flye,
Till I reach'd Aeternity.
But (alas) my Muse is slow:
For thy pace she flagges too low:
Yes, the more's her haplesse fate,
Her short wings were clipt of late.
And poore I, her fortune ruing,
Am my selfe put up a muing.
But if I my Cage can rid,
I'le flye where I never did.
And though for her sake I'me crost,
Though my best hopes I have lost,
And knew she would make my trouble
Ten times more than ten times double:
I would love and keepe her too
Spight of all the world could doe.
For though banisht from my flockes,
And, confin'd within these rockes,
Here I waste away the light
And consume the sullen Night,
She doth for my comfort stay,
And keepes many cares away.
Though I misse the flowry Fields,
With those sweets the Spring-tyde yeelds,
Though I may not see those Groves,
Where the Shepheards chaunt their Loves,
And the Lasses more excell,
Than the sweet-voyc'd Philomel,
Though of all those pleasures past,
Nothing now remaines at last,
But Remembrance (poore reliefe)
That more makes, than mends my griefe:
She's my minds companion still,
Maugre Envies evill will.
(Whence she should be driven to,
Wer't in mortals power to do.)
She doth tell me where to borrow
Comfort in the mid'st of sorrow;
Makes the desolatest place
To her presence be a grace;
And the blackest discontents
Be her fairest ornaments.
In my former dayes of bliss,
Her divine skill taught me this,
That from everything I saw
I could some invention draw:
And raise pleasure to her height,
Through the meanest objects sight.
By the murmure of a spring,
Or the least bough's rusteling.
By a daizie whose leaves spred,
Shut when Tytan goes to bed;
Or a shady bush or tree,
Shee could more infuse in mee,
Than all Natures beauties can
In some other wiser man.
By her helpe I also now,
Make this churlish place allow
Somethings that may sweeten gladnes
In the very gall of sadnes,
The dull loaneness, the blacke shade,
That these hanging vaults have made
The strange Musicke of the waves,
Beating on these hollow Caves,
This blacke Den which Rocks embosse
Over-growne with eldest Mosse.
The rude Portals that give light,
More to Terrour, then Delight.
This my Chamber of Neglect,
Wal'd about with Disrespect,
From all these, and this dull ayre,
A fit object for Despaire;
Shee hath taught me by her might,
To draw comfort and delight.
Therefore thou best earthly blisse,
I will cherish thee for this.
Poesie, thou sweetest content
That ere Heav'n to mortals lent:
Though they as a trifle leave thee,
Whose dull thoughts cannot conceive thee,
Though thou be to them a scorne,
That to nought but earth are borne,
Let my life no longer bee
Then I am in love with thee.
Though our wise ones call thee madnes,
Let me never taste of sadnes
If I love not thy mad'st fits,
Above all their greatest wits.
And though some too seeming holy,
Doe account thy raptures folly:
Thou dost teach me to contemne
What makes Knaves and Fooles of them.
Oh high power, that oft doth carry
Men above,

WILLY.
Good Roget tarry
I do fear thou wilt be gone
Quite above my reach anon;
The kind flames of Poesie
Have now borne thy thoughts so high
That they up in Heaven bee,
And have quite forgotten mee.
Call thy selfe to minde againe,
Are these Raptures for a Swaine,
That attends on lowly Sheepe,
And with simple Heards doth keepe?

ROGET.
Thankes my Willy; I had runne
Till that Time had lodg'd the Sunne,
If thou had'st not made me stay;
But thy pardon heere I pray.
Lov'd Apolo's sacred fire
Had rais'd up my spirits higher
Through the love of Poesy,
Then in deed they use to flye.
But as I sayd, I say still,
If that I had Willi's skill,
Envie nor Detractions tongue
Should ere make me leave my song:
But I'de sing it every day
Till they pin'd themselves away.
Be thou then advis'd in this,
Which both just and fitting is:
Finish what thou hast begun,
Or at least still forward runne.
Haile and Thunder ill hee'l beare
That a blast of winde doth feare:
And if words will thus afray thee,
Prethee how will deeds dismay thee?
Doe not thinke so rathe a song
Can passe through the vulgar throng,
And escape without a touch,
Or that they can hurt it much:
Frosts we see doe nip that thing
Which is forward's in the Spring:
Yet at last for all such lets
Somewhat of the rest it gets:
And I'me sure that so maist thou,
Therefore, my kinde Willy now,
Since thy folding time drawes on
And I see thou must be gon,
Thee I earnestly beseech
To remember this my speech
And some little counsell take,
For thy poore friend Rogets sake:
And I more of this will say,
If thou come next Holy-day.
