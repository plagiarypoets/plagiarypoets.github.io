One nymph there was, methought, in bloom of May,
On whom the idle Fiend glanced many a look,
In hopes to lead her down the slippery way
To taste of Pleasure's deep-deceitful brook:
No virtues yet her gentle mind forsook;
No idle whims, no vapours fill'd her brain;
But Prudence for her youthful guide she took,
And Goodness, which no earthly vice could stain,
Dwelt in her mind; she was ne proud, I ween, or vain.
