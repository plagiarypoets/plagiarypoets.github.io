Genius of Albion, still 'tis thine
To wield the sceptre of the Main;
Ev'n tho th' embattled world combine
To wrest it, the attempt proves vain.
Firm as an adamantine rock,
Thy Naval Prowess meets the shock,
And hurls, indignant, the recoiling blow,
Aim'd at thy envied head, on the confounded Foe.

Thy valiant Tars no dangers dread;
Still prompt to fly where Glory calls,
The canvas wing they proudly spread,
That wafts along thy Wooden Walls:
Nor castled streight, nor buoyless shoal,
Their dauntless ardour can controul;
Nor thund'ring batt'ries, whose tremendous roar
Ev'n shakes the solid frame of the resounding shore.

O'er the wide surface of the Globe,
Under each pole, beneath each zone,
To realms of every hue and robe,
Thy Maritime Renown is known.
The trembling East, the humbled West,
Have oft thy matchless might confess'd;
And soon the truant North again shall melt
To mildness, since her sons have Nelson's vengeance felt.

Yet still the soul of Pity shrinks
When the dread stroke ev'n Justice deals;
Upon the Widow's woes she thinks&mdash;
On all the hapless Orphan feels.
Amid the triumphs of the Brave
Death's sable flag is seen to wave;
And dire Misfortune mingles her alloy,
To damp, in many a heart, the cause of general joy!
