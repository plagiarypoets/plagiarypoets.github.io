I dream'd, but not in sleep &mdash; amid the sweetness
Of nature's exquistie beauties I walk'd on!
Flowers, birds, blue skies, bright sunshine, and the fleetness
Of the summer morning's breeze, which died upon
My brow &mdash; and I pour'd my young orison
To the Maker of earth's beauties.  Not alone
I worshipp'd him in bliss &mdash; for there was one
Kneeling on the same sod, whose moist eyes shone
On the blue Heavens to which her spotless soul had flown;

And her lips murmur'd out a holy prayer
Of thanks and blessings on the heads of those
Whom her heart shrined, and my poor soul was there,
Faintly but fondly, utter'd in the close
Of that most blest petition &mdash; we arose
With thoughts and hopes of which I cannot tell;
The heart is worldless when it overflows,
And deepest feelings still in silence dwell,
"Or speak in those sweet tears which from our full eyes swell."
