WRITTEN AFTER A THUNDERSTORM.
Last eve, along this still and silent sky,
The thunder-quivered Spirit of the Cloud
Launched his pale, awful arrows &mdash; every eye
Shrank from the fiery terrors, and the proud
Felt as the meek, while, rolling long and loud,
To dust the voice of the Invisible came&mdash;
That wordless voice at which the soul is bowed,
And sacred horror thrills the pulseless frame!
Then, then, we see, we feel, the LONELY NAME
Writ on the holy darkness &mdash; Deity
Sweeps the lit gloom on wings of cloud-born flame,
While all the echoes of the spheres reply!
The winds are silent &mdash; the mute deeps adore&mdash;
And Nature, shuddering, learns the Thunder's lore!

EVENING.
Beautiful Evening!  thy crystalline blue
On the calm waters of the pensive soul
Comes down in all its loveliness &mdash; each hue
That floats, like thought, from glimmering pole to pole,
Nectars the heart with Heaven, as if there stole
Soft falls of sapphire dew from the full sky:&mdash;
Yes, there are hours, when human pulses roll
Electric with brief immortality!
And see, once more the stars come forth on high&mdash;
Dew-drops of gold along their azure lea!
Oh!  who can hail their sacred light, nor sigh
To think no spirit of the dust is free&mdash;
To think how vainly Fancy still hath furled
Her baffled wing from that forbidden world?

MOONLIGHT.
Creation sleeps as beautiful as Death,
When Death has most of beauty &mdash; not a sound
Stirs the still silver; but a spirit's breath,
Without a voice, half seems to float around,
Breathing mute oracles from the blue profound, 
Where the sweet Lady of the Night rides high,
With a pale golden halo chastely crown'd:&mdash;
Forgive the dream, if, under such a sky,
Fancy hath heard sidereal harmony&mdash;
The faint, far music of the hymning spheres!
Forgive the dream, if e'er the enthusiast's eye
Hath turned  awhile from earthly hopes or fears,
To learn the language of that mystic scroll,
And read the starry secrets of the pole!
