How blythe, and how gay were the flowers,
When Colin appear'd on the green;
The blossoms burst forth in the bowers,
To heighten, and gladden the scene.

The birds were all perch'd on the sprays,
They crouded around in a throng,
Twas Colin inspir'd their lays,
His goodness invited their song.

No shepherd complain'd that his fleece,
Was ravish'd, or taken by fraud;
The vines were all cultur'd in peace,
The flocks never rambled abroad.

His cottage was Charity's home,
Soft Sympathy sat in the door,
Inviting the orphans to come,
And dealing out bread to the poor.

How sad in reverse is the gloom,
What tributes of sorrow are paid;
Ye shepherds, come weep on the tomb,
Where Colin the generous is laid.

New laurels forever shall spring,
From Gratitude incense shall rise;
Chaste Memory, rich honours shall bring,
To mark out the place where he lies.
