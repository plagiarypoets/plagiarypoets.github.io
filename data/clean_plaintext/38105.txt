I.
Spencer employ'd the Pow'r of Song
Lord Burleigh's shining Worth to wrong;
And Swift, with far more pow'rful Prose,
Made half the Nation Churchill's Foes.
But A&mdash;H&mdash;RST, blest with either Gift,
Slights Spencer's Fame, and spurns at Swift,
And over W&mdash;le triumphs greater
In Bunyan's Prose and Sternhold's Metre.

Cecil was blest with Cambdin's Praise,
And Montagu was crown'd with Bays.
In Verse, or Prose, each great Man's Name
Hath still been sanctify'd to Fame.
But W&mdash;le greater Glory owes
To Amh&mdash;rst, Foreman, Str&mdash;tt, his Foes,
Whose Morals give him Praise, in spite
Of all the Libels they can write.
