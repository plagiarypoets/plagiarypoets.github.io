Sweet instrument!  which fix'd in yellow teeth
So clear, so sprightly, and so gay is found,
Whether you breath along the shore of Leith,
Or Lowmond's lofty cliffs thy strains resound;
Struck by a taper finger's gentle tip,
Ah, softly in our ears thy pleasing murmurs slip!

Where'er thy lively music's found,
All are jumping, dancing round:
Ev'n trusty William lifts a leg,
And capers like sixteen with Meg;
Both old and young confess thy powerful sway,
They skip like madmen, and then frisk away.

Rous'd by the magic of the charming air,
The yawning dogs forego their heavy slumber;
The ladies listen on the narrow stair,
And Captain Andrew straight forgets his numbers.
Cats and mice give o'er their batt'ling,
Pewter plates on shelves are rattling;
But falling down, the noise my lady hears,
Whose scolding drowns the trump more tuneful than the spheres!
