If o'er the turf no trophy column rears
Sepulchral vase, no eulogy displays
Pride, silly fabling, o'er the full of years&mdash;
The early gone &mdash; who musingly surveys
This little mound, while mingled gems arrays
The mossy covert, as rude briar creeps
In bondage drear, finds sacred Truth pourtrays,
Unveil'd, 'tis home! &mdash; and gentle Pity weeps,
Ennobling the lone spot where kindred virtue sleeps.
