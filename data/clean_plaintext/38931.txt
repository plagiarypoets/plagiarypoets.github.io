In the dry desart of a leathern pocket
There yet remains a solitary shilling,
In his last retreat. &mdash; So lies the hunted stag,
In timorous, fearful mood, when in full cry
The bellowing hounds threaten his dissolution.
My honest, faithful, generous friend, come forth!
Joy of my heart, and pleasure of my eyes,
Thou royal stamp of Majesty divine,
Must thou dissolve?  Yes, time will have it so.
Here, waiter!  bring me change; be not dismay'd:
Thy being must have end, but not to-day;
The dogs will tear thee, and thy mangled limbs
Will soon be scatter'd o'er the joyless waste;
Yet, Phoenix like, thou shalt again revive,
Again shine forth, assume thy native splendor.
But let me charge thee (as my last request)
Mix not with vulgar coin; for ever shun
The impious hand that would, in iron chest,
Thy useful, humble services retard.
Now I dismiss thee; &mdash; oh, farewel for ever!
As lightning swift fly to some empty fob,
And, faithful still as thou hast been to me,
Assist where griping penury usurps;
For only there thy value can be known.
