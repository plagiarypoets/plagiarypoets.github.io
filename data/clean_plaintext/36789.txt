And this was Scotland's noblest son of song!
How calm his mien &mdash; how still his look!
Where be the flashes, bright and brief, yet strong,
Of mirth that revels, though the wise rebuke?
Tell me, thou limner, in what secret nook
Of this expanse of chasten'd countenance,
There lurk'd the gibe and jest which often shook
The stolid crowd &mdash; in wit's omnipotence?
Why live not these in this? &mdash; and where their recompense?

Lurks the rich treasure in that placid gaze&mdash;
In the deep meaning of these full-orb'd eyes&mdash;
In the veil'd lustre which, as through a haze
Of mellowing beauty, meekly lifts the guise
Of mere humanity, and shows what lies
In the far chambers of the soul still kept?
It does! &mdash; it does! &mdash; and, O!  more dear I prize
The soft, yet manly sadness that hath crept
O'er this, than would I all the heights by art o'erleapt.

Look!  what a brow soars o'er these arched spells,
That fix my gaze, they look so sad on me!
See!  where hid meaning into language swells
Upon those lips, that seem as tremblingly
To heave, as leaves upon a wind-woo'd tree!
Yet prophet power hath touch'd them with its fire;
With burning balm love dew'd them thrillingly!
Have they not blazed, like lightning on a pyre,
As from them flash'd the words that speak a patriot's ire?

O!  it is deeply true &mdash; no transient glance
Can tell the meaning of the poet's look;
For who shall say, who on one mood may chance
To wondering gaze, that he hath not mistook
The hue the moment's inspiration took,
For the deep shadows that from others hide
The broken hopes, the soul's self-urg'd rebuke,
Which in his breast for ever might abide,
Converting into gall, dear Burns!  thy heart's warm tide!
