Daughter of Plutus!  spangled power!
Thou ruler of the female breast,
Whose glittering domes at midnight hour,
The belles do throng, the beaux infest!
Bound in thy folly-woven chain,
The Proud are taught to be more vain;
And female sparklers inly groan,
If they abide not in dress, admired, and alone.

When Venus, first to send on earth
Beauty, her lovely child, design'd;
To thee she gave the heavenly birth,
And bade to form her infant mind.
Card-loving muse!  thy mystic lore
With patience fifteen years she bore;
The toilet's art thou bad'st her know;
From her own skill she learn'd her glowing form to show.

Lur'd to thy willing arms, they fly,
Self pleasing folly's idle brood,
Laughter, and noise, and thoughtless joy,
That leave no leisure to be good.
Quick they attend, and with them go
The proud coquette, the flatt'ring beau;
By thy complying throng receiv'd,
To each they vow their love, and are by none believ'd.

O, gently on thy suppliant's head,
Bright goddess, lay thy ring-deck'd hand;
Not in thy Persian glories clad,
Nor circled by the jewel'd band,
As by thy votaries thou art seen,
With lisping voice, and lanquid mein;
With quaver'd music's tuneful cry,
Scandal and lies, slander, and pompous vanity!

Folly, in motley garb array'd,
With ideot smile, and vacant stare;
And dissipation, listless maid,
With languid eye, that loves thy glare,
Still on thy mincing steps attend
And flattery, the would-be friend;
Self love, who holds himself so dear;
False pity, dropping soft the hypocritick tear!

Thy form benign, O Goddess, wear;
Thy milder influence impart!
Let friendship's sacred train be there,
To soften, and inspire the heart;
And playful mirth, and fancy wild,
Benevolence, and wisdom mild,
Good nature others' faults to scan,
Thus may I ever live, and prove myself a man!
