How sweet the hour of tranquil Solitude
To him who, weary of the world, would hide
Where never troubling storm, nor conflict rude,
Nor cold neglect, nor supercilious pride,
Should reach him more! &mdash; how sweet at eventide,
From toil escap'd, and ev'ry discord far,
To range the spangled mead, or river side,
Or murm'ring grove, where none, save twinkling star,
Or yellow moon, that thron'd in azure car
Looks down from heaven, can watch the falling tear;
And nought is heard of tumult that can mar
The little remnant of his comforts here,
His latest joy, and last sad solace known&mdash;
To wander sometimes thus, and muse, and weep alone!
