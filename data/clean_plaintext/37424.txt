Hail mild-ey'd morn, for thou art soft and fair
As breaks upon the bosom of the day,
Where the blue violet bears
Her bosom to the breeze.

Come, and the light-wing'd spring shall drop a smile,
Sweet Premature!  nurs'd on old Winter's breast,
Shall lift her blue-soft eye,
And wanton in the beam.

Lamp of the wintry world, thou Heav'n-lit Sun,
Oh!  haste and woo the young reluctant maid,
And bid her humid lip
Drop with the ripen'd balm.

Come chaste-ey'd God while yet the ice-hung clouds
Around thy throne in wintry glory ride,
The Virgin loves thy flight
While yet its blaze is dimm'd.

For soon, where glowing with the ardent fire
Of strong-soul'd passion, lo the seraph mind
Shrinks from the solar noon,
Gathers the sweets, and flies.

Propitious morn, my melancholy muse
Drops her cold tear upon the bloomless earth,
Reflecting man like thee
May totter to his tomb.

Yet even when Summer's flushing cheek was full,
I've seen the pale rose wither on her thorn,
And shrink, like injur'd worth
From sullen scornful pride.
