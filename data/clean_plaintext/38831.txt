I thought such a Ditty was writ
By some Shepherd, inspir'd by Pan:
Simplicity, Softness, and Wit,
Through each Stanza so prettily ran.

('Mongst the Grottoes, the Lawns, and the Plains,
Those Regions of Pleasure and Love;
Where Nature condoles with the Swains,
And the Nymphs tender Sentiments move.)

But when, undeceiv'd, I knew
'Twas a spiritual Shepherd that wrote;
Without e'er a Pause I guess'd who,
And trac'd you in every Thought.

Divinity sure must indite,
And Charity fire our Breast,
To compassionate Damon's sad plight;
And your Eloquence furnish the rest.

Assemblies dissolve into Joy,
And Philomel thinks she's above;
When your Thoughts Hallelujahs employ,
And a God, or a Heaven of Love.

But when you describe the last Day,
And dwell on the Regions of Woe;
An impartial Tribunal display,
And all the dire Terrors below:

Emotions swell every Breast,
And Tears of Repentance their Eyes;
Astonished Throngs are possess'd
With the Passions of Awe, and Surprize.

When disconsolate Damon, alone,
Thus utters in Silence his Sighs;
What Heart, that can feel, does not moan,
And in Sorrow and Sympathy rise?

Her Breast must be harder than Steel,
Not to soften with such a soft Muse:
'Twill soon make her Fortitude reel;
Sure Nisa can never refuse.

The Swain will soon have his desire;
The Courtship will soon have an end:
The Lady will Damon admire;
And Damon remember his Friend.
