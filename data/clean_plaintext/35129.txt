Within the windings of yon woody dale,
Beside a burnie, on a bonny green,
Where raws of whitening hawthorns scent the gale,
A wee bit canty theicket house is seen;
Fu' snug it stands frae angry winds, I ween,
Around, the stacks in riling cones appear,
Which shaw the owner thrifty is and bien,
Nae pride has he, nor heaps of worthless geer,
But routh o' kintra fare, the winter days to cheer.

Here stands the barn, to hoord the ripen'd gain,
With lowly roof, of strae and divets made,
Where aft the farmer wheels, with might and main,
The whirling flail, and nae ignoble trade:
And there the milk-house, where the dairy-maid
Aft skims the boyns, and presses out the whey;
And here a place, where carts and pleughs are laid;
And there the stable, for the horse and kye;
And here the hen-house stands, and there the stinking stye.

Into the ha' house if ye chance to keek,
Ye'll tent the ingle blinkin bonnily,
The crazy rafters, painted o'er wi' reek;
A twa-arm'd chair within the neuk ye'll see,
Where aft the guidman leans, wi' meikle glee,
And smoaks his pipe, and tells his pawky tale;
An antic ambry, made of aiken tree,
Wi' caps and luggies, rang'd upon a dale,
And meikle toop-horn spoons, and plates to haud the kail.

Ben i' the spence, for parlour hae they nane,
The wa's are brawly whiten'd o'er wi' lime;
A polish'd chimla, and a clean hearth stane;
A looking-glass, a clock to met the time;
A curtain'd bed, and eke a cupboard prime:
The house contains nae mae fligairy things,
(For luxury is sure an unco crime)
Yet, frae this little wealth, contentment springs,
And thro' the roof, the voice of discord never rings.
