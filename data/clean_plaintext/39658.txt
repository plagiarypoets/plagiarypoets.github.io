I.
'Twas at the feast for City Honours won,
By TOM M'KENNY'S Son;
Aloft, in starch'd-up state,
The New Lord Mayor sate,
On the old Mansion Throne:
The Viceroy and his Sec. were there,
(A common compliment to Dublin's Mayor,
Ev'n should a wig-block fill the chair;)
The Aldermen had tir'd their jaws,
The Sheriffs carv'd with vast applause,
And Guilds-men stuff'd their hungry maws.
Happy, happy, happy wights!
None ever saw,
None ever saw,
None ever saw &mdash; such trencher Knights.
Chorus &mdash; Happy, &amp;c.

II.
The Band were plac'd on high,
In truly piteous state,
As doom'd to play, while others ate
Some sav'ry dish, ragout, or pie
Oh cruel, cruel Fate.
At length the dinner pass'd,
And toasting Healths came on at last,
The bumpers circulated fast:
And with this glorious Corporation fun,
Came many a joke, and many a pun;
For Norbury, with jolly face,
Maintain'd Chief Justice Joker's place.
But hark! ... all mirth and joy is past&mdash;
The band strike up a loyal tune, the Mayor looks aghast!
All loyal hearts admire the well-known sound,
"The Mayor is frantic!" now they shout around,
"The Mayor is frantic!"  all the Mansion roofs rebound!
In furious state,
Now hear him prate,
Like braggart host,
He puffs and boasts,
And shakes his empty pate.

III.
"Silence," said he, "that strain &mdash; let none presume to-day
A loyal toast to give, or tune to play;
Change ye that tune &mdash; it only serves
To shock the Rebels' tender nerves;
I would not, for my ears,
Alarm a Croppy's fears,
Or hurt the man who from allegiance swerves.
Who has dar'd, thus underhand,
Tamper with the City Band?
Now your City's low in treasure,
I'll enforce my sov'reign pleasure;
Low your treasure,
Sweet the pleasure,
Sweet the pleasure to command."
Chorus &mdash; "Now your," &amp;c.

IV.
The Viceroy thought the Mayor craz'd;
The Secretary look'd amaz'd;
And three-and-twenty Aldermen at Tom M'Kenny gaz'd.
The Band all saw the madness rise,&mdash;
His hideous looks, his furious eyes;
They chang'd the tune, and quickly play'd
His darling air, "The White Cockade;"
It sounds did soon impart
A solace to his heart;
But still, its much-lov'd notes excite
A thought of NINETY-EIGHT.
Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,
Fallen &mdash; in quite chop-fallen state,
Poor Tom's dejected quite.&mdash;
(When loyal Corps, their efforts tried,
To stop Rebellion's gory tide,
Which of their lists, although so many,
Enrolled thy name, O Tom M'Kenny?)
In mournful musing now the mayor sate;
For when he thought of valued friends,
Who THEN were laid so low;
Cut off by most untimely ends,
His tears began to flow.
Chorus &mdash; For when, &amp;c.

V.
But Friendship now, with Heav'nly balm,
Came in, disturbing thoughts to calm;
HARVEY stept up, with prompt relief,
And kindly cheer'd our City's Chief;
Softly sweet he whisper'd to him,
Such weak conduct must undo him,
"In tears," said he, "why should they flow,
For scenes of twenty years ago;
Cheer up, my dear M'Kenny, cheer,
Come raise your head, and dry your eyes;
For, save myself, there's not one here
In all your sorrows sympathize.
Talbot, Grant, and Blunt beside thee,
Meath, and Bradford, all deride thee."
Thus were the sorrows of our Dublin May'r
Lull'd by Phil. Harvey's tender love and care.
The May'r, unable quite to hide his pain,
Gaped wide at Phil,
Who sooth'd him still,
Then sigh'd and look'd, sigh'd and look'd,
Sigh'd and look'd, and sigh'd again;
At last, with folly, grief, and wine opprest,
M'Kenny sunk on Harvey's faithful breast.
Chorus &mdash; The May'r, &amp;c.

VI.
Not long reclin'd our worthy May'r,
For sounds like thunder make him wildly stare;
He marvels what these sounds can be,
And hears distinctly "Glorious Memory!"
Hark, hark!  the hated sound
Has rais'd up his head,
As awak'd from the dead,
And amaz'd, he stares around.
"The Memory," still old Archer cries;
The Mayor now stands up,
And to slight William's name,
Hear him loudly proclaim,
"Here's a bumper, so fill ev'ry cup!"
But instead of the toast,
Which all loyalists boast,
The toast that he gave was "St. Paddy's dear Mother!"
The Nobles now, who grac'd
This wond'rous City feast,
Rise with one accord,
And depart from his board,
With indignation at the ribald jest.&mdash;
But hear, our shuffling, paltering host,
Tells why he gave not such a glorious toast;
"Behold my list, and it will plainly shew,
"King William's name I wrote, but then I wrote it low."
Trickster! &mdash; 'tis in vain;
To all the world 'tis plain,
HE COULD NOT LOVE KING GEORGE, WHO PLAC'D KING WILLIAM SO!

VII.
The feast is o'er,
And days are past, now three or four:
Hark!  hark!  the City drums
M'Kenny to the Sessions come!!!
The mob attends.&mdash;
Oh!  what a train of most uproarious friends!
But where the Aldermanic Board,
Who used to wait upon "My Lord?"
Where's Trevor?  Warner?  where is Abbot gone?&mdash;
All who were on the judgment seat,
At Tom's approach, make quick retreat,
And leave the GLORIOUS MAN, so gloriously &mdash; ALONE.
And now may ev'ry future May'r
Take warning by this job,
And when he fills the City Chair,
Not stoop to please &mdash; a mob.
