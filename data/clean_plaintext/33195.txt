FAVONIUS.
This more is than seeminge bolde;
Such the Heroes [were] of old.
His name Sr Arthur, and in field
A crowned Lion on his sheild.
Wisdome and Justice then, wch call
Sr Sapient and Artegall
virtues twines, whose upright hands
Atlass like uphold all lands,
Keepe ye world, it does not run
To the old confusion.
Next Sr Guion doth advance
The golden Virtue Temperance.
Last in Ranck, but not the least,
One that joyned to the rest
Does relish them and make them right,
Calidore the curteous Knight.
Musicke, straine a note devine;
Appeare, you virtues masculine.
