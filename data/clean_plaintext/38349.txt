The lengthen'd sand, the desart tract of life,
Which bears no landmark but a drear old age,
No waters but the troubled stream of strife
To cheer us on our weary pilgrimage,
And passion's fev'rish calenture assuage;
Ay!  who can look on this, and bless the day
Which bade him in these scenes of woe engage!
No, rather let him early steal away,
And stop his course ere yet he falls, misfortune's prey!

And yet there are some thinly scatter'd flowers,
Which bud and blossom in this tainted air;
Nurs'd by the milder gales and softer showers,
The Violet rears her maiden honours there,
Far from the haunts to which rude steps repair.
Sweet flower!  I love thy modest secrecy,
And ever in my garland thee will bear;
Still unregarded by the idler lie,
But still thy charms reveal to one adoring eye!

Oh!  let me find thy rich and purfled flower
There where thou liest, in some sequester'd vale;
And I will shield thee from the wintry hour,
And bear thee to my garden's quiet pale,
And hide thy buds where no rude storms assail;
Then round the moss-grown stone I'll bid thee twine,
Teach thee, at nightfall clos'd, the sun to hail,
And watch thy silent  growth with careful eyne:
Oh!  come to me, sweet flower, and let me call thee mine!
