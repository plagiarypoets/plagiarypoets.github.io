O!  that I could as I would aeternize her,
It rather fitts ye Faery Queenes deviser,
Or him who made his Delia of such fame,
Or English Bartas Sylvester by name
Or:  haut fitz: Gefferie worthy Drakes Learnd Honour
Or if Mellifluous Drayton would bemoan her:
Your Silver Penns can best depaint her honer
Yee Phenix feathered Muses of our Time
Eternise her:  with your eternall Rime;
O!  shame of griefe vertue' in oblivion lyes:
Els had Eliza' had her due Eligies
True Elegies wch:  shd:  ye skies have Peirst
Had DANIEL, Drayton, Silvester them verst
Or els Fitz: Gefferie whose muse coelestiall
Would penetrate Heaven, Hell, Sea, Earth, and all.

her Noble Daughter':  yong beautious Baroness Ross:
Is mov'd to Marrie whom shee held furll deere,
A Gallant squire Nephew of a mightie Peere
"And on whose mightie shoulders most did rest,

As ye wide compass of ye frimament,
On Atlas mightie shoulders is upstaid:"
