Inspire me in this taske (JHOVES seede I pray)
With Hippocrenes drops besprinke my head,
To comfort me upon this tedious way,
And quicken my cold braine nigh dull and dead;
Direct my wandring spirits, when they stray,
Least forren and forbidden paths they tread:
My journey's tedious, (blame not then my feares)
My voyage, aymes at many thousand yeares.

Oh give me leave, from the Worlds first Creation,
The ancient names of Britons, to derive
From Adam, to the Worlds first Inundation,
And so from Noah, to us that yet survive:
And having of Troyes Worthies made relation,
Your spurs the Chariot of my Muse must drive
Through all past Ages, and precedent times,
To fill this new World with my worthlesse rymes.

Oh, may these Artlesse numbers in your eares,
(Renowmed JAMES) seeme Musically strung,
Your fame (oh JOVES-star'd Prince) spread every where,
First gave my still and speech-lesse Muse a tung:
From your Majestike vertues (prised deare,)
The infant life of these harsh meeters sprung;
Oh, take not then their industrie in skorne,
Who, but to emblaze you, had beene yet unborne.

Not let your Princely Peeres hold in disdaine,
To have their Auncestry stild'e and inrolde
In this poore Register, a higher straine
Their merits aske, since brazen leaves unfold
Their never-dying Fame, yet thus much daine,
Not to despise to heare your vertues told
In a plaine stile, by one, whose wish and hart,
Supplies in zeale, want both of Skill and Art.

Times faithfully conferd, the first invention
Of most thinges now in use, heare you shall finde,
Annext with these, the use and comprehention
Of Poesie, once to the Goddes desceind,
Suffer our bluntnesse then, since our intention
Is to good use, sent from a zealous mind.
If Stones in Lead set, keepe their vertues:  then,
Your worth's the same, though blazde by a rude Pen.
