INVOCATION.
Say, SCOTA, Thou that anes upon a day
Gar'd Allan Ramsay's hungry hart strings play
The merriest sangs that ever yet were sung,
Pity anes mair, for I'm outthrow as clung.
'Twas that grim gossip, chandler chafted want,
With threed-bair claithing, and an ambry scant,
Made him cry o' thee, to blaw throw his pen,
Wi' leed, that well might help him to come ben,
An' crack amo' the best of ilka sex,
An' shape his houghs to gentle bows and becks.
He wan thy heart, well wordy o't poor man,
Take yet another gangrell by the hand;
As gryt's my mister, an' my duds as bair,
And I as fib as he was ilka hair:
Mak me but half as canny, there's no fear,
Tho' I be auld, but I'll yet gather gear.

O gin thou hadst not heard him first o'erwell,
When he got maughts to write The Shepherd's Tale,
I meith ha had some chance of landing fair,
But O that sang, the mither of my care!
What wad I geen, that thou hadst put my thumb,
Upo' the well tauld tale, till I had come;
Then led my hand alongst it line for line,
O to my dieing day, how I wad shine;
An' as far yont it, as syn Habbi plaid,
Or Ga'an on Virgil matchless skill display'd:
An' mair I wadna wiss.  But Ramsay bears
The gree himsel, an' the green laureals wears:
Well mat he brook them, for piece ye had spair'd,
The task to me, Pate meith na been a laird:
'Tis may be better, I's take what ye gee
Ye're nae toom handed gin your heart be free:
But I's be willing as ye bid me write,
Blind horse they say ride hardy to the fight;
And by good hap, may come awa, but scorn
They are na kempers a' that shear the corn.
Then Scota heard, and said your rough spun ware
Sounds but right douft an' fowsome to my ear;
Do ye pretend to write like my ain bairn,
Or onie ane that wins beyont the Kairn;
Ye're far mistaen gin ye think sick a thought,
The Gentle Shepherd's nae sae easy wrought;
There's seenes an' acts, there's drift an' there's design,
An' a' maun like a new ground whittle shine;
Sick wimpl'd wark, would crack a pow like thine.
Kind mistris, says I, gin this be your fear,
Charge nae mair shot, than what the piece'll bear.
Something but seenes or acts, than kittle game,
Yet what may please, bid me sit down an' frame,
Gae, then; she says, nor deave me with your dinn,
PUFF &mdash; I inspire you, sae you may begin.
If ye oe'r forthersome, turn tapsie turvy
Blame you ain haste, an' say not that I spur ye.
But sound and feelfu' as I bid you write,
An' ready hae you pen when I indite:
Speak my ain leed, 'tis gueed auld Scots I mean,
Your Southren gnaps, I count not worth a preen.
We've words a fouth, that we can ca' our ain,
Tho' frae them now my childer fair refrain.
An' are to my gueed auld proverb confeerin,
Neither gueed fish nor flesh, nor yet fa't herrin.
Gin this ye do an lyn your rime wi' sense
But ye'll make friends of freemet fouk, fa' kens?
Wi' thir injunctions ye may set you down:
Mistress, says I, I'm at your bidding boun.

Sae I begins, my pen into my hand,
Just ready hearkning, as she should command.
But then about her, there was sic a dinn,
Some seeking this, some that, some out som in.
That its nae wonder, tho' I aft gae wrang,
An' for my ain, set down my neiper's sang,
For hundreds mair were learning at her school,
And some wrote fair, an' some like me wrote foul.
