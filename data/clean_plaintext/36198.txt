There are strange truths in dreams, and last midnight
I dreamed I saw three Spirits on the shore
Of Ocean, gleaming in the silver light
Of its phosphoric billows, &mdash; One, that wore
The look of genius, when it longs to soar,
Casting impatient glances at the sky;
And one, that stooped and listened to the roar,
With pale, sweet lips, yet opened in a sigh,
As if she were feared its stern inclemency.

And there was one, that listened not, nor gazed,
But stood with down-fixed eye and folded arm,
Fevered with thoughts that on his sunk cheek blazed.
The younger Spirit came in soft alarm,
And soothed the sufferer, and her cheek grew warm
As his; &mdash; and as her slender hand she gave,
It trembled. &mdash; Did the charmer feel the charm?
That dark-eyed beauty, was she passion's slave?
Then, ere they rose, this chant flow'd on the wave:&mdash;

When shall we three meet again?
When my pinion's fiery vane,
Leaving many in an antique tower,
Gilded hall and rosy bower,
Fortress proud, and marble shrine,
Throned on Alp and Apennine,
Hovers o'er this emerald main&mdash;
Then shall we three meet again!

When shall we three meet again?
When I break my heartless chain,
Leaving mighty mountains, given
To prop the purple dome of heaven;
Idol temples starred with gems,
Shores of pearl, and sacred streams
From the crystal caverns roll'd;
Where the Indian sleeps on gold:
Finding all their glories vain&mdash;
Then shall we three meet again!

When shall we three meet again?
When its fire has left this brain,
When this heart can think unmoved
On all it loved and lost &mdash; yet loved;
When its found of tears is dry,
When its home is yonder sky;
Long before your task is done,
There shall rest this weary one;
Crowned with pleasure &mdash; yet in pain,
Till we three meet again!
