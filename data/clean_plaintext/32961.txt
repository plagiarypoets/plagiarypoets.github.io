Strange-headed Monsters, Painters have described.
To which the Poets strange parts have ascribed,
As Janus first two faces had assign'd him,
Of which, one look't before, tother behind him:
So men, may it be found in many places,
That underneath one hood can beare two faces.
Three-headed Cerberus, Porter of Hell,
In faind with Pluto, God of wealth to dwell.
So still with greatest States, and men of might,
Dogs dwell, that doe both fawne, and bark, and bite.
Like Hydras heads, that multiply with wounds,
Is multitude, that mutinie confounds:
On what sev'n-headed beast the Strumpet sits,
That weares the scarfe, sore troubleth many wits,
Whether sev'n sinnes be meant, or else sev'n hils,
It is a question fit for higher skils.
But then of these, if you can rightly conster,
A headlesse woman is a greater Monster.
