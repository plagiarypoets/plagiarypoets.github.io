Eftsone, wordlinge, shewe to me
The ymage of Inconstancye;
'Tis not woman, 'tis not wynde,
'Tis nothynge of the lyvynge kynde,
Nothynge in the sea nor ayr,
Nothynge foule, ne nothynge fayre;
I telle thee, in my lowly rhyme,
'Tis nothynge else but father Tyme;
Father Tyme appeares to me
The ymage of Inconstancye.
Thys momente here, next momente gonne,
Always begynnynge, never donne;
Brynges us hope and joye to-daye,
To-morrowe snatches bothe awaye
Like an arrowe through the skie,
Father Tyme he passethe bye:
Who can stoppe his eagle-flygte,
Dartynge onne the wings of lyghte?
Counte not, seely man, his hours,
Rather strewe his path with floweres;
Floweres which Love to Beauty gyves,
When in blisse with Youthe he lyves;
Floweres I no more must hope to see
Till Tyme shall brynge my Fayre to me.
Hasten, thou god with arched scythe,
Hasten with step so quick and blythe,
That she I love with all her charmes
May blesse her swayne's impatiente armes!
Let him but listen to my rhyme,
And I will shew to father Tyme,
What he is not, nor e'er can be,
The emblemme of sweete Constancye;
'Tis a mayde so fayre and trewe
That Tyme himself mighte stoppe to viewe;
I will not her name imparte,
But 'tis she who rules my herte.
Not the sun, great source of lyghte,
Not the moon, who shynes by nyghte,
Not the seasons as they move
Are more trewe than she I love;
She I love appeares to me
The emblemme of sweete Constancye.
Worldlinge, adewe!  this is my theme,
My wakinge thought, my nightlye dreme.
