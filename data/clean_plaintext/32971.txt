Thow monster of mankinde, obscurer of good name,
Thow hated childe of pride, and autor of thy shame,
Whose heares are stinging snakes, whose face is pale and wann,
With scornfull eyes and browes, disdaining everie mann,
With canker taynted tethe, and poysoned tongue of spight,
With vile detracting lipps, defaming everie wighte,
With breth of Sulphures smell, fedd with revenges desire,
With brests defyld with gall, and hart of flaminge Ire,
Whose nayles are harpies clawes, and bodie leane and spare,
Which never smiles, beinge still opprest with greife and care,
Whose frettinge pynes thy hart, and eates thy flesh awaie,
Still feeding on thy self, till thow dost cleane decaye
Like burning Aetna monte, which with his stinking fumes
Feedes on it self, and with his flame it self consumes.
Thy force ech sowle doth feele, thoughe, to thy better paine,
Except the mann deject, whome fortune doth disdaine.
