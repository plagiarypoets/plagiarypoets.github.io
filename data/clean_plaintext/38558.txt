Last Midsummer morn, as I stray'd thro' the grove,
Young Dolly I met by the way;
I told her her charms had subdu'd me with love,
And caus'd her awhile for to stray.

Silly Damon, she cried, what would you be at?
Your fooling give over, I pray;
For all your fond wooing, your cooing, and chat,
No longer shall make me delay.

Then I press'd her hand close, saying, can you deny
A favour so striking as this?
But still she rejected, and cried out, oh fie!
When I eagerly stole a sweet kiss.

With rapture I gaz'd on her delicate charms,
(For I could not resist it, I vow;)
Then clasping her lovingly in my fond arms,
Said she, I must go to my cow.

Then away o'er the plain together we went
'Till come to a cool river side;
Where we tarried awhile, 'till I gain'd her consent,
For ever to be my true bride.

Adieu!  then, ye trouble, and plagues of this life,
With Dolly I sure shall be blest;
For when that kind Providence makes her my wife,
We'll lull all our cares into rest.
