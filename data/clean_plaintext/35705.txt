Exulting Freedom, now at last, has found
Her best ally, Religion.  Oft by foes
(Tho' seeming friends) to fatal errour led,
She deem'd her an inveterate foe, and oft
With blinded frenzy, bent her utmost rage
Against a phantom by the Stygian spell
Of the old wizard skilfully disguis'd
In fair Religion's garb.  Thus MULLA'S bard
The ancient wiles of ARCHIMAGO sung
Against the Red-cross knight, whom, in the form
Of UNA fair the false DUESSA led
To foul misdeemings of his plighted spouse.
He thought her false, but soon a mightier hand
Baffled the charm, the slanders were dispell'd,
The Stygian imp that in her 'semblance long
With supersitious rites the world beguil'd,
Touch'd by her presence, like a shape of snow,
Or cloud-wrapt Phantom in a morning dream,
Evanish'd into nought.  Thus FREEDOM saw
Religion's charms.  He saw the wizard's wile
That long deceiv'd his sight.  A suppliant now
He own'd her power, confest his sad mistake,
And courted reconcilement; nor was she
Averse.  Applauding angels in their orbs,
And heavenly choirs the Hymenean sung,
Join'd by a symphony of happy swains.
Instead of palaces and towns, the haunts
Of luxury, the happy woodlands saw
The blessed nuptials, and among the hinds
Their elder progeny was nurst, a race,
Manly, robust, and bold, for hardihood
Long celebrated, but uncultur'd, stern,
More from their father's rough austerity
Than from their mother's soft benevolence
And manners bland inheriting.  But soon
A generous tendril on the savage stock
Ingrafted, from its vigour wild inhal'd
Due nourishment, which, mellow'd by the lapse
Of genial years, to coming times shall bear
Fruits worthy of paradise, if culture due,
The liberal breath of heaven, the chemic sun,
And timely showers, their friendly aid combine.
