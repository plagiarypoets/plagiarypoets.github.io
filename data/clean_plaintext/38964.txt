From the West, where Dee &mdash; the princely halls
Of Easton leaving, and its fair domains&mdash;
Close at my garden's foot by Cestria's walls,
Rolls his full tide, I turn to other plains&mdash;
Where, throned in rural quiet, Nature reigns;
And as I rove her happy scenes among,
Not one light sigh my gladdened spirit deigns
(Though some were valued) to the city-throng;
Here purer sweeps the breeze, here flows a softer song.

Mark'd from my window, at the call of Spring,
The bursting orchard spreads its gaudiest bloom;
The lambkin bleats, the rook is on the wing,
And every twittering hedge-row breathes perfume;
And from each nectar'd flower ascends the hum,
Where clustering thick, the busy hive is met;
In yellow lustre glows he golden broom,
'Mid the dark grass the primrose-star is set,
And on its dewy bank sleeps the sweet violet.

But chiefly here, thou blue-resounding main,
I see, I hear, as with yon rocky bar,
Which flings its arms athwart thy mighty reign,
Vainly thou wagest an eternal war;
Thy foamy crest is visible afar,
The fisher's skiff is tossing on the surge:
Here giant crags oppose thy billows' jar,
Whence their scar'd flight the screaming sea-mews urge;
There Scarbro's castled cliff indents the horizon's verge.

Yet lovelier far, and welcomer to me,
Whom late I left in autumn's sere decay,
Mourning my loss &mdash; Mine own Acacia tree,
Thou hail'st me back in all thy green array!
O still thy tall and graceful stem display,
When He who rear'd to other worlds is gone&mdash;
Memorial of a master pass'd away,
Wave still thy boughs; in lieu of funeral stone,
O be his name by thee to coming days made known!
