I.
From Bedlam's walls I saw thee stray,
A melting, trembling, constant prey
To ev'ry human woe!
Becalm thy grief, feel moderate pain,
Lest frantic fancy burst thy brain,
And make thyself thy foe!

II.
If mis'ry's guests, in yonder gaol,
Demand thy tear, distract thy soul,
Let anguish not destroy!
But learn a rule, by reason taught,
That pain's worst torture lies in thought,
Which madmen can't employ!

III.
In vain &mdash; advice but moves thee more,
I see it lies beyond thy pow'r,
To check the rising sigh!
Then in thy grief I'll bear a part,
Perhaps I thus may ease thy heart,
And clear thy misty eye!
