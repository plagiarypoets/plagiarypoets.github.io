'Twas at the GROCER'S Feast for INDIA won
By CHATHAM'S beardless son,
Aloft, in luscious state,
The virgin Statesman sate
On barley-sugar throne;
Fat Aldermen were pac'd around,
Their brows with spreading antlers bound,
(So City Spouses should be crown'd)&mdash;
The gentle GRENVILLE by his side
Sate, like a pursy DUTCHMAN'S bride,
And two vast chairs contain'd his vast backside!
Welcome, welcome, welcome guests!
Eat while ye may,
Eat while ye may,
Eat while ye may!
Ne'er will ye more behold such feasts!

The God-like PRETTYMAN hard by,
Amid the festive band,
At once begin to sing, and lie&mdash;
The lies, the notes, ascend as high
As themes like his demand!
The song began from TEMPLE'S toil,
Who less his STOWE'S enchanting soil,
(Strong Coalition's pow'r to foil!)
GUY VAUX'S dark disguise the Peer bely'd:&mdash;
Up the back-stairs unseen he hid,
When he to GEORGE'S closet prest,
To share the Sorrows of his Royal breast&mdash;
Then issued forth the dread command:&mdash;
"PRELATES, defend your KING! &mdash; Arm, arm, BED CHAMBER BAND!"
The list'ning Cits admire the loyal sound!
"Another BUCKINGHAM!" they shout around&mdash;
"Another BUCKINGHAM!" the plaistered roofs rebound!
With ravish'd ears
Youg BILLY hears:&mdash;
And says "A fig
For ev'ry Whig!"
Askance his Chaplain leers!

The praise of ARDEN next the Bard enraptur'd sung!
O glorious eloquence of ARDEN'S tongue!
Lo, where the legal wonder comes!&mdash;
"Waiters!  a fresh supply of plumbs!"
With more than mortal grace
He shews his noseless face!&mdash;
Ah nose! &mdash; of far more worth than ROLLO'S thumbs!
PEPPER, in the blood-stain'd field,
Raving ROLLO'S rage repell'd!&mdash;
Heroes never mind their noses;
Both his thumbs great ROLLO loses!
DEVON'S glory
Flies before ye!
Triumph, PEPPER! &mdash; ROLLO, yield!
Sooth'd with the sound, the youth grew vain!
Scarce wish'd his friend a nose again!
And thrice his triumphs he renew'd o'er Freedom's prostrate train!
The SECRETARY sourly smil'd,
To see such pertness in his child!
And while he NORTH and FOX defy'd,
Chang'd his hand, and check'd his pride!

Prophetic, he foreshows
The MODERN PHOEBUS'S woes,
He sung Sir CECIL, matchless bard,
By Westminster Electors
Scouted, scouted, scouted, scouted!
'Spite of all his great Protectors,
His gratitude's reward.
Deserted in his utmost need,
In vain he seeks to rear his head;
In vain he seeks to scrutinize,
E'en MURPHY dares not back his lies,
All melancholy sat the angry Boy,
Revolving in his mind
The fickle temper of JOHN BULL;&mdash;
Nor now to sweetmeats felt inclin'd,
Nor eat his belly-full.

The rev'rend Lyrist joy'd to see,
That Love was in the next degree;
But, ah!!! &mdash;
DESUNT CAETERA.
