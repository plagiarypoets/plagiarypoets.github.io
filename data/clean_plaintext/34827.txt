Virgin, brighter than the morning,
Haste and finish thy adorning!
Hymen claims his promised day,&mdash;
Come from thy chamber, come away!

Roses strew, and myrtles bring,
Till you drain the wasted Spring;&mdash;
The altars are already drest,
The bower is fitted for its guest,
The scattered rose begins to fade,&mdash;
Come away, reluctant maid!

See what a war of blushes breaks
O'er the pure whiteness of her cheeks;
The shifting colours prove by turns
The torch of Love unsteady burns.
Pleading now, now lingering, fainting,
Her soft heart with fear is panting;&mdash;
Cling not to thy mother so,
Thy mother smiles, and bids thee go.

Mind not what thy maidens say;
Though they chide the cruel day,
Though they weep, and strive to hold thee
From his arms that would enfold thee;
Kiss, and take a short farewell,&mdash;
They wish the chance to them befell.

Mighty Love demands his crown
Now for all his sufferings done;
For all Love's tears, for all his sighs,
Thyself must be the sacrifice.
Virgin, brighter than the day,
Haste from thy chamber, come away!
