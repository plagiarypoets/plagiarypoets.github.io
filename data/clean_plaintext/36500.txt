I do remember well an eventide
In autumn &mdash; oh!  it was a lovely scene,
Pensive, yet beautiful &mdash; the summer's pride
Of foliage, from one mass of waving green,
Was fading into rich variety:  between
Luxuriant meadows, o'er which hung a veil
Of clear attenuated mist, was seen
The sparkling river, where one distant sail
Spread its white canvas to the rising vesper gale.

And Sunset on the adjacent hills was flinging
A radiance soft as Love's last parting smile,
And in the distance village bells were ringing,
Swelling to spirit-thrilling tones awhile;
Then hush'd to silence that might well beguile
The sorrows of the breast, and make of woe
That pure emotion no ill thoughts defile,
The "Joy or Grief," which we would not forego
For all th' illusive bliss that Mirth can e'er bestow.

And on th' illustrious scene was gazing one,
Beautiful as the genii of the hour,
Her glance was fixed on the declining sun,
Dismantled now of all his dazzling power,
Her head was bending like the golden flower
That drinks the sunset rays, &mdash; her dark-fringed eye
Gleam'd like the heaven which April's transient shower
Has burnish'd into liquid brilliancy&mdash;
Her eye-lash still retained a glittering tear of joy!

She was a moment pale &mdash; but the rich blood
Soon painted on her cheek an eloquent blush,
And by the current of that mantling flood,
The eye could trace the instantaneous rush
Of thoughts across her spirit, like the gush
Of waters from a newly-opened spring&mdash;
Her soul lit up her beauty in that blush
Which seem'd o'er the unconscious heart to fling
A spell that evermore would round it firmly cling.

Then suddenly, as if she were awaking
From the creation of some heavenly dream,
She looked as though a passionate farewell taking
Of daylight's orb, whose last delicious beam
Shed round her form etherial a rich stream
Of sunny glory, while an exquisite shade
Of auburn hair fell on her; but the gleam
Of her white swan-like neck o'er which it strayed
Was often by the swelling southern breeze display'd.

One moment &mdash; and the lovely thing had flown;
I knelt upon the spot where she  had been,
And gaz'd upon the darkening Heaven alone,
Till sparkled in the firmament serene
The evening star.  I felt around me thrown
A chain my spirit once had scorn'd to own.
The scene is past &mdash; but it must ever be
Enshrined in memory &mdash; it must give a tone
To every future feeling &mdash; I shall see,
None like the bright form which she appeared to me!
