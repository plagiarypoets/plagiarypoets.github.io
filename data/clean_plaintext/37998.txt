Is there a heart in such an hour as this,
When beauty gloweth in the firmament,
Which feels not something more than common bliss?&mdash;
As if heaven o'er the earth in kindness bent,
And kissed away its sorrows.  Love has lent
His gorgeous, richest colours, spreading far
As thought can follow in its wide extent.
Shot on the ethereal stream, each rising star
Brings home sweet thoughts to those who distant wandering are.
