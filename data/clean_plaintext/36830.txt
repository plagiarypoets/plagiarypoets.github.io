Thou mighty pow'r unseen, yet felt and heard
(For now I feel thy pinions cross my cheek,
And hear thy voice, and oft articulate word,
At lonely midnight have I heard thee speak;)
O stay thy rapid footsteps, for I seek
To know thee, and from whence thou comest, and where
Thy going is, when thou hast ceased to break,
With the wild strife of elemental war,
Light zephyr's soft repose, calm slumbering in the air.

In Ocean's gloomy caverns dost thou dwell?
Or is thy habitation in the skies?
What mystic form does herald thy assail
To the bold seaman, ere the waves arise
To mountain billows, and the vessel flies,
Like a sear leaf before thy withering blast?
O thou art wonderful!  thought prostrate lies
Before thee as a deity:  how fast
Thou hast been hurrying past me, yet thou art not past!

All things created have a form but thee.
How like a God the sun pursues his way
Diffusing life and beauty!  but we see
From whence proceeds the vivifying ray:
Thy steps are on the ocean, on the earth,
And far above, the clouds thy will obey.
Before the heaven and earth, wert thou brought forth?
Or, did this globe, in space, produce thy mighty birth?

Of all the created things, within the ken
Of human knowledge, thou resemblest most
The Great Original; and there are men,
So far in their own mazy reasoning lost,
Who say, thou art the Mighty One, that dost
Guide with a skilful hand this ponderous earth.
How wild and weak the subtle reasoners boast!
The same Almighty Cause did give thee birth,
That brought the globe, the heaven, and all existence forth.
