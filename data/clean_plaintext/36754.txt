Like the sad-hearted minstrel of the Moon,
Who will not pour her misanthropic lay
Until the Night grows upward to its noon,
And the winds hymn the death-song of the day;
But silent all, in woodlands far away,
A little hermit sits within her cell,
Mossy and dim, where no intruding ray
Peeps through the solitude she loves so well:
Like her, the sweet enchantress of the dell!
THOU wilt not sing, until the stars arise:
And then, like her, for ever wilt thou dwell
On themes to make Pity weep out her eyes!
Sure thou wert once a Nightingale! &mdash; And when
Thou leav'st this world, thou shalt be one again!
