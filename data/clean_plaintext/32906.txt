Nor Ladies wanton love, nor wandring knight,
Legend I out in rymes all richly dight.
Nor fright the Reader with the Pagan vaunt
Of mightie Mahoud, and great Termagaunt.
Nor list I Sonnet of my Mistresse face,
To paint some Blowesse with a borrowed grace.
Nor can I bide to pen some hungry Scene
For thick-skin eares, and undiscerning eyen.
Nor ever could my scornfull Muse abide
With Tragick shooes her ankles for to hide.
Nor can I crouch, and writhe my fauning tayle
To some great Patron, for my best avayle.
Such hunger-starven, Trencher-Poetry,
Or let it never live, or timely dye:
Nor under every bank and every Tree,
Speake rymes unto my oten Minstralsie:
Nor caroll out so pleasing lively laies,
As mought the Graces move my mirth to praise.
Trumpet, and reeds, and socks, and buskins fine,
I them bequeath:  whose statues wandring Twine
Of Yvy, mixt with Bayes, circlen around
Their living Temples likewise Laurell-bound.
Rather had I, albee in carelesse rymes,
Check the mis-ordred world, and lawelesse Tymes.
Nor need I crave the Muses mid-wifry,
To bring to light so worth-lesse Poetry:
Or if we list, what baser Muse can bide,
To sit and sing by Grantaes naked side.
They haunt the tyded Thames and salt Medway,
Ere since the fame of their late Bridall day.
Nought have we here but willow-shaded shore,
To tell our Grant his banks are left forlore.
