With smiles unveiling her propitious face,
To see the sorc'ress Night with limping step
Roll down the sleepy hill,
Morning ascends her car:
Roses, that image Eden's happy bow'rs,
Adorn her head; wide waves her mantle blue;
Her eye darts fire; and gems
She drops on ev'ry thorn.
The loveliest lustre of the starry spheres,
Fore-ran her progress; and admonish'd mild,
Sweet Philomel her plaints
'Till eve's return to cease.
Alert she chears the clos'd and drooping flow'rs,
With words of mystic sense, and whisper'd sweet&mdash;
"O, virgins!  do not weep;
The sun shall be your spouse:
With glowing fondness on your foliage play,
And make your beauty lovelier; sweeter far
Shall sweetness seem, exhal'd
By his soft chemic beam:"
But, virgin mild!  what mead, or tree, or fountain,
Wakes not to rapture at thy dove-like presence?
For thee sheep bleat on hills,
The rocks resound with song.
Forth from thy gates advance the smiling hours,
While jocund Hope, heav'n-featur'd, leads their band,
Congenial with his pulse
Youth hails thy pleasing prime.
The hermit wont in lonely caves to dwell,
Starts from his couch at thy soul-cheering ray,
His orisons ascend
For everlasting morn.
Fair type of all we wish beyond the sky!
Bright without rage, harmonious without art,
Kind renovating source,
Of Nature's strength and wealth!
Thee let me frequent carol in the dale,
When hawthorns bloom, and scented violets rise
Nor then forget to sing
The cowslip, loving morn.
Narcissus on the reedy winding brook
Pining, with yellow jealousy beholds
Thy peerless vivid blush
Reflected in the stream.
With villain-screening night let Vice retire!
Still at thy chaste approach our hands, our hearts,
Shall offer incense meet
At thy unblemish'd shrine.
