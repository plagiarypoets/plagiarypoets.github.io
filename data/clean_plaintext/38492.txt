Attend all ye nymphs and swains of the green,
For you I have rov'd the plains round,
Whole month's I've been prying, and now I have seen,
Where smiling Content's to be found.
Come quickly with me, and I'll show you the way,
To the spot where he chose his retreat;
You must fly from these plains to be easy and gay,
And near him must take up your seat.

I sought him 'mongst crouds, and in each gaudy place,
But those were the Mansions of Care;
In the Palace of Greatness unknown was his face,
Contentment had never been there.
I hied me to roofs that invited to joys,
Hope tempted me thither to rove;
But rude was their wit, and their pleasure was noise,
Tho' they beckon'd to Peace and to Love.

At last, near a brook, to a cottage I stray'd,
With a few simple sheep on the green;
The rose and the woodbine their sweetness display'd,
Not Plenty but Health bless'd the scene.
Good-Nature appear'd, and unhatch'd me the door,
Nor knew what my coming there meant;
How great my surprize!  here my search was all o'er,
For he told me his name was Content.
