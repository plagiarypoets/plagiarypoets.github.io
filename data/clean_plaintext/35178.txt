In rich refulgence rob'd, the year
Again revolves his swelling sphere,
Profusive pours bright beams around
On high-wrought WINDSOR'S holy ground.
Not now Time's wizard eyes behold
A cluster'd range of Barons bold,
Not now, 'mongst steeds, the buckler'd ray
Darts, as of yore, nocturnal day,
When EDWARD to the tourney led
The Knights that rival EUROPE bred
Yet still beneath the fretted roof,
Where war-worn banners wave aloof,
In gorgeous garb fair dames aspire,
Spread with light sweep their tissued trains,
Shoot from soft orbs attractive fire,
And lure to love the peopled plains.
The steel-clad champion's pond'rous plume,
The sword's gigantic stroke is o'er,
Yet nobler now is ALBION's alter'd doom,
To lift the loyal lay, and BRUNSWICK'S STAR ADORE.

Vast are the themes of BRITAIN'S boast,
Immortal ALFRED rul'd her coast,
For RUFUS' fall a Nation's tear
Deplor'd the miscreant's erring spear.
Sublime was valiant HENRY's fate,
Sublime ELIZA's sumptuous state,
Nor long did RICHARD's boar-like rage
Defile his country's pictur'd page.
The two CONTENDING ROSES shoot,
With stronger hold their mingled root.
But not alone for elder days,
Shall flow the tide of regal praise.
Our bounteous GEORGE from ills remov'd,
Has quench'd the flame which burnt the land,
By richer rectitude belov'd,
He gives, with willing force, command.
The subject race who wail'd their stroke,
When ENGLAND's Sun awhile was set,
Again find glory in their silken yoke,
Nor tell of TUDOR's line nor proud PLANTAGENET.

GAUL, of her sceptred honour shorn,
Her lacerated lilies torn,
Vainly lifts up her wav'ring eye,
To all-delusive LIBERTY.
She tears her KING's best rights away,
And madly plants her CIVIC BAY;
Each cloister'd nook she next explores,
And gives to DEMAGOGUES her shores.
Her LETTER'D SOURCE with poison teems,
Rul'd by each RUFFIAN'S MYSTIC DREAMS;
Not thus, our Isle's exalted hour,
Calls forth the Poet's plausive pow'r,
To hail a PATRIOT MONARCH'S part,
Who opes his virtuous pattern wide,
And show'rs down wealth, and bliss, and art,
And glories in the public pride.
His thunders shake the Eastern world,
Till INDUS bow the baffled head,
O'er AUSTRIA'S grasping realms his rage is hurl'd,
And RUSSIA hears the sound, and shudd'ring shrinks with dread.

Swift rising from his pearly cave,
OLD OCEAN cleaves the briny wave,
His brows by coral wreaths comprest,
While sedgy honours load his breast.
Raptur'd he views this conqu'ring plain,
And yields the fasces of the main.
How chang'd!  since erst the LATIN LORD,
Defac'd the DRUID'S hallow'd hoard,
And taught their scythed cars to fly,
Scar'd at his eagle's burning eye.
For now in ev'ry dale divine,
Where riot nature and the Nine,
From heart-felt joy the Peasant pours,
Without one sad enquiring groan,
The voted portion of his stores,
Glad that the lesser share's his own.
Pleas'd with their lot, in fond surprize,
The rustic Bands exulting sing,
Confess the wisdom of TRADUC'D EXCISE,
And swell with CHARLOTTE'S worth, THE TRIUMPH OF THEIR KING.
