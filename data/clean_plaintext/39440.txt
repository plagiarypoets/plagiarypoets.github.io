Your Shepherd, dear Phillis, invites to be gay,
To range thro' the meadows and fields;
To cull the sweet flow'rets that blossom in May,
And taste all the pleasures it yields.

The daisy, the primrose, and violet too,
Their charms in profusion disclose;
And soon in succession, delighted, you'll view
The blush of the opening rose.

How sweet sing the sky-larks, saluting the day,
When straining their musical throats!
And blackbirds and linnets soon join on each spray,
To warble their various notes.

Near my cottage this harmony frequently reigns
(Oh sure, 'tis delightful to tell!)
What life can compare with a life on the plains,
Where peace and tranquility dwell!

Each eve, to enliven the innocent scene,
The nymphs and the shepherds advance;
And lads with their lasses all meet on the green,
To join in the rustical dance.

Then come, my dear Phillis, enjoy this retreat,
Come share these engaging delights;
Nor envy the proud, the ambitious, or great:&mdash;
Your shepherd it is that invites.
