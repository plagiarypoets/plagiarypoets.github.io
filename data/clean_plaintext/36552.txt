Let titl'd guilt and overweening pride,
Call forth the brass, the marble, and the steel,
And lying bard, with pompous phrase to hide
That baseness time is panting to reveal!
But what avails it?  Public fame may reel,
A moment giddy with the flattering tale,
Which as it flows suspicion shall congeal
Till, with the dup'd expectant's hope, it fail,
And o'er the hated name rank rottenness prevail!

Not such is, ROBERT RUSSELL, worth like thine,
Which unambitious shunn'd its own display,
Though bright content with mellow'd beams to shine
Along the track of life's laborious way.
With tears we hang this tributary lay
Upon thy urn our full hearts to relieve,
While hope reposes on the destin'd day,
When truth's fair hand th' immortal wreath shall weave,
Which God himself shall give, the good alone receive
