Whene'er the cruel Hand of Death
Untimely stops a fav'rite's Breath,
Muses in plaintive Numbers tell
How lov'd he liv'd &mdash; how mourn'd he fell.&mdash;
Catullus 'wail'd his Sparrow's Fate,
And Gray immoraliz'd his Cat.
Thrice tuneful Bards!  could I but chime so clever,
My Quart, my honest Quart, should live for ever.

How weak is all a Mortal's pow'r
T' avert the Death-devoted Hour!
Nor can a Shape or Beauty save
From the sure Conquest of the Grave.
In vain the Butler's choicest Care,
The Master's Wish, the Burser's Pray'r!
For when Life's lengthen'd to its longest Span,
China itself must fall, as well as Man.

Can I forget how oft my Quart
Has sooth'd my Care, and warm'd my Heart?
When Barley lent its balmy Aid,
And all its liquid Charms display'd!
When Orange and the Nut-brown Toast
Swan mantling round the spicey Coast!
The pleasing Depth I view'd with sparkling Eyes,
Nor envy'd Jove the nectar of the Skies.

The Side-board, on that fatal Day,
When you in glitt'ring Ruins lay,
Mourn'd at thy Loss. &mdash; In guggling Tone
Decanters poured out their Moan&mdash;
A Dimness hung on ev'ry Glass&mdash;
Joe wonder'd what the Matter was.&mdash;
Corks self-contracted free'd the frantic Beer,
And sympathizing Tankards dropt a Tear.

Where are the flow'ry Wreaths that bound
In rosy Rings thy Chaplets round?
The azure stars whose glitt'ring rays
Promis'd a happier Length of Days!
The Trees that on thy Border grew,
And blossom'd with eternal Blue!
Trees, Stars, and Flow'rs are scatter'd on the Floor,
And all thy brittle Beauties are no more.

Hadst thou been form'd of coarser Earth,
Had Nottingham but giv'n thee Birth!
Or had the variegated Side
Of Stafford's sable Hue been dy'd,
The stately Fabric had been found,
Tho' Tables tumbl'd on the Ground.&mdash;
The finest Mould the soonest will decay:
Hear this, ye Fair, for you yourselves are Clay!
