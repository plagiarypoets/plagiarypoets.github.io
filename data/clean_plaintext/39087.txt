Heap, heap the shrine!  'tis Gray's, &mdash; the Muse's flame,
Shall light the incense with immortal fire,
When luxury and pride, without a name,
Amid the wreck of nature shall expire.&mdash;

Grated to nothing! &mdash; where is ancient Troy?
The Grecian states, and proud insulting Rome,
(Where human mis'ry was source of joy),
The Muse alone has rescued from the tomb.

Her harp she rears, &mdash; while her delighted eye,
Hangs o'er the Elegy that sings of death,
Fated to live, when empires shall decay,
The boast of Time, and hallow'd by his breath.

The hand that sweeps the soul inspiring string,
No more may aim to chain th' enchanted ear,
But the rapt spirit soars, on eager wing,
While hope and faith propel th' exulting tear.

Exist there beings that have never felt,
With souls abashed, the suppliant's contrite sigh?
Here let them pause, &mdash; ('twas here a suppliant knelt)
And rear with humble gaze th' imploring eye,

To dumb forgetfulness the soul a prey,
Awaits not the inevitable hour,&mdash;
Perhaps another dawn shall bring the day,
To leave repentance past the sinner's power.

Now! &mdash; solemn be the stillness!  rais'd the eye;
'Tis extacy attunes her sacre lyre;
The anthem's peal shall reach where all is joy,
Then chant thy vows of truth with lips of fire.

Learn, too, that charity does still prepare
Full many mansions 'bove th' eternal skies,
And those who give for love of mercy here,
Shall read their welcome in seraphic eyes.

The prison's doors were closed, but there you came;
The orphan's and the widow's plaint you heard;
For love of ME you gave, and in my name,
Ask mercy, &mdash; Heaven is the sure reward.

To poverty, &mdash; to error, &mdash; and to pain,
Have the now tremb'ling suppliants mercy shewn,
To such my Father shall his pardon deign,
SUCH ARE THE ANGELS that SURROUND his Throne.
