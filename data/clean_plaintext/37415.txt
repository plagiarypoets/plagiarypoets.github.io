Recovery!  daughter of Creation too,
Tho' not for immortality design'd,
The Lord of life and death
Sent thee from heaven to me:
Had not I heard thy gentle tread approach,
Not heard the whisper of thy welcome voice,
Death had with iron foot
My chilly forehead prest.
'Tis true, I then had wander'd where the earths
Roll around suns, had stray'd along the path
Where the man'd comet soars
Beyond the armed eye;
And with the rapturous eager greet had hail'd
The inmates of these earths and of those suns;
Had hail'd the countless host
That dwell the comet's disk;
Had ask'd the novice questions, and obtain'd
Such answers as a sage vouchsafes to youth;
Had learn'd in hours far more
Than ages here unfold!
But I had then not ended here below,
What, in the enterprising bloom of life,
Fate with no light behest
Requir'd me to begin.
Recovery!  daughter of Creation too,
Tho' not for immortality design'd,
The Lord of life and death
Sent thee from heaven to me.
