Thou, for whose brow the Muse hath deign'd to twine
A wreath, not flaunting, tho' the spell-wrought bowl
That Spenser warm'd, and Milton's magic soul
Hath charm'd thy flight &mdash; whose imag'ry is thine,
Strong in disdain of those whose phlegm surveys,
As far too glaring such luxuriance bright;&mdash;
The vein that sparkles thro' thy native lays,
Refulgent hence may 'lume thy pen'ry's night:
Haply a Sydney's or a Somers' care
Collect thy sweetness for each genial mind,
Now lonely wasting on the desert air!
Is modish Taste to Nature's beauties blind?
Tho' the trim gardens smoother liveries wear,
Her verdure lives, when they're on earth reclin'd.
