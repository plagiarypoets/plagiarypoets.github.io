There's something sweet in sitting thus alone,
Thinking of hearts, alas!  which beat  no more&mdash;
'Till fancy peopleth with their voice the moan
The night-breeze makes, as with the poplar hoar
It passing struggles: &mdash; on the pebbly shore
Seated at night, when winds and waves were still,
I've thus thus the dark stream, whispering evermore
While lapsing to the ocean, heard &mdash; at will
Would I could wake such strains as now my spirit fill!

I listen to the wind &mdash; it speaks of days
Of youthful study and of youthful bliss,
When the wild, deep, deep-rooted thirst of praise
Was wakened first on such a night as this&mdash;
When wandering forth from sports I well could miss,
I saw the bright round moon in purest sky,
Listening the sea's blue wavelets curling kiss
The silver shore, which to my raptured eye
Stretched glittering far and wide in heaven's bright panoply.

Gods!  there is inspiration in the night!
Unknown, uncherished in the busy hour,
When all things walk abroad by common light,
And bound upon the turf, or crop the flower
Of day; now purer thoughts exert their power
With simple, perfect, undistracted sway:
Night stilleth those rude cares that would devour
Our soft serenity, and drives away
Those useless sluggish drones, who waste our hours by day.

Now muster round the awful shades of those
I might have loved, alive &mdash; and worship, dead;
And each great spirit, as it flitting goes
Back to the world of night, a thrilling dread,
Severely pleasing, leaves:  I bow my head
To all and each of this immortal throng;
Hoping &mdash; vain thought! &mdash; that when my earthly bed
Receives me, then this mighty train among
I too may walk, a sprite immortalized by song!
