O faire Charites, Joves most deere delight, 
O lend me now one heaven-inchanting lay, 
And you rare Nimphes which please Apollos sight, 
Bring spreading Palme and never-dying Bay, 
With Olive branches strew the pleasant way: 
And with your Viols sound one pleasing straine, 
To ayde his Muse, and raise his humble vaine.

And thou O Beta, Soveraigne of his thought, 
Englands Diana, let him thinke on thee, 
By thy perfections let his Muse be taught, 
And in his breast so deepe imprinted be, 
That he may write of sacred Chastitie: 
Though not like Collin in thy Britomart, 
Yet loves as much, although he wants his arte.

O my dread Soveraigne, rare and princely Mayd, 
From whose pure eyes the world derives her light, 
In Angels robes with majestie arayd, 
In whom true vertue is defin'd aright: 
O let these lines be gracious in thy sight, 
In whom alone, as in a perfect glas, 
All may discerne how chast Matilda was....
