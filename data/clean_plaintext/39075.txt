Say, lovely Cynthia, why thy beam benign
Allays the painful heavings of the breast?
Say whence its pleasing influence over mine,
To sooth the anguish of my heart to rest?
O freely shed thy mild mellifluence here,
I would no other smile to wipe the bitter tear.

Luna, my hopes (thy natal hours) more slow,
I long to greet thy lucid orb again;
Thy nonage fled, I hail thy halcyon glow,
And wish, sweet plausive orb, thou'dst never wane:
Then mem'ry urges not the cruel smart,
But heavenly rapture calms and sooths my breaking heart.

When in the sylvan vista I recline,
And note thy progress through the bending trees,
I start, sweet goddess, for I oft opine
I hear thy voice symphonious in the breeze;
Again I turn; ah, Cynthia were it you;
I turn again, unconscious of the dew!

Oh!  as thy lucid phase I nightly woo,
Fly sorrow's theme &mdash; the dark despairing thought,
Sweet sadness' eye-drop clouds my wishful view,
For well I muse thy beams are pity-fraught;
Then, Cynthia, shed thy mild mellifluence here,
And check the rising sigh, and wipe the bitter tear.
