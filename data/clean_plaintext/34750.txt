This prince of poets, who before us went,
Had a vast income, and profusely spent:
Some have his lands, but none his treasur'd store,
Lands un-manur'd by us, and mortgaged o'er and o'er!
"About his wreaths the vulgar muses strive,
And with a touch their wither'd bays revive!"
They kiss his tomb, and are enthusiasts made;
So Statius slept, inspir'd by Virgil's shade.
To Spencer much, to Milton much is due;
But in great Dryden we preserve the two.
What Muse but his can Nature's beauties hit,
Or catch that airy fugitive, call'd wit?
