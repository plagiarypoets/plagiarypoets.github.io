I sing of the days that are gone,
Of Werter who now is no more;
Unhappy the hour I was born,
His loss I shall ever deplore.
The grass that waves high round his tomb,
Marks how subject man is to decay;
The Monarch must e'en meet his doom:
When death calls, ev'n he must obey.

Since life is uncertain on earth,
Ah!  why should I sorrow in vain;
The same Pow'r who gave us our birth,
Has a right to recall it again.
The virtues that dwelt in his breast,
Sweet remembrance will ever hold dear;
The honour my Werter possess'd,
Demands, in soft pity, a tear.

Oh, could it the Angel restore,
Like a fountain it ever should flow;
But my Werter, alas!  is no more,
And my heart is o'erwhelmed with woe.
O give me but strength to retain
That goodness that dwelt in his heart;
When life shall no longer remain,
We shall meet again, never to part.
