Blithsome Goddess!  sprightly youth,
Source of innocence and truth,
Fairest virtues form thy train,
Choicest blessings crown thy reign;
As thy opening charms advance,
See them all around thee dance;
See them all around thee bow,
Weaving garlands for thy brow:
Health presents her ruddy face,
Vigour offers active grace;
Mirth bestows her harmless wiles,
Sportive frolicks, chearful smiles.
Beauty from her genuine springs,
In thy lap her treasure flings:
These combine to deck thy mien,
And on thy placid front are seen.
Nature brings her purest fires,
Love that glows with chaste desires;
Friendship undebas'd by Art,
Candour's unsuspicious heart;
Valour's generous ardent flame,
Burning with the thirst of fame;
These, in simple colours dress'd,
Grace the mirrour of thy breast;
Genius gives the tuneful quire,
Thine the harp and thine the lyre;
Thine the Poet's glowing themes,
Thine are Fancy's purest dreams;
Thine are Musick's softest powers;
Thine are Life's harmonious hours;
Thine the jocund spirits gay,
Dancing suns that round thee play;
Hope that every wish supplies;
Thoughtless ease that care desires;
Virtues, pleasures, half divine,
These, enchanting Youth!  are thine.
