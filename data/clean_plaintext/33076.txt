Having no other gift right noble dame
To testifie my mynde this booke I send
The autour when he liv'd did beare you name
And for to honour ladies this he penned
Here may you reade in sugred verse set out
The praises of Belphebe worthie Quene
And faery landes adventures all about
With other exploites worthie to be seene
Here Georges holines may us direct
To conquer all the monstrous shapes of sin
And Guions temperance make us suspect
The sugred baites of pleasures wanton ginnes
Deign it to reade and reape such fruites it beares
I still will wishe you long and happie yeares
