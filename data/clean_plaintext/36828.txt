Ah!  wretched victim at seduction's shrine,
Who would believe thou once wert fresh and gay?
Poor faded remnant of a form divine,
Thou once wert beauteous as the rising day:
Thy heart could once on wings of rapture rise,
Thy reputation was without a spot,
Pleasure would sparkle in thy beaming eyes,
No mortal e'er could boast a happier lot:
But thou art now, alas!  by all mankind forgot.

I have beheld thee beautiful and young,
As bright and pure as the unsullied snow
That to the mountain-top still fondly clung,
Tho' spring had dawn'd upon the vales below.
Thy step was that of nimbly bounding roe;
And, tho' thy soul was not restrain'd by art,
And all thou did'st irregular and wild,
Thou then possess'dst an uncorrupted heart,
Each action and each thought proclaim'd thee nature's child.

But now, alas!  how hard it were to trace,
Beneath that pale and wasted form of thine,
One remnant of that loveliness and grace,
Which ev'n a cynic would have called divine.
Deep thought has dimm'd that bright and sparkling eye,
Whose glance could once give keenest extasy;
Thy cheek, where once the bloom which health bestows,
Might well have rivall'd summer's fairest rose,
Is pale as if thou'dst sunk in death's long calm repose.

But time will come when he who ruin'd thee,
Shall feel the scorpion in his tortur'd breast;
Then thou shall be repaid for misery,
Thy grievous wrongs shall amply be redress'd,
And thy now shatter'd bark shall safely ride
In that far-distant long-desired heaven,
Where no rude storms disturb the peaceful tide,
And where to gentle souls like thine is given
To know the unfading joys that are but known in Heav'n.
