Thou!  whom of yore upon their naval prow
Themistocles and Cimon saw confest,
When Greece made haughty Persia bow,
In sky-bright robes of waving azure drest!
Whose voice exulting o'er the maid,
Red with the blood of thousands slain,
Shouted aloud, "thus ever shall the race
Of freedom triumph, when with patriot might
They rush indignant to the fight,
Resolved with fame to live, or glorious death embrace."

Ethereal Victory!  Jove's darling child,
Twin-born with Pallas, when the daring maid
Urged on with rout, and terror wild,
(The massy spear high-brandish'd o'er her head)
That impious crew, whose giant pride
All heaven's authentic powers defied:
When radiant from successful war,
He bade thee sit near his immortal throne,
Around thee braced a golden zone,
And wreathed thy head with beams pluck'd from the morning star.

Ethereal Victory!  Oh!  Heed my prayer!
By all thy ancient trophies won,
By all thy favourite Britain hath achieved,
By the deep wounds, which every warrior son
Of her's, with extasy hath e'er received,
When liberty and justice strove
To fire heroic souls with ardent love,
By thy own dauntless mind, O goddess swear,
Swear, that "from Calpe to each distant Pole,
Where'er the glittering billows roll,
Britannia's progeny shall still survey
Thy guardian form, thy out-stretch'd arm,
Forceful the raging winds to charm,
Scatter opposing hosts, and subjugate the sea."
She swore the mighty oath; to Howe was given
To teach, while thunders fierce he hurl'd,
The astonish'd Gaul, the listening world,
The oath by Victory sworn, and ratified by heaven.
