Hail!  ye bright waves, that fair Cytherea lave,
From whence, in pomp of youth and loveliness,
With fragrant roses crown'd,
Thou, heavenly goddess, rose;

Thine hallow'd birth, in strains melodious,
Tritons, on argent pinions, hov'ring sung,
Smooth as the lay which floats
From lone Pierian shades;

When, high enthron'd upon the eternal skies,
Night's gentle regent her effulgence pales,
While 'neath embow'ring groves,
Thy tender vot'ries roam.

By thee encharm'd, the rash adventurous youth,
With martial ardor, flies to fields where Fame,
'Mid shadowing trophies, speeds
Her blood-fraught dire career,

Yet not for thee, oh Fame!  his bosom burns,
Nor for the garland honors of thy brow,
Nor all the gay parade
Thy favour'd followers prize:

But love, delightful love, invites him on,&mdash;
A softer flame his throbbing heart pervades;
And thine extatic smile,
A war's fatigue repays;

The simple carle, who from his plains ne'er stray'd,
Oft' times reclines beside the brawling brook,
And in the silent hour
Hymns his desires to thee.

While Hesper laves in dew his pearly light,
And musk, borne on wings of gossamer,
In sweet impassion'd notes,
Entrance his list'ning ear;

Oh bliss supreme's his lot with her to dwell,
Whose virtuous mind, whose unaffected grace,
Adorns life's checquer'd scenes,
And turns its tears to smiles.

Enchanting power!  oh grant my early song,
Thy warbling voice, thy softly thrilling sway,
To win the nymph I love,
Thy liquid numbers give.

And when the morn, from amaranthine couch,
O'er the horizon sheds her vermeil light,
Again the Muse shall raise
Her orisons to thee.
