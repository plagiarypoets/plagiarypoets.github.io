To grace his goodly Queen, Tames presently proclaims,
That all the Kentish Floods, resigning him their names,
Should presently repaire unto his mighty Hall,
And by the posting Tides, towards London sends to call
Cleere Ravensburne (though small, remembred them among)
At Detford entring.  Whence as down she comes along,
She Darent thither warnes:  who calles her sister Cray,
Which hasten to the Court with all the speed they may.
And but that Medway then of Tames obtain'd such grace,
Except her country Nymphes, that none should be in place,
More Rivers from each part, had instantly been there,
Then at their Marriage, first, by Spenser numbered were.
