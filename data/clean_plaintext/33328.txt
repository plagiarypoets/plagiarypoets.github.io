Thou art not hatch'd, forth from anothers braine,
Nor yet Collect'd, from others toiles thy sight,
The selfe-same Man, that bred Thee beares the paine
Of thy long birth:  O weary wandring Wight!
It's carefull he, by Knowledge gives thee light,
And deepe experience to adorne thy name;
Both Pilgrime, Pen-man, so thy Maister right
Who best can judge, in what concernes the same:
Then free-borne toile, flee forth with winged Fame
Thy Countries Virgin, thou the first penn'd Booke
That in his Soile, did ever Pilgrime frame
Of curious Travailes; whereon the Learned looke:
Then Knit thy Maiden brow, with Garlands greene,
The first of times, the last this Age hath Seene.
