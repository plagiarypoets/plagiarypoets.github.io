Yes, Shepherds!  swell the strain, and weave the dance
In cheerful circles down your echoing vales&mdash;
Then, bounding like the Alpine deer, advance
With streamers gaily deck'd with pictur'd tales;
Ye maidens, poising well your rich hung pails,
Mothers, with infants smiling like the morn,
All, all advance &mdash; an airy herald sails
With the swift tidings that a Prince is born&mdash;
Shout the last shout of joy, and to your shades return.

Yes, shout! &mdash; that peal of gladness is your last!
Wave high your trophies, and your off'rings spread!
Now be ye dumb!  and on the ocean cast
Your heart's oblation &mdash; for your Prince is dead!
Dead e'er he lived!  for by his mother's bed,
Mocking the nurse's care, the leech's skill,
Stood iron-hearted fate, and scowling fled
With his scarce kindled spirit &mdash; "Just heaven, thy will,"
The lovely mother sigh'd, "be done!  poor heart, lie still."
