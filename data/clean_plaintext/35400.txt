Another time, when, from your evening meal
You dream that home returning, by the way
Where an old mansion totters in decay,
As fearfully along the gloom you steal,
At once a little window shutter rings,
And looking, out a nose of giant springs
Long as your arm!  where'er you strive to fly,
Before, behind, strange phantoms fix your eye,
Loll out a length of tongue, and dart their fiery stings.
