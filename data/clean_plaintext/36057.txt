Ye winding aisles, ye groves with darkness crowned,
Ye grots where CHARLOTTE studiously reclined,
Charmed with the varied scenes that shone around,
Esher's tall groves, and Windsor's gloom behind,
No more her learned and accomplished mind
Shall dignify your elegant retreats!
No more your fragrant garlands hang entwined
O'er Claremont's rural and romantic seats!
For she is dead &mdash; her heart no longer beats
With warm attachments and affections strong;
No more her tongue to LEOPOLD repeats
The summer beauties of her THOMSON'S song:
Mute is that voice which every ear inspired,
And cold that breast which every eye admired!
