Hail, happy sheep!  for in our plains ye feed
Secure from every care that us molests;
Ye shed no bitter tears,
Nor pine with hopeless love;
But in your hearts Love follows Nature's law,
Without his tortures, ye partake his sweets;
Nor do ye ever rue
Fallen Ambition's aim;
Honor for you hath no attractive charms,
Nor selfish interest, nor sly deceit:
But all these ills, and more,
Betide man's wicked race.
Yet man possesses reason that ye want!
Meek innocents!  here, trust me, loss is gain:
For from it small relief
To mortals is deriv'd.
No.  This fam'd reason, when the passions rage,
But ill defends us:  wine disturbs her rest:
And oft the traitress wounds
The heart that sought her aid.
Severe, yet impotent, against her foes
A fragile shield she raises, insecure;
But ye have faithful dogs
Against the rage of wolves;
And better from these savages thy guard,
Than from our senses reason.  Lives, like yours,
Of sweet forgetfulness,
With indolence and ease,
Surpass in comforts all the pride of wealth,
With birth, and taste, and elegance of form.
For oh!  these shadows yield
To your substantial bliss!
Incessantly they urge us to do wrong,
And sad reflection, in the midst of mirth,
Dashes the festive cup
With gall of dire remorse.
The gods of this world man would make eternal.
Dull, stupid fool!  Our pleasures, like ourselves,
Pass as a summer's breeze,
Nor leave a trace behind.
No sublunary beings suffer more
Th' inconstancy of Fortune; she decides
In every stage of life
With unresisted sway.
Feed on then, gentle sheep, without restraint:
Blest in your ignorance, and happier far
Than us, who madly boast
The epithet of wise.
