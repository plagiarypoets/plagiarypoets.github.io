Thin and worn out!  alas, my poor old Shoes!
My old companions!  fellow-travellers
In many an up-hill, down-hill, dirty road!
Gone past all patching!  gone beyond the reach
Of cobler, shoe apothecary's skill,
Or graduate master of the gentle craft.
State quacks or patent pills as soon might save
A rotten constitution.  There ye lie,
Divorc'd, alas!  for ever from the feet,
That late ye fitted well!  Mute monitors&mdash;
Texts to a mournful sermon &mdash; there ye lie,
The victims of that universal lot
All things must one day share &mdash; kingdoms and thrones,
And pyramids, yea, haply, earth herself,
Like all her offspring for destruction fram'd.
True that, regardless of all shape and size,
In utter absolute contempt of toes,
Tap'ring to narrow point, pyramidal,
Your maker fram'd you; tort'ring grievously
The fingers of the feet, that lay comprest,
Crowded, and crushing close as a human cargo,
Bound for the Sugar Isles; and kibes and corns
Ensued.  Yet soon accustom'd, lay they pack'd,
And prest, insensible, so true it is
Custom is second nature.

But it seems
The weathercock of fashion has veer'd round,
And theoretical Shoemakers preach
New doctrines &mdash; that the principle of Shoes,
Mistaken, or perverted, many an age,
Now first are understood; so right and left,
Forsooth, they fit them to the nat'ral shape&mdash;
Gradual reformers!

Must I try their plans?
Submit to innovation, and renounce
Old custom, for new theories?  And yet
Something must needs be done.  It boots not now
To piece and patch; no botching profits aught;
The old supports are gone; the stamina
Worn out; the sole destroyed!
