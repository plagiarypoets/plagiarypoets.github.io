In olden times, in chivalry's fair law
The youth were trained, that sought renowned name,
Were taught the lance to wield, the sword to draw,
The spear and shield to toss in warlike game,
And in their hearts, to cherish love's bright flame,
In wild adventure they spent every hour,
And grace and honor sought, where'er they came,
Whether in festal hall, or ladies' bower,
Or battering at the gates of some enchanted tower.

But now-a-day Romance is banished,
And those gay fairy forms that shone so bright,
Fair Love, clear Honour, all have vanished,
Friendship, firm Truth, and bold defence of right;&mdash;
Our best, our brightest hopes are quenched in night!
The cold world scornful glances at us darts,
For in the world's joys we may not delight,
We do not love the merchant's crowded marts,
Nor to seek fame and gain by dull forensic arts.

Yet we must trim our vessel to the tide,
And steer our courses as the currents flow,
By the prevailing winds our bark must guide,
And catch the breezes as they chance to blow;
And through the world by the world's rules must go.
But though we yield us to the stern demand,
A very worldly wight, in outward show,
Still, in our hearts, Romance shall make a stand,
And in our secret soul, shall spring a "fairy hand."
