Far in a deep sequester'd glade,
By fairy hands enchanting made,
Their favour'd child, young Spencer, lov'd to stray;
The while the sportive forms would tread
With light step round his infant head,
And fill with dreams divine the future lay.

Strange were the visions, strange and fair!
And changeful as the varying air,
When Summer's sun contends with Winter's snow;
And now the scene was overcast,
Danger and fear were in the blast;
And now 'twas lovely light's seraphic glow.

That darken'd scene in terror told,
Of noble knights, and Pagans bold,
Of battles dire, and virtue's deep distress;
Of sages deep in magic read,
Whose potent spells awoke the dead,
That lovely light was Heavenly Holiness.

On either side a hallow'd pair,
Friendship and Temperance were there;
Fairest of all a vestal pageant rose,
Of Chastity by Vice essay'd,
And still triumphant, though betray'd,
For Heaven was there, and scatter'd all its foes.

Now came the day, the dreams were gone,
Which all the night so lovely shone,
And wav'd their wings around the sleeping child,
But deep within his infant breast,
The fleeting visions left imprest
Their high romantic forms, and features wild.
