"Hail, INDOLENCE," meek power, whose placid birth
Was celebrated in the sacred East,
By the hoar BRAMIN'S flame,
Fann'd by thy MOTHER'S breath.

Thee, the proud LORD of DAY'S creative heat,
As he in fainting rapture on the breast
Of the WEST WIND reclin'd,
Gave to the early World:

The whiles around thy cradle spicy gales
Breath'd aromatic odours, and refresh'd
Thy infant sense; delight
Beyond the hope of toil.

Benign Restorer of the World, though there
Thy dearest haunts remain'd, and gentle EASE,
Thy sister, spread her arms,
For thy perpetual couch:

Yet mindful of mankind, thy darling care,
Stole to the shiv'ring native of the NORTH,
And lull'd him to the roar
Of the rude Winter's song.

NECESSITY, thy foe, stood charm'd awhile,
Nor so imperiously his daily task
Enjoin'd incessant, but
Permitted his repose.

Soon GENIUS cheer'd his darkness with her lamp,
And SCIENCE with far-reaching arms, procur'd
His comforts from the waste,
That frown'd on him before.

'Twas INDOLENCE inspir'd the Muses gifts;
And bade their wild notes murmur from his cave,
In song thus haply free,
Unfetter'd ev'n by rhyme.
