When arts and arms, beneath ELIZA's smile,
Spred wide their influence o'er this happy isle;
A golden reign, uncurs'd with party-rage,
That foe to taste, and tyrant of our age;
Ere all our learning in a libel lay,
And all our talk, in politics, or play:
The stateman oft would soothe his toils with wit,
What SPENCER  sung, and nature's SHAKESPEAR writ;
Or to the laurel'd grove, at times, retire,
There, woo the Muse, and wake the moving lyre.

As fair examples, like ascending morn,
The world at once enlighten and adorn;
From them diffus'd, the gentle arts of peace
Shot brightning o'er the land, and swift encrease:
Rough nature soften'd into grace and ease;
Sense grew polite, and science sought to please.

Reliev'd from yon rude Scene of party-din,
Where open baseness vys with secret sin,
And safe embower'd in WOBURN'S airy groves,
Let us recall the times our taste approves;
Awaken to our aid the mourning Muse;
Thro every bosom tender thought infuse;
Melt angry faction into moral sense,
And to his guests a BEDFORD'S soul dispense.

And now, while Spring extends her smiling reign,
Green on the mountain, flowery in the plain;
While genial Nature breathes, from hill and dale,
Health, fragrance, gladness, in the living gale;
The various softness, stealing thro the heart,
Impressions, sweetly social, will impart.

When sad EUDOCIA pours her hopeless woe,
The tear of pity will unbidden flow!
When erring PHOCYAS, whom wild passions blind,
Holds up himself, a mirror for mankind;
An equal eye on our own hearts we turn,
Where frailties lurk, where fond affections burn:
And conscious, Nature is all the same,
We mourn the guilty, while the guilt we blame!
