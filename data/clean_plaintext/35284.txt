She ev'ry flower had gather'd, and dispos'd
In cabinet secure her posied sweets,
The weed rejecting ever.  Witness these
So neatly penn'd, so carefully preserv'd,
Volumes of beauty, for the leisure[d] eye
And faithless memory copied. . . .

Chiefly thine,
Thou bard of nature, Shakespeare.  Milton thine,
Thine, Dryden, from a mound of rubbish cull'd,
Yet not inferior to the best that blow.
Thine Spenser, to the antiquarian eye
Soberly pleasing.  Butler, thine, replete
With learning, sense, and wit.  Roscommon, thine,
Judicious, elegant; and, Otway, thine,
Applauded and reprov'd.  Thine, Pope, as gems
Not seldom lustrous, sometimes tinsel-ray'd.
Thine, gentle Pomfret, not to be despis'd;
And, nebulous Blackmore, thine.  Thine, charming Rowe,
Politest grace of the dramatic page;
And thine, poetic Prior.  Parnel, thine,
To me of lovely fragrance.  Thomson, thine;
And thine, more musical, descriptive less,
Young, in whose tedious and protracted song
Still gleams and still expires the cloudy day
Of genuine poetry.  Thine too are there,
Impetuous Akenside, as thunder strong.
Thine, awful, pleasing, persecuted Gray.
Thine, lovelorn Littleton; and Shenstone, thine,
An artificial nosegay made of shells.
And thine, not least esteem'd, tho' latest nam'd,
Ingenious Cowper.
