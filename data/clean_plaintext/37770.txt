Avaunt, the smile of youthful folly,
Since life hath lost all charms for me;
Come sullen melancholy,
And come thou dark Despondency.

How rugged is the black brown brow
Of midnight horror glooming drear;
With shagged locks impending low,
O'er deadly nightshade blooming near.

How fitted for desponding fate,
Yon wildly winding walks along;
Or seeking thro' the church-yard late,
The hoary moss-grown graves among.

Yon Widow lately pass'd them through,
With tear-worn eye and palid look;
With dark despair she's sinking low,
By yonder willow of the brook.

To her no charms the dimpling stream,
Where once the smiling man she pass'd;
All, all is fled!  and like a dream,
And all thy hopes with sorrow dash'd.

Still, still she views the chearless wave,
The wave relentless was to thee;
For low she lies in her wet grave,
All under the willow tree.
