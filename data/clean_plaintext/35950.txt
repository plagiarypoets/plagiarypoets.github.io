Mouldering away in desolated pride
Thy glory past; thy majesty remains.
Though time has torn thy pillar'd porches wide
Where echo sleeps; and horrid silence reigns.
Thus onward all things to destruction glide,
Whatever pageantries this world contains&mdash;
Decaying not o'erthrown!  thou still art seen
A monumental wreck, of what thou erst hast been.

Still let me contemplate thy wasting walls,
Thy topless columns whence the owlet screams.
Those grass-worn mounds were once baronial halls
Whose pristine worth surpasseth fancy's dreams.
There chivalry presided o'er the balls,
The sun of beauty there shed forth its beams.
Now all is loneliness &mdash; reflection, say:
How long the works of man outlive man's little day!
