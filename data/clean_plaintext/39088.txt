O blessed Pow'r, whose magic spell
The stern and rugged heart can bind;
O Thou, who only lov'st to dwell
Within the pure and spotless mind,
Leave, leave awhile thy native sky,
And list thy suppliant's song, celestial Harmony!

O, let thy gentle voice appease
The passion's loud and stormy strife;
Or rouse in moments such as these
The slumb'ring soul again to life;
When the thick blood forgets to flow,
The heart but feebly plays, the pulse beats still and slow.

Ah!  few who breathe this vital air,
But dread that wretched hour's return,
When fancied ills the bosom tear,
And life's faint embers dimly burn;
When Pity's tear has ceas'd to flow,
And dead the heart to all &mdash; alike to mirth or woe!

Then, Music, wake thy chorded shell;
And gently on the list'ning ear,
O, let the soften'd cadence dwell&mdash;
&mdash;'Tis luxury to hear&mdash;
No more to gloomy thoughts a prey,
The troubled heart relents, and casts its cares away.

And he, Misfortune's hapless child,
Within whose frantic bosom reign
Distracting fears, emotions wild,
The tumult of a dizzy train:
E'en he thy wond'rous pow'r can tell,
In passion's fiercest storm he knows, he feels it well.

Yet not to soothe man's wretched race
Thy magic sounds alone were giv'n;
Those magic sounds obtain a place
Amid the purer joys of heav'n,
E'en pleasing in his mighty eye
Who form'd both heav'n and earth, whose self is harmony.

O, breathe into the gloomy soul
So holy and so sweet a strain,
As may unseeming thoughts controul,
Restoring wonted peace again:
May ev'ry doubt and fear remove,
And almost grant on earth the bliss we hope above.
