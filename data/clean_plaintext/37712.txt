Come thou queen of pensive air,
In thy sable footed car,
By two mournful turtles drawn
Let me meet thee on yon lawn;
With decent sentiments wrapp'd around,
And thy brows with cypress bound!
Quickly come thou sober dame,
And thy musing Poet claim.
Bear me where thou lov'st to rove,
In the deep dark solemn grove,
Where on banks of velvet green,
Peace with silence still is seen:
And leisure at the sultry noon,
On flow'ry carpet flings him down,
There sweet queen, I'll sing thy pleasures,
In enthusiastick measures,
And sound thy praises through the vale,
Responsive to the hollow gale;
The murm'ring rills shall spread it round,
And grottoes the wild notes rebound.
