Muses divine which on Pernassus dwell,
Bathing your selves in Pegasean well;
Infuse high thoughts into my dullard sprite,
And guide my trembling hands, whilst I indite
The sacred honours of your fellowe Sexe,
Which mens unlawfull tirannye doth vexe.
And you three Sisters whome we Graces name,
Fayre spotlesse Virgins without fault or blame,
Bestowe some beautyes on my rugges times
That they may please our more then carping times,
And in full health preserve themselves (at least)
From sharp-tongue dartes of many headed beast.
Immortall Nectar in my minde distill,
That I may write (with favourable quill)
Womens admired gloryes and their praise.
That may be read in our next Nephewes dayes.
And you bright Lampes which to the world give light,
(Mightie Commaunders of the greatest might)
Brave Ladyes, sage Matrones, comely Damoselles,
Whose armed thoughts resist all wicked spelles,
Be you my Load starres, guide me without fayle,
Direct this little Barque (wherein I sayle)
That it may scape the sands of high disdaine,
And to the Porte of favours safely gaine.
Full well I wot, this subject was more fitte
For peerlesse Homers or for Virgil's witte.
The Florence-Petrarkes, Tassoes, or Ronsardes,
Sidneys or Spencers; unto whome, rewardes,
Garlands of Bayes by Poets graunted are.
Yet sithence one whose temples still are bare,
Whose fruitlesse braine is like a barren rocke,
A stonye ground, or over-dryed stocke,
Could thus much sing:  what might some others say?
Swannes notes excelling on their dying day.
Nor is it pride that makes me thus presume
A great Atlanticke burthen to assume.
A labour which might Hercules beseeme,
Or one whose fame the world should more esteeme.
