Syren more then earthly faire,
Sweetly breake the yeelding Ayre:
Sing on Albions whitest rockes:
Sing; whilst Willy to his Flockes,
Deftly tunes his various reede.
Sing; and hee, whilst younglings [feed,]
Answere shall thy best of singing,
With his Rurall Musicke, bringing
Equall pleasure; and requite
Musickes sweets with like delight.
What though Willyes Songs be plaine?
Sweet they be:  for hee's a Swaine
Made of purer mould then earth,
Him did Nature from his birth,
And the Muses single out,
For a second Colin Clout.
Tityrus made him a Singer:
Pan him taught his Pipe to finger:
Numbers, curious eares to please,
Learn'd he of Philisides.
Kala loves him:  and the Lasses
Point at him, as by he passes,
Wishing never tongue that's bad
Censure may so blithe a Lad.
Therefore well can he requite
Musicks sweets with like delight:
Sing then; breake the yeelding ayre,
Syren more then earthly fayre.
