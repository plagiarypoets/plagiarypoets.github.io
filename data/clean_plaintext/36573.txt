'Twas gentle eve, and from Queen Mary's bower
Sweet sounds were swelling to the purple skies,
Winged with the breath of many a weeping flower,
On which the sun laid its enamoured dyes;
And with the music murmured lowly sight,
Telling a noble spirit all undone
By the consuming fire of Beauty's eyes&mdash;
Whose is the heart that music hath not won!
Thine, Mary, all was given to that wild witching tone.

How little deemest thou, Mary, on that eve
When passion deepened on thy cheek the rose,
Of the dark web that traitorous art should weave,
The iron feud, the deadly dungeon-close!
Or of the minstrel's pang the dread repose,
When Frenzy came his matchless hand to mar!
Yet still in lovers' thoughts thy memory glows,
And Beauty sighs the strain, young Chatelar,
That witched Queen Mary's heart beneath the twilight star&mdash;

I.
Come sweet lute, and sadly tell
What my tongue dared never speak;
Like my heart with sorrow swell,
Like it, then, be hushed, and break!
Tyrant Love!  thy weary slave
Finds no refuge but the grave.

II.
List to me, thou fragrant wind!
Thou my true-love tale shalt bear;
In my Lady's tresses twined,
Fondly whisper in her ear,
That of all who round her rove,
None, like me, can die for love.

III.
Now the Christian cross I wear,
Welcome now the angry sea;
Welcome Moslem shaft and spear;
Welcome death in Galilee.
Death than sorrow is dearer far&mdash;
Now farewell, love, lute, and star!
