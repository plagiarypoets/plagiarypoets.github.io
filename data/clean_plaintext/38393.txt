Come, thou indulgent friend to soft Repose,
Whether with crimson, green, or yellow lin'd;
Come with thy downy lap, and let's embrace,
While thus supine I sink into thy arms:
When man can't saunter thro' the silent grove,
Or, under shade of tufted trees alone
Indulge in Solitude his weary hours;
When chilling damps, or Winter's nipping frost,
Denies access to silent hawthorn bow'rs,
Oh grant him Heav'n!  grant him your next best gift,
The soft, reclining, gentle, Easy Chair:
There if by gambol, or in jocund dance,
Or if by skating o'er the frozen stream
(Health-breeding Exercise) he chance to tire;
There, brisk Activity gives up her sway
And yields dominion to all-pow'rful Ease.
Hail, smiling Ease!  Philosophy's great pride,
Mother of Meditation, and the nurse
Of all the tribes in sportive Fancy's train.
Without thy care great Newton ne'er had found
The Laws of Nature, of discover'd worlds.
Hail, cheerful Ruler of the mental pow'rs!
Here now accept a Vot'ry at thy shrine,
And cheer with smiles a wearied son of Care.
