The Sun withdraws his forceful ray,
In vapoury clouds he veils his head,
And Winter half obscuring day
Arises from his icy bed:
Impetuous whirlwinds form his train,
Thick clouds and darkness round him lour;
He drives his blasts o'er every plain,
And Nature shrinks aghast, and owns his conquering pow'r.

The boisterous winds, with ceaseless roar,
Bid the rough surges proudly rise,
Impetuous beat the ravag'd shore,
And strive t' engage the frowning skies.
In snow-built car, with solemn pace,
Pale Frost glides o'er the joyless plains;
He bids the raging waters cease,
And binds the yielding waves with adamantine chains.

The trees resign their verdant hue,
And tremble at the the whirlwind's sound;
The rose, bespangled o'er with dew,
No longer sheds its fragrance round:
All beauty fades, and Winter dire,
Tremendous holds imperial sway;
The storms proclaim their powerful Sire,
And bellowing round his throne, with horrors blast the day.

If chance the breezes cease to blow,
Deep in their rocky caverns bound,
The clouds emit the treasur'd snow,
And brightness covers all the ground,
"Broad o'er the south," the Sun appears,
And faintly points his noon-tide rays,
A silvery brow the mountain bears,
Nor sheds his hoary locks, nor feels th' enfeebled blaze.

When unadorn'd the pallid morn,
Faint opening shews the leafless grove,
Oft let me tread the whiten'd lawn,
Or thro' the frozen valley rove:
On thee, great Nature, let me gaze,
Retir'd in thy sequester'd bowers,
Till Sol resumes his bright'ning blaze,
And Spring, with dewy hand, awakes the vernal flowers.
