Yon garden next demands my lay,
Where happy art conjoins
Soft pleasure with utility,
And ornament combines:
Pine apples there in beauty vie
With those that bask in native sky;
The gourd winds slowly up the wall!
There ripening hangs the mellow pear;
There twists the cooling cumcumber;
There climbs the nasturtium tall.
