Can Man in plenty thankless live,
And take, what Heav'n vouchsafes to give?
With unconcern can he behold
Yon' solar Orb of dazling Gold,
And see unmov'd, each dying plant and flow'r
Confess the fiat of its vegetative pow'r?

The lapses of the chequer'd year
Can he review, and not revere:
And, while with raptur'd eye he views,
Things form'd, and varied to his use,
Can he in lordly riot waste his days,
Nor from his heart ejaculate one note of praise?

He can &mdash; whilst he unlicens'd roves,
Thro' Sin's gay walks, and tempting groves;
Whilst yet he quaffs from pleasure's bowl
Spontaneous poison to his soul,
From Vice to Vice whilst yet he dares to roam,
And recollective thought is absent from her home.

The  Spring returns with blooming face,
The panting Summer runs its race,
Next Autumn, richest of the year,
And Winter lagging in the rear;
Yet tho' these Heralds time's swift ebb proclaim,
Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, find him still the same.

Come Gratitude, my Soul refine,
And make thy Poet half divine;
Teach me to sing in deathless lays,
My glorious benefactor's praise;
Come smiling Cherub from thy blest abode,
Uplift me on thy Plumes, and bear me to my God.
