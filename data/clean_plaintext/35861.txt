Ye Cliffs, that echo to Gaul's iron tread,
Ye Hills, whose soft turf bears the English train,
Ye Gales, whose spirit-stirring breath can spread
The bannerets of Liberty and Spain;
Say, can ye now resound the peaceful strain,
Such as ye wont, wild and irregular,
When the sweet pipe came soften'd o'er the plain,
Or lightly mingled with the gay guitar!
Can you such notes resound &mdash; or are they drown'd in War?

I sing, not I, of battles bravely won;
Not mine the "verse of tumult and of flame"
That tells the deeds of gallant Wellington,
Or consecrates the glories of the Graeme.
I sing them not &mdash; nor though one honor'd name
Woke not of Albyn's bard the peerless string,
Moore, be thy life, thy death, a better fame
Than the low dirge that, faintly carolling,
My feeble lyre could breathe, my weaker voice could sing!

Not for such lofty strain I seek thy strand,
Romantic Spain!  'Tis but to while away
The lingering hours in Fancy's fairy land,
And frame wild fictions of thy elder day:
Now the sad vision chace, now own its sway,
Tho' variable, as the fitful dream
Of brain-sick fever, the capricious lay:
Change to the subject suited well, I deem,
For Woman's is the song, and Woman is the theme.
