Wand'ring through the maze of life,
Asking, as I pass along,
What shall quell the inward strife
Of tumultuous Passions strong?
What shall happiness impart,
Satisfy the soul's desires,
Fill the vacuum of the heart,
Quench, or hallow, Nature's fires?

VAIN PHILOSOPHY.
Creeping from an hidden cave,
Thick with thorns and weeds o'ergrown,
Stalk'd a figure sternly grave,
Like a mass of skin and bone:
Such a with'red haggard Sprite,
Feeble, fault'ring, halt, and blind,
As the visions of the night
Paint on a perturbed mind.

Blink-ey'd Reason &mdash; human Lore,
Held their God on either side,
While beneath their arms they bore
Musty volumes, thick and wide.
"Hear the voice of Wisdom speak,"
Loudly his supporters cried;
"Ye that for instruction seek,
Make Philosophy your guide."

Muttering, then, in solemn tone,
Vain Philosophy began:
"I can teach, and I alone,
Truth and happiness to Man;
Would you to perfection rise,
Sit a pupil at my feet;
Mortals!  be ye good and wise,
Virtue shall the whole complete.

"I have travers'd Nature's round,
Brought its hidden stores to light
Search'd the depth of things profound&mdash;
Soar'd to objects out of sight.
I have weigh'd the human mind,
Taught the Passions each their bound,
Moral rectitude defin'd,
And with glory Virtue crown'd.

"See the volumes I have penn'd!
Study these with patient care,
Wisdom's sacred laws attend,
And to Reason bend thine ear:
Check your passions till they die&mdash;
Be your appetites withstood;
Banish fear, and pain defy;
Mortals!  be ye wise and good."

FALSE RELIGION.
Now, my wond'ring eyes behold,
Issuing as from prisons strong,
Which their massy gates unfold
To processions strange and long&mdash;
Mitred Priests and jelly Friars
Bearing crosses, shrines, and bones:
Meagre Monks with whips and briers,
Mingling stripes with piercing groans.

Following these, in strange array,
Wrinkled Abbesses appear,
Urging on the gloomy way
Victims of a vow severe;
Trickling from beneath the vail,
Many a briny tear betray'd
Nature's smother'd piteous tale
Of a lovely buried Maid.

Leader of the varied band.
Thus an Hermit silence broke:
"By the cross that bears my hand,
I submission full invoke;
Boldly Folly's fetters break,
Mortify your heart impure;
Heav'n with painful vi'lence take,
And, by penance, peace secure.

"Quench your soul's unhallow'd flames&mdash;
Fly the tempests that ye dread&mdash;
Solitude each passion tames,
Nothing wounds the peaceful dead:
Cloister'd from the busy world,
Blind to ev'ry gilded bait,
Let its thousand darts be hurl'd&mdash;
Calm is the sequester'd state.

Hope extinguish'd, cannot feel
Disappointment's cruel sting;
Love no more the heart shall steal,
Nor Ambition spread the wing:
Pomp, unseen, cannot entice;
Pride cannot lift up unknown&mdash;
Shelter'd from the snares of Vice,
Sorrow shall not cast you down."

SINFUL PLEASURE.
Tripping o'er the downy soil,
Laughing Pleasure shook her sides;
"Cease," said she, "vain Man, your toil;
Happiness with me resides:
Check your passions! &mdash; what a fool!
Would you taste supreme delight,
Give them scope, and let them rule,
They will surely govern right.

"Taste your pleasures while you may,
Every appetite employ;
Dance and sing, and sport and play,
Life and all its sweets enjoy.
Freely quaff the rosy wine,
Freely share the jovial treat;
Love and Liberty combine,
Care confound in pleasure sweet."

Then a merry crew advanc'd
Sporting wildly o'er the plains;
While in jocund gambols danc'd
Painted Nymphs and tinsell'd Swains.
Ev'ry gay alluring form&mdash;
Ev'ry brisk fantastic sound;
Ev'ry appetite to warm,
Ev'ry virtue to confound.

TRUTH.
Whilst perplex'd I sought for aid,
Doubtful how to chuse aright,
Lo! &mdash; the opening heav'ns display'd
A descending Seraph bright.
Dazzled with the rays divine,
Prostrate at her feet I fall:
"Rise," she said, with voice benign,
"I am Truth, the friend of all."

In her hands a book she held,
And in soothing accents said
"Mercy hath these pages fill'd,
Wretched, erring Man to aid;
Here, the simple heart, sincere,
Finds the straight, the hidden way;
Peace and pleasantness are here,
Light that shines to perfect day.

"'Tis not what the Sage can teach,
Void of wisdom from above,
Can the heights of knowledge reach,
Or can sound the depths of love;
Flying from the world without,
Raises not to Heav'n the mind;
Still you bear your foe about,
And but Duty leave behind.

"Filling your appointed sphere,
Bearing patiently the cross;
Losing in the strife severe
Sin's corruption, Nature's dross:
Trusting grace to bear you through,
And accept your zeal at last;
Gives to God the glory due,
Binds to man his blessings fast."

Reason, at the joyful sound,
Rent the bandage from his eyes;
Scatter'd his old books around&mdash;
Stript Philosophy's disguise:
Saw his wisdom was too weak&mdash;
Felt his errors were too strong,
Virtue of himself to seek,
Or avoid acknowledg'd wrong.

Ignorance hung down his head,
Struck with such refulgent light&mdash;
Swift his dreams of darkness fled,
Swift he took himself to flight:
Countless tribes pursu'd his track,
Bearing each some relic rare;
Male and female, white and black,
Cowl'd and mitred, shod and bare.

Empty cells and mould'ring tow'rs.
Ruins vast, they left behind,
Where the owl his prey devours,
Screaming to the whistling wind:
Cloister'd in the fractur'd pile
Reptiles loath'd their venom spent&mdash;
Types of darkness! &mdash; fierce and vile&mdash;
Superstition's monument.

Wanton Pleasure's vizor fell,
Died the roses on her brow;
Then appear'd the inward hell,
Ruin'd Reason's overthrow;
Each perverted passion felt
All the torture of abuse;
Mirth to madness turn'd, and Guilt&mdash;
Demons in the heart &mdash; broke loose.

"Come," said Truth, with gentle voice,
"Ye that pant in vain for rest!
I can make the heart rejoice;
I can calm the troubled breast&mdash;"
Lo!  a wretched crowd appears,
Trembling ev'ry step they take,
Wat'ring all their way with tears,
Sighing as their hearts would break.

THE CHARACTERS AND PASSIONS.
GUILT.
Foremost of the mournful train,
Guilt approach'd, with streaming eye;
"Ev'ry hope," said he, "is vain,
Justly I am doom'd to die:
Frighted Conscience gnaws within,
Dreads the vengeful wrath of Heav'n;
Weeps o'er mercies turn'd to sin;
Hopeless pants to be forgiv'n.

"Where can such a wretch appear?
What before my Maker plead?
Such a deep-stain'd soul to clear,
What vast hecatombs must bleed!"
Then his 'shevell'd locks he tore,
Smote his breast, and deeply groan'd,
Prostrate fell the Nymph before,
And her word his sentence own'd.

"Read," she said, "the kind decree&mdash;
Broken hearts who mercy doubt;
Come ye weary, come to me,
I will never cast you out.
Nothing as your purchase bring,
Ye nor pow'r nor merit have;
Goodness from itself doth spring;
Love, for its own sake doth save.

"Jesus, the Redeemer, stood
In the guilty sinners' place,
Shed for them his precious blood,
Richly saves them by his grace.
Justice pure, and Mercy free,
Have a wondrous transfer made;
Plac'd his righteousness on thee,
And thy sins on him hath laid.

"Look where Jesus breeding hung!
Healing balm his wounds reveal;
Ye, by fiery serpents stung.
Look, and ev'n a look shall heal."
Guilt th' atoning Lamb beheld,
And believ'd the record true;
Joy his heart, his tongue impell'd
Thus to songs of triumph new.

"Guilty Demons once resembling,
Doubting, fearing, mourning, trembling;
Life, and all its joys abusing,
Grace, and all its gifts refusing,
Mercy, and its means neglecting,
Death and Judgment dire expecting&mdash;
I a wretch despairing came.

"Rescu'd from the pit of burning,
Contrite home to God returning;
He whose anger might consume me,
And to endless horror doom me,
Turns his wrath to consolation,
Changes judgment to Salvation;
I will bless my Saviour's name.

"Wond'ring angels aid the praises
Which a ransom'd sinner raises;
Heav'nly love my heart constraining,
Grace divine my soul sustaining;
Meek, the yoke of duty bearing,
Grateful joy and glory sharing&mdash;
I will boundless Grace proclaim."

FEAR.
Shrinking from imagin'd foes,
Scar'd with shadows like a child,
Struggling with heart-rending woes&mdash;
Fear approach'd with aspect wild.
Viewing soon the Seraph fair,
Beaming goodness with her smile,
Goodness fill'd him with despair,
"I'm a wretch," he cried, "too vile.

"How!  or whither shall I fly?"
Fear exclaim'd with piercing cry:
"All within is stubborn sin;
All around are pits profound;
All behind I vengeance find;
All to come is dreadful doom;
All above is slighted love;
All beneath is endless death;
I must &mdash; and yet I cannot, dare not die!

"Thorns and briers,
Floods and fires;
Fears and cares,
Traps and snares;
Tempests howling,
Lions prowling;
Bitter losses,
Heavy crosses.

"Thunders bursting o'er my head
Scare me ev'ry step I tread;
O'er my slumbers spectres hover,
Dreadful foes my days discover;
Mists obscure my devious track,
On I dare not move, nor back;
Here I must not, cannot stay,
Nor one step can urge my way:
Hide!  oh, hide me!  ye that can&mdash;
From myself &mdash; from God and Man!"

"Hear," said Truth, "the message hear&mdash;
Who the path of duty tread;
Who th' Almighty God revere,
None beside shall have to dread.
Trust to his unfailing pow'r&mdash;
Dare not sin against his love;
And in ev'ry trying hour
You his ready grace shall prove.

"Present things, or things to come,
Life or death, or fiends unseen,
Shall not all combin'd presume
To disturb their souls serene:
What can separate from love?
What subdue Omnipotence?
Depths beneath, and heights above,
All unite in their defence.

"As the tenant of the rock
Fearless hears the surges beat,
And beholds their threat'ned shock
Languish harmless at his feet;
So whose faith on God relies,
Rests on a foundation sure;
'Mid the wreck of earth and skies
He shall smile in strength secure."

At Jehovah's awful name
Reverence bow'd his spirit low;
Faith, and Hope, and Courage, came,
Conquering ev'ry fear and foe.
Then with heav'nly strength endu'd,
Clad in panoply divine;
Like a lion he pursu'd,
Dauntless, Truth's unerring line,

"God is my refuge, tow'r, and shield,
I will not to the Tempter yield,
Nor shall my courage fail;
Let Earth and Hell their force unite
Beneath the banners that I fight,
I surely shall prevail.

"Tho' Nature with convulsions shake,
And mountains from their bases break,
And rush into the sea;
The God of Nature is my guard,
And his pavilion is prepar'd,
An hiding-place for me.

"Should famine round the world prevail,
The fruits and flocks of Nature fail,
And leave a dreary void;
My soul shall joy in God alone,
And him my full salvation own,
Were all the world destroy'd.

"Tho' snares and dangers strew the ground,
Angelic hosts encamp around,
With watchful guardian love;
My shield shall quench the darts of hell,
My sword shall be invincible,
And I shall conqueror prove.

"When thro' the shades of death I tread,
I will not the dark valley dread
God will be with me there;
And though his rod my flesh may pain,
His staff my spirits shall sustain,
And through the conflict bear.

"When from the dust my frame shall rise,
'Mid flaming worlds and falling skies,
I'll lift my head with joy;
With triumph through the clouds ascend,
And in my Judge behold my friend,
Who shall my foes destroy."

CARE.
Then came Care with wrinkled brow,
Tott'ring limbs, and hoary hairs,
Forc'd beneath his load to bow,
Bags and bonds, and vast affairs:
Wildly round he turn'd his eyes,
Clasp'd his bags and parchments fast;
Dreading robbers in disguise,
At his shadow stood aghast.

"How," he cried, "shall I secure,
Years to come, my goods in peace&mdash;
'Scape the curse of being poor,
And my hoarded store increase?
War may desolate the land,
Famine pine for plenty past;
Plunder'd by some ruffian's hand,
I may come to want at last!"

"Read," said Truth, "the sacred word,
Ye who of your cares complain;
Cast your burdens on the Lord,
He shall all their weight sustain.
Nature's loads on him depend;
Air, and Earth, and Ocean's deep;
Spirits, that in light transcend;
Reptiles, that in ashes creep.

"See the beauteous lily grow,
See the cheerful sparrow fly,
These no anxious morrow know,
Yet they daily find supply:
He that doth the sparrow feed,
He that clothes the lily gay,
Knows the things your natures need,
Spreads your table ev'ry day.

"Would you riches? &mdash; haste and buy
Heav'nly treasure free from cost&mdash;
Time, and vast eternity,
Shall not then your store exhaust.
Would you 'scape destruction's pow'r,
Hoard your wealth above the skies;
There, nor moths nor rust devour,
There, no robber can surprise."

List'ning Care perceiv'd his cure,
And his bags disdain'd to bear:
"Take," he cried, "ye needy poor,
That abundance I can spare.
Trusting the Almighty hand,
I shall want, shall wish no more;
Guards angelic round me stand,
Goodness makes my cup run o'er.

"Why should I waste my fleeting days?
Around the earth for wealth to range;
Or toil, security to raise,
Upon a world of ceaseless change?

"Why should I vex my aching head;
Or rend with fear my anxious heart?
Who soon must, mingling with the dead,
For ever from the world depart.

"Why should I hoard for years to come?
Who cannot e'en a moment claim;
Or with so weak a mind presume
The watchful care of God to blame?

"Ah, no I will in God confide,
Whose hand upholds the earth and sky;
My ev'ry want he hath supply'd,
And will support me till I die."

LOVE.
Then, with slow and solemn tread,
Love, a blighted passion, came:
Drooping roses girt her head,
Sable sackcloth cloth'd her frame.
Sighing deep, as from the tomb,
Thus, in plaintive sounds, she spake:
"Bear me swiftly to my doom,
I will this false world forsake.

"I listen'd, alas!  to the tale,
For pleasing my tempter appear'd;
But now his fair promises fail;
Another the fable hath heard
Oh, Damon!  my false-hearted swain,
Assist me lost comfort to find;
Oh, give me my heart back again,
Or take your dear form from my mind."

Smiling with compassion mild,
Truth address'd the love-lorn maid:
"Hear," she said, "mistaken child!
How thy erring heart bath stray'd,
Put not in a creature trust,
More inconstant than the wind;
They who build in feeble dust
Soon shall leave the wreck behind.

"He that made thee what thou art
Claims thee as his temple still;
He alone deserves the heart&mdash;
He alone the heart can fill.
Who such ardent love can shew?
Who can equal charms display?
Who with gentler voice can woo?
Rise, my fair one, come away!

"Him thy first affections give,
Let thy vows to Heav'n ascend;
His eternal love receive,
Firm and faithful to the end.
Then, thy happy heart shall know
Rightly creatures to esteem,
And with purer, warmer glow.
Love them for the sake of Him."

As when southern breezes blow,
Melting winter's icy chain,
Swift the loosened waters flow
To the bosom of the main;
So the cheering voice of Truth
Love releas'd from things beneath;
Heav'nly ardour fir'd her youth,
And to rapture tun'd her breath.

"Oh!  aid me, ye glorified spirits above,
To sing in fit accents the Fountain of Love:
Majestic in glory, transcendent in grace,
More bright than the sun are the beams of his face.

"Creation's vast beings, from earth to the skies,
His wisdom hath form'd and his goodness supplies;
He gives me my life, and my health, and my food,
And he makes e'en my sorrow to work for my good.

"Thro' fire, and thro' water, my stay he appears,
On mountains of pleasure, in valleys of tears;
He helps me unhurt on the serpent to tread,
Nor suffers his thunders to burst on my head.

"He cheers my dark nights, and he gilds my bright day,
And saves me from dangers that lurk in my way;
He conquers my foes, and he softens my cares,
And sweetens the joys that his bounty prepares.

"Tho' false and ungrateful my heart hath oft been,
He bears with my manners, and pardons my sin;
And when he corrects me, as often I need,
'Tis mercy that melts me, and makes my heart bleed.

"He stoop'd to my lowness to raise me on high,
And sav'd me from dying by deigning to die:
He put on my vileness, that so I might wear
His name and his merits, his triumphs to share.

"The work he hath finish'd, and now he is gone
To claim the rich kingdom his conquest hath won:
There, clad in the vesture his crimson blood dy'd,
Makes ready the mansion and crown for his bride.

"Away then the idols my heart would inshrine,
Your love is but hatred, to favour divine:
What he gives with himself, I with pleasure will take,
And love as his creatures, but love for his sake."

ANGER.
Next in most terrific form,
Foaming as when billows roar,
Loud as the destructive storm,
Vengeful as the wounded boar:
Darting fury from his eyes&mdash;
Furrow'd with a ghastly frown,
Anger &mdash; hoarse with raving, cries&mdash;
"Death shall my displeasure crown!"

Then a blood-stain'd blade he drew,
And the blunted edge renew'd;
'Gainst an oak with fury flew,
And his hands with gore imbru'd.
Loud as thunders rend the sky,
"Where's my foe?"  exclaim'd the Fiend;
But no enemy was nigh,
With the madman to contend.

Then with fearful oaths he swore,
Stamp'd, as he would crush the ground,
And his flesh with transport tore,
Rushing fiercely all around:
"Yes," he cried, "ye idle names,
Slumb'ring on the seat of pow'r,
I will seize your useless flames&mdash;
Teach your lightnings to devour.

"Deal destruction to my foe,
He shall never be forgiv'n;
Else I'll Nature's self o'erthrow,
And assault the heights of Heav'n."
Then he rent his tatter'd vest&mdash;
Strove to beat the fleeting wind
Bit his lips, and smote his breast,
Curst himself and all mankind.

"Wretched mortal," Truth exclaim'd,
"Chase thy barb'rous passions hence!
Dares thy impious heart untam'd
Rise against Omnipotence?
Tremble lest resistless wrath,
Such as on proud Pharaoh fell,
Crush thee into instant death,
Mix'd with furies vile, of hell.

"Are the thunderbolts withheld?
Tho' the punishment were just
And art thou with rage impell'd
'Gainst thy feeble fellow dust?
Would'st thou pardon, yet receive!
Suff'ring love for sinners see;
And thy brother still forgive,
As thy God forgiveth thee.

"Vengeance, saith the Lord, is mine;
'Justice pure, to me belongs:&mdash;'
Patient, meek forbearance thine,
Goodness overcoming wrongs;
Would you forcibly reprove,
Make the eye obdurate weep;
Coals, that fury melt to love,
Thus upon the heart you heap."

As when boist'rous winds subside,
Waves contending beat no more,
And the late tumultuous tide
Peaceful glides along the shore;
So the Seraph, breathing balm,
Bid the gust of passion cease&mdash;
Anger felt the inward calm,
Soften'd into smiles of peace.

"Ye demons," he said, "from my bosom depart,
Too long ye have torn and tormented my heart;
Ye made me, while panting for vengeance and blood,
A foe to my neighbour, a rebel to God.
My reason and conscience with passions engaging,
With all, with myself, fierce warfare still waging;
My wounds know no healing nor comfort assuaging&mdash;
Horrid schemes,
Fearful dreams,
Day and night my soul enraging."

"Now the tranquil calm I feel
Gently o'er my spirits steal;
Now my soften'd heart expands,
And to friendship prompts my hands;
Now my bosom would embrace
Peacefully the human race.
Cheering, as when op'ning day
Chases night's cold shades away,
So the beams of love divine
Warm and cheer this soul of mine.
Less the glory, toil, or gain,
Cities to subdue and chain,
Than the struggle hard to win
O'er the stubborn foe within.
Mighty love can rage control,
Drive the savage from the soul;
Love alone the deed can do,
Gently, wrath itself subdue,
And in sweetest concord bind
Earth and Heav'n and all mankind.

IMPATIENCE.
As the cloud by whirlwinds torn,
As the meteor's restless flame&mdash;
Swift on wings of fancy borne,
Mutable Impatience came.
Here and there his eyes he cast,
Catching bubbles as they flew;
Scorning present things and past,
Still he sought for something new.

Time had on his brow imprest
Wrinkled marks of many a year;
But, of ev'ry good possest,
No enjoyment yet was near.
He would scheme, and he would bait,
Spread the sail, and urge the plough,
But he scorn'd on Time to wait;
"Give," he cried, "my portion now!

"Shall this free-born soul of mine
Tamely 'neath oppression groan;
Meekly to the Cross resign,
Stoop to sufferings yet unknown?
No &mdash; I hate the shameful yoke,
I will from the furnace fly;
Now, shall all my bands be broke,
Or, I'll boldly dare to die."

Truth the fleeting phantom staid,
Made him for a moment sure;
"Hear," exclaim'd the gentle maid,
"I can disappointment cure."
"When?" &mdash; with eager voice he cried,
Turning hasty steps away&mdash;
"Now," the gracious form replied,
"Now &mdash; and ev'ry future day.

"Disappointment is the source
Whence your present mis'ry springs;
Expectation is the course
Which that disappointment brings;
From desires that know no mean,
Ardent expectation flows,
And desire for ever keen
From impatience restless, grows.

"Happiness is round you spread,
But the sacred gift is vain
You to ev'ry good are dead,
Save the good you cannot gain.
Seeking visionary joy,
You the bliss you have refuse,
And by eagerness destroy
E'en the future good you chuse.

"So the child that strays unseen
Restless roves the garden o'er,
Plucks disease from fruits yet green,
And defeats kind Autumn's store.
Round the hind's unwearied toil
Cold may freeze, and heat may burn,
Yet, at length, the grateful soil
Pays in harvest full return.

"Patience lightens half the load
Which Complaint shall doubly bear;
Stubbornness shall feel the goad
Which submissive minds shall spare.
Ev'ry bleak and wintry storm
Which the winds of life may send,
Shall the mind to patience form,
And in heav'nly harvest end."

Thwarted by tempestuous winds,
Beaten by opposing tides&mdash;
Bless'd his port, the seaman finds
Where his bark in safety rides:
So Impatience wept at last
Wishes vain and toil mispent&mdash;
Hope his anchor gladly cast
In the harbour of Content.

"Why should I wish my life away,
As though I thought my span too long;
Or chide swift-footed Time's delay,
As if his steps were measur'd wrong?
The point I seek will soon be near,
And then &mdash; as swiftly disappear.

"Each day a mingled portion brings
Of good and evil, grief and joy,
And thus the well-pois'd scale of things
Doth the extreme of each destroy:
But peevish grief, and mirth's excess,
Make sorrows more, and pleasures less.

The good I seek may never come,
It may in goodness be deny'd&mdash;
Or were a lighter cross my doom,
I might be puff'd away with pride.
Then I'll be still, and quiet rest,
God's choice &mdash; and way &mdash; and time &mdash; are best."

SORROW.
Then with slow and solemn tread,
Pallid look and tearful eye,
As a phantom from the dead,
Sorrow's with'red shade drew nigh,
Clad in mourning weeds of death&mdash;
In her hands a willow bough&mdash;
And a faded cypress wreath
Droop'd upon her sickly brow.

Dreadful groans her bosom heav'd,
Deep as earth's convulsive throe;
Mournful as the dove bereav'd&mdash;
Piercing as the shriek of woe:
Frantic driv'n by dire despair,
Hard she smote her lab'ring breast;
Wrung her hands and rent her hair,
And her sorrows thus exprest:

"Woe is me!  my heart is breaking,
Ev'ry hope my soul forsaking,
I am grief's devoted prey:
As malignant blasts consuming,
Nip the buds of Nature blooming,
So my joys have died away.

"Ere life's scanty pleasures tasting,
I with eager step am hasting
To the gloomy shades below.
Is, O Death!  thy mission ended?
Why is still thy dart suspended?
Pierce, and case a heart of woe.

"Swift, alas!  didst thou bereave me,
And an helpless widow leave me,
Dragging vile existence on;
Now, Destroyer!  I defy thee,
And a keener stroke deny thee&mdash;
Joy and hope are ever gone.

"Cheerful sun, forbear thy shining,
Leave in shades a wretch repining,
From thy splendid orbit fall:
Nature's gaudy scenes around me
But with deeper anguish wound me;
With myself I'd ruin all."

"Peevish dust," said Truth, "forbear!
Shall a living soul complain?
Shall a worm presumpt'ous dare
Heav'nly wisdom to arraign?
All the suff'rings thou hast felt,
All thou canst sustain below,
Are but little to thy guilt,
Are but short to endless woe.

"He that sent thee gifts belov'd
Saw thy heart with earth content,
And in tenderness remov'd
What awhile his wisdom lent.
How the harden'd heart to break,
How the troubled to compose,
What to give, and when to take,
Best unerring goodness knows.

"Rescu'd from the ills to come;
Of unsullied joys possess'd;
Fix'd in an eternal home,
See thy child &mdash; thy husband rest!
Mould'ring in the silent dust,
Tho' they left their flesh behind;
Faithful to the sacred trust,
Earth shall yield their flesh refin'd.

"Dare not, murmuring, censure God,
Lest you sink beneath his stroke&mdash;
Patience learns from ev'ry rod,
Meekness triumphs in the yoke:
Ask, and he will mercy show,
You sufficient grace shall find.
Then, the storm that rolls below,
Shall not reach your peaceful mind.

"Mark Messiah's grief extreme,
Man of sorrows, Lord of bliss!
What art thou compar'd with Him,
What thy woe compared to his?
Yet on Him did vengeance fall,
Suff'ring, dying, for thy sake!
He hath drunk the dregs of gall,
You but of a drop partake."

As when wintry storms are past,
Soon the cheerful spring appears,
And the smiling sun at last
Dries reviving Nature's tears:
Sorrow cast her sackcloth down,
And the robe of praise put on,
Smil'd away her ghastly frown&mdash;
Chang'd her mourning thus to song:

"Hence repining, base dejection!
Ye that form'd a hell within&mdash;
Shall I grieve at just correction,
When I ought to grieve for sin?
Shall a soul that yet is living,
Of the fruit of guilt complain?
Senseless while the good is giving,
Feeling but from sense of pain.

"All my sorrows and denials,
All a creature here can know,
Are but momentary trials,
When compar'd with endless woe.
Pain or pleasure transitory,
Now my faith compares aright,
With the weight of endless glory,
Are as fleeting atoms light.

"Ere I suff'red sharp affliction,
I, a wand'ring sheep, would roam;
But correction brought conviction,
And conviction forc'd me home.
Wisdom's wondrous dealings viewing,
Happiness I feel renew'd;
God is fitly all things doing,
Making all things work for good."

SCANDAL.
Scandal, with malicious grin,
Looking round with scowling leer,
Talking with unceasing din&mdash;
Like a wintry blast, drew near:
Nature trembled at her tread&mdash;
Ev'ry bird forbore his song;
Ev'ry flower hung down its head,
Drooping as she pass'd along.

Henbane, waving in the wind,
Night-shade, pluck'd from pits beneath&mdash;
And a rose or two intwin'd,
Slily snatch'd from Merit's wreath;
These her locks Medusian drest,
Where the hissing aspic clung;
And beneath her whiten'd vest
The assassin's dagger hung.

Following swift the steps of Fame,
To destroy his plaudits bent;
All was friendship where she came,
All was venom whence she went.
Phials, fill'd with poisons rare,
Killing without sense of pain,
She would pour in Folly's ear,
And to madness turn the brain.

Innocence her magic felt&mdash;
Soon, some self-made spot she found,
Turn'd infirmity to guilt,
And as pitying smote the wound.
Did unguarded Nature fall?
Swift the dire report she spread;
Triumph'd in a neighbour's thrall,
Trampled on the bruised head.

"See!" she said, and turn'd her eyes
Where Truth's votaries were seen,
"Ye have thought them good and wise,
Honest men, and vestals clean.
Mark the voice of Candour well,
Ye that trust appearance fair;
I, in secrecy, will tell
How exceeding frail they are."

"Impious wretch," said Truth, "begone!
Child of idleness and shame&mdash;
Dares thy pestilential tongue
God defy and man defame?
Thy mischievous member, know
Virtue's patient scorn and doom,
Kindled by the flames below,
Shall thyself at last consume."

As the meteor's lurid blaze
Vanishes in empty smoke,
And the clown's astonish'd gaze
Ends in some contemptuous joke:&mdash;
Cover'd with confusion strong,
Having not one word to say,
Thus, the undeceived throng
Hiss'd her with contempt away.

AMBITION.
Stalking stately o'er the plain,
Lifting high his lordly brow,
Came Ambition, proud and vain;
Whilst the crowds around him bow.
Gaudy ribbons deck'd his coat,
Powder'd slaves behind him range,
And upon his crown were wrote
Pompous titles, long and strange.

On his breast a spangled star
Sparkling o'er a vest of gold,
Shew'd that his was nobler far
Than a frame of vulgar mould.
Flatt'ry, with affected smile,
Awkwardly his praises sung,
And a group of harpies vile,
Close dependants, round him clung.

"Ye slaves that on my steps attend,"
He rudely spake in haughty tone,
"Bend low, to your superior bend,
And me your Lord, my vassals own.
Copious in my untainted veins,
Pure crimson tides of honour run;
High honour, that its course maintains,
Flowing direct from sire to son.

"I, by no vulgar bounds confin'd,
My ample swing of pleasure take,
For laws the little only bind;
Enough for us the laws to make.
Descent my privilege secures,
Inherited from ancient line;
But poverty and toil are yours,
While wealth and happiness are mine.

"Ye men of letters &mdash; men of trade!
And ye who raise the bread I eat;
Ye were for mean submission made;
Come pour your tributes at my feet.
I need not useless wisdom learn,
Nor yet to shameful labour bend;
For you, the duty is to earn&mdash;
For me, the privilege to spend.

"Projects immense and schemes sublime
My most capacious bosom fill;
Clear ye the way &mdash; for I will climb
The foremost up steep Grandeur's hill.
Trampling the base-born rabble down&mdash;
Excluding thence each bold compeer&mdash;
I that so well could wear a crown,
Will not endure a rival near."

"Cease," said Truth, "vain boaster, cease!
Let not folly worth deride;
From thy poverty's increase
Springs thy littleness of pride.
On thy tinsell'd garb is seen
Honour's mimick'd form imprest,
But a spirit worse than mean
Lurks beneath thy star-clad breast.

"Seeking praise with anxious heart,
Cringing to the shade of state&mdash;
Thou in greatness nothing art,
Thou in nothingness art great.
Thine impoverish'd empty soul,
Grasping earth with eager haste,
Thankless, would engross the whole,
And a world of blessings waste.

"Dost thou consequence assume
From the fame thy fathers built?&mdash;
Honour finds in you its tomb,
Thou art but the sire of Guilt.
Gen'rous deeds of virtuous fame
Are by thee despis'd, unknown;
Vice and folly, pride and shame,
Sin and death, are all thine own.

"Art thou puff'd with flatt'ry base?
Such as knaves on fools bestow,
Flying in thy Maker's face,
Courting poor applause below?
God, the great, the wise, the just,
Will thy haughty spirit tame;
Crush thee to ignoble dust,
Doom thee to eternal shame.

"Is it wealth &mdash; a useless store&mdash;
Swells thy pride, or lulls thy ease?
Know thy sordid heart is poor,
If it claims no good but these.
God, thou fool!  this very night,
May thy guilty soul demand.
And his trust abus'd requite
With a master's vengeful hand."

At a master's hateful name,
Haughty Greatness grasp'd his sword,
Swore the wretch that dar'd defame,
Libel, and traduce a lord,
Should his warlike vengeance move;
Mutt'ring as he stalk'd away&mdash;
"Who are you that dare reprove?
Who the God that I obey?"

ENVY.
Envy then, a spectre vile,
Jaundic'd o'er with sickly hue,
Sneering with contemptuous smile
At the crowd he shuffled through&mdash;
Elbowing each, on either side,
Rudely he approach'd the Saint&mdash;
"Hear!" he impudently cried,
"I am come to make complaint.

"Foremost of the human race&mdash;
Full of virtue, full of grace;
I, whose diligence hath tried
More than any hands beside:
I, whose prudence knows to shun
Ev'ry crime by mortals done;
I, whose wisdom doth discern
What no other soul can learn
Can I base neglect survive,
While my worthless neighbours thrive?

"Some whose talents I despise,
Blundering on good fortune, rise;
Seeming not to know, or care,
Ever they successful are;
High applause and many a friend
Still each paltry scheme attend;
While a genius, such as mine,
Must depress'd, neglected, pine.
Well may rage my spirits seize,
At such partial gifts as these!

"Oft, my watchful eyes have seen
Pleasure with a portion mean;
Poor the lot and coarse the fare,
Yet Content sat smiling there;
Toilsome, low, and hard their part,
Yet they sung for joy at heart.
Much it grieves me to perceive,
Happy, how such wretches live.
While the plenty I possess,
Finds, and leaves me comfortless."

"Know," said Truth, "thy murmuring mind
Poison draws from Nature's food;
To thy own enjoyments blind,
Thou art curst, from others good:
Didst thou thine own meanness know&mdash;
Less than thy least mercy sent;
Praise would in thy bosom glow,
Bursting now with discontent.

"Look around thee, thou shalt see,
While thou dar'st at Heav'n repine,
Thousands, worthier far than thee,
With a portion less than thine.
Thou dost thine own bliss destroy,
Prompt with hellish skill to gain:
Sorrow, from another's joy&mdash;
Pleasure, from another's pain."

Cover'd with confusion deep,
Scorn'd and hated all around&mdash;
Mere vexation made him weep,
And himself in madness wound.
As before the opening day,
Shades and beasts of blood depart&mdash;
Envy growl'd, and stole away,
While the viper gnaw'd his heart.

FRIENDSHIP.
Then, with firm and manly air,
Open arms and naked breast,
Where, as through a crystal fair,
Honest Faith was seen imprest&mdash;
Friendship, poor and lonely, came,
Yet, while coming, he bestow'd
Half the crust, his hunger's claim,
On a beggar in his road.

O'er his weather-beaten face
Treach'ry spread a look unkind;
And he pry'd about the place,
Dreading Falsehood there to find.
Truth his sad suspicions knew,
Bid him all his griefs unfold,
Which, as near the maid he drew,
Thus with mingled sighs he told:

"In early days, my fond affections twin'd
Around the dear companion of my youth,
Our bodies seem'd to share one common mind,
Our spirits harmoniz'd with seeming truth.

"The sports of childhood, the pursuits of men,
We plann'd together, and together shar'd;
Our joys were mutual, or not relish'd then,
And in our sorrows each for other car'd.

"My purse was heavy, and my heart was light,
And the wide world alluring pleasures spread
Mirth spent the day, and madness chas'd the night,
We laugh'd at sorrow, and we scorn'd to dread.

"At length slow-creeping Poverty appear'd,
And brought grim Want usurping Plenty's seat;
Then keen Reproach at my affliction jeer'd,
Care rack'd my head, and dangers snar'd my feet.

"Yet one fond hope my flatt'ring heart had left&mdash;
I'll fly the storm and to my Friend repair,
He shar'd my plenty, and, now I'm bereft,
I will his oft-pledged faith and bounty share.

"I sought, but sought my once-lov'd Friend in vain&mdash;
For he that oft the tender name would boast,
My misery heard with distant cold disdain,
And shunn'd me as Profusion's haggard ghost.

"Faithless, ah, now!  the heart of man I find!
And cover'd but with flimsy semblance fair&mdash;
Henceforth I'll shun and hate all human kind&mdash;
O Man!  of faithless, treach'rous man beware."

"Injur'd Spirit!"  Truth reply'd,
"Harbour not the thought unjust,
God hath man to man allied,
And connected faith with trust.
But thy inexperienc'd mind
Form'd the fellowship of sin,
Friendship sought with folly join'd;
Guilt without and grace within.

"You whose feeble spirit faints,
Sinking through earth's treacherous sod;
Seek the fellowship of saints,
Seek the fellowship of God.
He the Spirit never leaves
That upon his word depends;
Closer than a brother cleaves,
Best of fathers, best of friends.

"Friendship, hallow'd and sincere,
Issues from its fount above,
And reflects in channels clear
Semblance of the God of Love.
As the sacred unction spread
Down to Aaron's garment's hem,
So from Christ, his people's head,
Sacred love descends to them.

"Members of a mystic frame
Each the general feelings own,
And the joy or sorrow claim,
By remotest branches known."
At the damsel's cheering voice
Purer love within him sprung;
Friendship made a wiser choice,
And his new-felt pleasure sung.

"Companions of my folly past,
My wasted love restore;
I'll chuse a better part at last,
And sin with you no more.

"Oft have we made each other vile,
Each other led astray;
Now share with me a nobler toil,
And urge a purer way.

"Ye little flock who pasture keep
Where'er your Guide doth lead,
May I, a stray'd, returning sheep,
Among you rest and feed!

"Ye sacred plants of sweet perfume,
In heav'nly tints array'd,
Who like the humble violet bloom,
And scent unseen the shade:

"Transplanted I with you would grow
In Zion's garden fair,
And, like some little flow'ret, blow
Among the lilies there.

"Ye suff'ring Saints, I value more
The crosses ye sustain,
Than all the pleasures fools adore,
So sinful, short, and vain.

"The proudly great, and worldly wise,
Your lot contemptuous view,
But in the cottage they despise,
Smiles peace they never knew.

"I would no more a stranger roam;
But as a brother true,
Would dwell a citizen at home
In fellowship with you.

"Attracted now, great Source of Love!
My soul to Thee ascends;
May I thy faithful follower prove,
The humblest of thy friends!

"In rags disgrac'd, by guilt defil'd,
The prodigal receive;
Father but own thy long-lost child,
And then the dead shall live.

"As shoot the tendrils of the vine,
And climb some nobler tree,
So would my feeble soul intwine,
And rise to Heav'n with Thee."

CONCLUSION.
BIGOTRY.
Then with visage fiercely grim,
Wrinkled deep with horrid frown,
Son of Ignorance and Whim,
Deck'd with Folly's leaden crown;
Bigot Zeal march'd swift along,
Dragging numbers close behind;
But a bandage thick and strong
Held their eyes in darkness blind.

His right hand a parchment held,
Wrote with characters obscure;
Which his slaves, by rage impell'd,
Vow'd was doctrine just and pure,
With his left he wav'd a sword,
Swearing by the God on high,
He who dar'd to doubt one word,
Should an unbeliever die.

Some, by such a threat alarm'd,
Ran their terrors to assuage.
Whom the magic fillet charm'd
Soon to equal pride and rage.
Some, who dar'd their bands to break,
Wise their errors past to own,
Rous'd his anger thus to speak
Loud in dictatorial tone:

"In me, O Truth!  behold thy champion near,
Chastising those who for themselves would think;
My pointed sword shall teach thy foes to fear,
Whose little souls from my great doctrines shrink.
Yes, they shall turn,
Or madly burn,
Who dare presume my light supreme to spurn.

"Can I be wrong, who so much comprehend,
That common spirits never could attain?
Can I mistake, who am so much thy friend,
And with such force uphold thy mighty reign?
By me alone
Thy will is known,
And all the earth shall bow before thy throne.

"But why, O Truth!  art thou so poorly meek,
To yield to Error such a lengthen'd course?
Why dost thou gently thus thy converts seek,
Who couldst command their rebel hearts by force?
In dread array
Maintain thy sway,
And burn the world, or make the world obey."

"Wretch!" said Truth, "thy temper's base,
Cruel zeal and dogmas strange
Do Religion's name disgrace,
And its love to hatred change.
Spurning Mercy's milder way
Thou wouldst ev'ry conscience seize,
And thy wiser brother slay,
God, the merciful, to please.

"Impudent is thy pretence
Fetters on the soul to bind;
Claiming high Omnipotence,
Bold to think for all mankind.
Know that Truth disdains thy aid,
Scorns thy dungeon, fire, and chain&mdash;
I by argument persuade,
And with love alone constrain.

"Faith, however strong or sound,
Will an empty phantom prove,
Where no holy fruits are found&mdash;
Where the heart is void of love.
Shall, then, blind presuming man
Mere opinion dare to give,
As the sum of Wisdom's plan&mdash;
Damning all who disbelieve?"

But, alas!  her words were vain,
Truth her pearls to swine had cast;
Bigotry would still maintain
All his errors to the last.
Scornfully he turn'd aside,
Urging thence his stubborn throng:
Swearing, Truth herself had lied&mdash;
He was right, and she was wrong.

ENTHUSIASM.
Next, Imagination's child,
Bringing fancies new and rare,
Came Enthusiasm wild,
Treading lightly as on air.
Poppies twin'd, a garland gay,
Girt his visionary head,
And amid the blaze of day,
Their somnific virtues shed.

Now he rais'd his slumb'ring eyes,
Fixing them upon the clouds,
Reading marvels in the skies
To the puzzled gaping crowds.
Much of wondrous dreams he spake,
And of inspiration high;
How the soul should prison break,
And to worlds of rapture fly.

"Yes, I am come," he said, "to tell
Of things that Truth but half reveals;
The heights of Heav'n, the depths of Hell,
And all, Eternity conceals.

"I have on cloudless ether trod,
With disembodied spirits been;
Have mystic converse held with God,
And things invisible have seen.

"I that have read the Book of Fate,
And drank at Wisdom's fount sublime;
Prophetically will relate
The hidden deeds of distant time;

"What despot shall a land inthral,
And who shall cast the tyrant down;
What monarchy shall rise or fall,
Or whom fierce war shall victor crown.

"Enrapt in ecstacy divine,
Above the world I take my flight,
And a bright constellation shine,
Amid the little stars of night.

"What are Instruction's means to me?
For low inquiry springs from doubt;
I that within the veil can see,
Will worship now no more without.

"High favour'd with peculiar grace
I view the scenes to man unknown;
The glory of th' empyreal space,
The splendour of Jehovah's throne."

"Stay," said Truth, "Fanatic stay!
Trusting a deceitful heart,
Thou hast wander'd far astray,
And a soul deluded art.
He who quits his Spirit's guide,
Anxious novel paths to try,
Soon shall rove in error wide,
And believe his fancied lie.

"Now, the Scriptures are complete,
Now, the Gospel day appears;
Shades of ancient night retreat,
And the dreams of darker years.
God, to keep his Church secure,
Hath the certain doctrine giv'n;
And the living word is sure&mdash;
More, than mystic voice from Heav'n.

"Satan can himself transform,
And in robes of light beguile;
Souls, that might endure his storm,
He may cheat with artful wile.
Feeble, foolish man!  beware,
Lest aspiring, deep you fall&mdash;
Caught within the hidden snare,
And too late for succour call.

"Who is he that dares to seize
Judgment with presumption bold?
Ransack the supreme decrees.
And the roll of Fate unfold?
Rather study to discern
Where thy peace, thy safety lies;
Duty and dependence learn,
None but humble souls are wise."

"Cease!" he said, "such common themes,
Which have check'd my flight too long;
Now my soul with wonder teems,
Lo!  I feel an impulse strong."
Lull'd with the ecstatic fire,
Nodding with his bliss supreme,
Down he plung'd into the mire,
Boasting purity extreme.

Now a motley crowd appear'd,
Far and wide as eye could range;
Each impatient to be heard,
Ceaseless utter'd questions strange:
"What is Truth, and which the way?"
Each with eagerness inquir'd,
And before the Maid could say,
Each as eagerly retir'd.

Some with curious spirit sought
Far in myst'ry's depths to gaze,
And by subtile reasonings caught,
Wander'd blind in Error's maze.
Some possess'd of airy schemes,
Forming systems of their own,
Truth would daze with borrow'd beams,
Fix their idols on her throne.

Some with impudence profane
Call'd themselves her brethren true,
And would claim relation vain,
Whilst they nothing of her knew.
Diff'rent sects, a varied host,
Each themselves her fav'rites thought,
Made of kindred mighty boast,
And each other fiercely fought.

Then approach'd a studious train,
Learned Doctors of the schools&mdash;
They adjudg'd her themes too plain,
Only fit to tutor fools.
But her plainness soon they cur'd,
Commenting with critic lore;
And with letter'd art obscur'd
What they deem'd too clear before.

Then, in hostile form array'd,
March'd a frantic, furious brood,
With the Cross of Peace pourtray'd
On their banners stain'd with blood.
Dread anathemas they hurl'd&mdash;
Stubborn souls refin'd with flame
Spread destruction round the world&mdash;
Murder'd in the Saviour's name.

"Humble souls," said Truth, "beware
Ye who wisdom seek to know;
These &mdash; who proud my titles bear,
Each I count my bitter foe.
Human force, or human skill,
Cannot change the inward soul;
Teach the mind, or bind the will,
Or the passions vile, control.

"Soft and gentle is my sway,
'Tis with cords of love I bind&mdash;
None my doctrines can obey,
But the lowly, willing mind.
Such shall find the narrow path;
Such shall think, shall act aright;
Such shall live, shall walk by faith,
To the realms of perfect light."

As she spake, a sacred ray
O'er each list'ning Spirit shin'd;
Chasing swift her foes away,
As the chaff before the wind.
Cruelty gave up the ghost;
Empty forms and mockery vile,
Tests and oaths, old Popery's boast,
Form'd one monumental pile.

Then with meek, yet cheerful face,
Index of a soul sincere,
Cloth'd in modesty and grace.
Truth's own votaries drew near.
Some there were of ev'ry name&mdash;
Some belong'd to ev'ry time&mdash;
Some from ev'ry station came&mdash;
Some from ev'ry sect and clime;

High and low, and rich and poor,
Mean and mighty, young and did
Some enrich'd with Learning's store,
Some with minds of humblest mould,
But the whole harmonious throng,
Echoing far o'er hill and dale,
Join'd in one triumphant song,
TRUTH IS GREAT, AND SHALL PREVAIL.
