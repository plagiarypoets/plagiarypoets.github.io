I.
Soft words, when flowing from a mouth so sweet,
How far do ye excel the deftest Air
That ever yet resounded from the seat,
Where the nine Maidens chant their Carols rare.
Thy Words alone, fair Nymph, so piercing are,
That through my simple heart they stricken be;
No Sounds may with their poignancy compare
To strike so deep, or wound so tenderly,
Ne Clio's Song, ne Phoebus choicest minstrelsy.

II.
Why wish to sing?  sure that were covetise!
When as your Charms so forcibly persuade.
Small lack, I ween, have those dead-doing Eyes,
Of luring Song, or thrilling Music's Aid.
Leave that poor Art to him, who sore dismay'd,
Lest you receive his bold praise angrily,
Must strive, as Orpheus, Pluto's wrath allay'd,
To charm the threat'ning vengeance from your Eye,
And tune your soul to his, in kindred Harmony.
