And now, thou gentle shade of rural bard,
Whose lines I oft have ey'd with soft regard,
If humblest efforts ever can thee move
From mourning o'er the relicks of thy love,
Come to my HAPPY VILLAGE, and behold
Thy AUBURN'S self each homely bliss unfold;
See here the sign-post firm, the pastor good,
And every rustic charm as once it stood.
Haste, gentle shade!  on wafting Zephyrs borne,
Forsake thy haunts deserted and forlorn,
Prove the kind guardian of the peaceful scene,
Where all thy long-lost beauties shine serene;
Speed on thy airy flight to BLANCHLAND fair,
And sometimes think of him who call'd thee there;
Approve his essay from thy lofty seat;
And if above our spirits ever meet,
We both shall, happy mortals, bless and sing
Eternal praises to our HEAV'NLY KING.
