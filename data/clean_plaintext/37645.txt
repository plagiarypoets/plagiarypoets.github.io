Unlike the once grave train that's here immur'd,
The jocund Florio found a recent grave;
Not florid health precarious life secur'd,
Nor youths nor blooming virgins tear could save.

Where's that creative fancy's sparkling glee,
Whose rapid sallies shook the circle round,
Till, like the lighting's burst, his repartee
Bad the peal'd roar from festive roofs rebound?

Where's the kind social pow'rs he once possess'd,
That rais'd the heart, and bad the spirits glow;
The gen'rous wish to make all mankind blest,
And feeling heart to lighten ev'ry woe?

What tho' th' enliv'ning bloom of fancy fades,
Th' awak'ning glow, and social sweetness fled;
Beyond Time's weary flight the soul pervades,
And soars to regions sacred to the dead.

This gen'rous hope should fan th' aetherial fire,
This only worth ambition's glorious aim,
To raise the soul above its frail desire,
And slight th' amusive impotence of Fame.
