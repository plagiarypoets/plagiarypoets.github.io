What, Celia, should we blame our Stars, that they
Our Loves or interrupt or separate;
Or cruelty combine their partial Sway,
To make our mutual Joys the less compleat?
Our Stars themselves know Change as well as we,
And sudden Clouds their spangled Glories hide,
Yet soon those Clouds withdraw, and then we see,
Again they triumph and resume their Pride:
The same vicissitude all Nature shares,
Dies and revives, looks gay or gloomy, like the Stars.

Tho' Winter Frosts deform the blest Retreat
Of rural Innocence and artless Love;
And drive the Turtle from his constant Mate,
Alone to wander thro' the leafless Grove;
Yet soon as genial Spring renews the Shade,
Beneath the wonted Bower the Lover tells
His mighty Anquish to the listning Maid,
While she in Blushes all her Flame reveals.
The Turtle mourns his Solitude no more,
But woo's his Mate, and bills as closely as before.

While am'rous THAMES thro' many a winding, wooes
The briny THETIS to his ouzy Bed,
The conscious Goddess owns his faithful Vows,
And in her Bosom folds her dewy Head;
But at the Moon's Command flies far away,
Severe her Laws the rigid Planet keeps,
And the unwilling Lovers must obey,
The Goddess murmurs and the River weeps;
Till at ther gracious Nod they rush amain,
And loose their blending Streams in boundless Joys again.

Then think not, Celia, Pleasure is no more,
Nor of our present hapless Lot complain;
Another Change will our past Joys restore,
And we shall live to meet, and love again.
As well may pious Saints bemoan their Fate,
When they are summon'd to resign their Breath,
And leave the Pleasures of a mortal State,
Th' wander in the dreary Vale of Death:
But oh, blest Change!  when once the Pilgrims prove,
The Musick of the Spheres, and taste SERAPHIC LOVE!
