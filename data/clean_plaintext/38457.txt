Absence, the foe of every fond desire,
Prolongs its stay, and robs my soul of rest;
Yet absence vainly strives to quench the fire,
Almighty love has kindled in my breast.
What can her presence than her absence more?
Absent, my thoughts are fix'd on her alone:
Present, I could but silently adore,
To the sweet maid my passion is unknown:
But whether here she bides or far away,
My heart, soul, thoughts, with her, and her alone must stay.

Rise shades of darkness, rise, and quench the light:
When she's away, no lack of day I find;
More dear to me the sable veil of night,
Her image solely then employs my mind;
No other object then can intervene
To rob my soul of that sublime delight;
When by these eyes the fair one is not seen,
Oh!  what avails to me the use of sight?
She, she alone, should every sense employ,
She, who to every sense can yield the purest joy.
