While we retire from noise of city blades,
O Fl-mm-ng, to gay fields and cooling shades,
Where nature deck'd in all her richest dye,
With pleasing landscapes holds the ling'ring eye,
Permit the muse to chaunt a rural song,
For rural strains to rural scenes belong.

A shepherd youth beneath a beachen shade
Thus sung his griefs, as on his pipe he play'd:
Alack-a-day!  why heaves my beating heart
For one who scorns to cure its am'rous smart,
Who gives for love returns of cool disdain,
And adds not joy to joy, but pain to pain?
What tho' in plants and herbs unmatch'd my skill,
I know whate'er will cure my sheep, or kill.
That boots me little, since alas!  I find
No herb that grows can cure a love-sick mind.
When I from love's corroding cares was free,
By turns I swam the brook, or climb'd the tree:
The first in ev'ry rural sport was I,
And rare did fate the victory a prize deny.
No swain like me could deftly turn the rhyme,
Nor dancing keep so true the measur'd time:
But now, alas!  to no gay sport inclin'd,
I load with sighs alone the passing wind;
Alone I sit inactive all the day,
Nor tune the pipe, nor chaunt the sprightly lay.
Ah!  would the maid I love no more deny,
The tender joy for which alone I sigh!

Look round, my love, how gay the fields appear,
What blooming flow'rs adorn the rising year,
Yet 'ere 'tis long these flow'rs will all decay,
These fields appear as if they ne'er were gay:
Then by the forelock catch insidious Time,
The winter comes, enjoy these "hours of prime."
Scorn not a shepherd, nor his rural sports,
There's more content in cottages than courts.
Tell me what bribe will gain thy wishful heart,
With all my flock to gain that bribe I'd part,
My brindled heifers and my milk-white kine,
I'd freely give, could I but call thee mine:

Alas, fond boy, thy gifts the fair disdains,
In vain the giver of his love complains,
Rouze Colin then, the country's now at arms,
And court fair freedom's never fading charms.
