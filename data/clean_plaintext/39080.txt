Where Midhurst rears her white-wash'd tow'r on high,
Once Mibu call'd, or ancient poets lie,
Two servants there, I heard the pleasing strain,
Both lov'd and loving, talk'd with might and main:
One from the turtle took her name so bright:
William, the pride of swains, whose charming voice
Made the long hall and empty court rejoice.

WILLIAM.
Sweet are the fields, and sweet the crowing cock,
And sweeter still the nap till eight o'clock:
To eat fat mutton's sweet, and drink the while;
But sweeter than them all is Turtle's smile.

TURTLE.
Me too the fields delight, and me the street,
When Midhurst fair invites her youth to meet:
Sweet to forget what we are told to do;
But none of these in half so sweet as you.

WILLIAM.
I serve a master good without pretence,
Of polish'd manners and of polish'd sense,
Whose secret acts the poor of Midhurst own;
Yet would I leave them all, and follow thee alone.

TURTLE.
A beauteous mistress I, of manners mild,
Whom Virtue honours as her favour'd child:
Whose gentle words no venom'd malice bear,
To rob of character the neighb'ring fair.
Ah!  I could stand from morn to dewy eve,
And sing untir'd, nor yet the subject leave.

AMBO.
Yet would we leave them all for love so true,
And like the Turtle live, and like the Turtle woo.
