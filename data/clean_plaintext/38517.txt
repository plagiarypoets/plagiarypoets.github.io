Before ye a' ha'e doon, I'd humbly crave,
To speak twa words or three, amang the lave,
No for mysel, but for an honest Carle,
Wha's seen right mony changes i' the warl',
But is sae blate, down here he durstna come,
Lest, as he said, his fears might ding him dumb;
An' then he's frail, &mdash; sae beg'd me to repeat
His simple thoughts about this fell debate,
He gied me this lang scroll; it's e'en right brown;
I'se let you hear't just as he has't set down.

"Last ouk, our Elspa, wi' some creels o' eggs,
An' three fat eerrocks fas'n'd by the legs,
Gaed down to Embrugh, caft a new bane kame,
An' brought a warl' o' news and clashes hame.
For she's scarce out a day, an' gets a text,
But I'm dung deaf wi' clatter a' the next;
She'll tell a' what she heard frae en' to en',
Her cracks to wives, wives cracks to her again,
Till wi' quo I's, quo she's, an' so's, her skirle
Sets my twa lugs a ringing like a gir'le.

"'Mang ither ferlies whilk my kimmer saw,
Was your prent paper batter't on the wa';
She said she kentna rightly what it meant,
But saw some words o' goud an' poets in't!
This gart me glour, sae aff sets I my lane
To Daniel Reid's, an auld frien' o' my ain,
He gets the news, and tauld me that ye'd hecht
A dawd o' goud, on this same fursday night,
To him wha'd show, in clinking verses drest,
Gin Ramsay's sangs or Ferguson's war best.

"Trouth I was glad to hear ye war sae kind,
As keep our flee-tongu'd Billies in your mind;
An' tho' our Elspa ca'd me mony a gouk,
To think to speak amang saw mony fouk,
I gat my staff, pat on my bonnet braid,
An' best blue breeks that war but fernyear made;
A saxpence too, to let me in bedeen,
An' thir auld spentacles to help my een;
Sae I'm come here, in houps ye'll a' agree,
To hear a frank auld kintra man like me.

"In days whan Dryden sang ilk bonny morn,
An' Sandy Pope began to tune his horn,
Whan chiels round Lon'on chaunted a' fu' thrang,
But poor, cauld Scotlan' sat without a sang;
Droll Will Dunbar frae flyting than was freed,
An' Douglas too, an' Kennedy were dead,
An' nane were left, in hamely cracks to praise
Our ain sweet lasses, or our ain green braes.
Far aff our gentles for their poets flew,
An' scorn'd to own that lallan sangs they knew,
Till Ramsay raise.  O blythsome, hearty days!
Whan Allan tun'd his chaunter on the braes!
Auld Reekie than frae blackest, darkest wa's
To richest rooms resounded his applause,
An' whan the nights were dreary, lang an' dark,
The beasts a' fothert an' the lads frae wark,
The lasses wheels, thrang birring round the ingle,
The ploughman borin wi' his brogs an' lingel,
The herds wires clicking owr the ha'f-wrought hose,
The auld Gudeman's een ha'flins like to close,
The Gentle Shepherd frae the bole was ta'en,
Than sleep I trow was banish'd frae their een,
The cankriest than was kittled up to daffin,
An' sides and chafts maist riven war wi' laughin.

"Sic war the joys his cracks cou'd eith afford,
To Peer an' Ploughman, Barrowman or Lord,
In ilka clauchan wife, man, wean an' callan,
Cracket an' sang frae morn to e'en o' Allan.

"Learn'd fouk that lang in colleges an' schools
Hae sooket learning to the vera hools,
An' think that naething charms the heart sae weel's
Lang cracks o' Gods, Greeks, Paradise, and Deils,
Their pows are cram't sae fu' o' lear an' art,
Plain, simple nature canna reach their heart;
But whare's the rustic, that can, readin', see
Sweet Peggy skiffin ow'r the dewy lee,
Or wishfu' stealing up the sunny howe
To gaze on Pate, laid sleeping on the knowe;
Or hear how Bauldy ventur'd to the deil,
How thrawn auld Carlines skelpit him afiel';
How Jude wi's hawk met Satan i' the moss;
How Skin-flint grain't his pocks o' goud to loss;
How bloody snouts an' bloody beards war gi'en
To smiths and clowns at Christ's kirk on the green;
How twa daft Herds wi' little sense or havings,
Din'd by the road &mdash; on honest Hawkie's leavings,
How Hab maist brak the priest's back wi' a rung;
How deathless Addie died, an' how he sung;
Whae'er can thae (o' mae I needna speak)
Read twenty ow'r at his ain ingle cheek,
An' no fin', something glowan thro' his blood,
That gars his een glowr thro' a siller flood,
May close the beuk, poor coof!  and lift his spoon;
His heart's as hard's the tackets in his shoon.

"Lang saxty year hae white't ow'r this powe,
An' mony a height I've seen, an' mony a howe;
But aye whan Elspa flate, or things gaed wrang,
Next to my pipe was Allie's sleekit sang;
I thought him blyther ilka time I read,
An' mony a time, wi' unco glee I've said,
That ne'er in Scotland wad a chiel appear,
Sae droll, sae hearty, sae confoundet queer,
Sae glibly gabbet or sae bauld again,
I said, I swor't &mdash; but deed I was mistaen.
Up frae auld Reekie Ferguson begoud,
In fell auld phraze that pleases aye the crowd,
To chear their hearts whiles wi' an antrin sang,
Whilk, far an' near, round a' the kintry rang.

"At first I thought the swankie didna ill&mdash;
Again I glowrt to hear him better still.
Bauld, slee and sweet, his lines mair glorious grew,
Glow'd round the heart, and glanc'd the saul out thro';
But whan I saw the freaks o' Hallow-fair,
Brought a' to view as plain as I'd been there,
An' heard, wi' teeth maist chatterin i' my head,
Twa kirk-yard Ghaists rais'd goustly frae the dead,
Daiz'd Sandy greetan for his thriftless wife,
How camscheuch Samy sud been fed in Fife,
Poor Will an' Geordy mourning for their frien',
The Farmer's ingle, an' the cracks at e'en,
My heart cry'd out, while tears war drappan fast,
O Ramsay, Ramsay, art thou beat at last!

"Ae night the lift was skinklan a' wi starns,
I cross'd the burn, an' dauner't thro' the cairns,
Down to auld Andrew Ralston's o' Craig-neuk,
To hear his thoughts, as he had seen the beuk,
(Andrew's a gay droll haun, &mdash; ye'll ablins ken him&mdash;
It maksna, I had hecht some sangs to len' him,)
Aweel, quo' I, as soon's I reck't the hallan,
What think ye now o' our bit Embrugh callan?
'Saf's man,' quo' Andrew, 'yon's an unco chiel!
He surely has some dealings wi' the deil!
There's no a turn that ony o' us can work at,
At hame or yet a' fiel', at kirk or market,
But he describ'st, as paukily an' fell,
As gin he'd been a kintra man himsel'.
Yestreen, I'm sure, beside our auld gudewife,
I never leugh as meikle a' my life,
To read the king's-birth-day's fell hurry burry,
How draigl't Pussey flies about like fury;
Faith, I ken that's a fact. &mdash; The last birth-day,
As I stood glouring up an' down the way,
A dead cat's guts, before I cou'd suspect,
Harl't thro' dirt, cam clash about my neck,
An' while wi' baith my nieves frae 'bout I tok it,
Wi' perfect stink, I thought I wad a bocket.

"'His stories too are tell't sae sleek an' baul';
Ilk oily word rins jinking thro' the saul.
What he describes, before your een ye see't,
As plain an' lively as ye see that peat.

"'It's my opinion, John, that this young fallow,
Excells them a', an' beats auld Allan hallow,
An' shews, at twenty-twa, as great a giftie
For painting just, as Allan did at fifty.'"

You, Mr. President, ken weel yersel,
Better by far than kintra-fouks can tell,
That they wha reach the gleg auld farrant art,
In verse to melt, an' soothe, an' mend the heart;
To raise up joy, or rage, or courage keen,
And gar ilk passion sparkle in our een,
Sic chiels, (whare'er they hae their ha' or hame),
Are true-blue bards, and wordy o' the name.
Sud ane o' thae, by lang experience, man
To spin out tales frae mony a pawky plan,
An set's a laughing at his blauds o' rhyme,
Wi' sangs, aft polish'd by the haun o' time;
And should some stripling, still mair light o' heart,
A livelier humour to his cracks impart:
Wi' careless pencil draw &mdash; yet gar us stare
To see our thoughts, our hearts, our follies drawn,
And nature's sel' fresh starting frae his haun;
Wad mony words, or speeches lang, be needed,
To tell whase rhymes war best &mdash; wha clearest headed?

Sits there within the four wa's o' this house,
Ae chiel o' taste, droll, reprobate or douse,
Whase blessed lugs hae heard young Rob himself,
(Light as the lamb that dances on the dell,)
Lay aff his auld Scots crack wi' pawky glee,
And seen the fire that darted frae his ee?
O let him speak!  O let him try t' impart,
The joys that than gush'd headlang on his heart,
Whan ilka line, and ilka lang-syne glowr
Set faes, an' frien's, and Pantheons in a roar!
Did e'er auld Scotland fin', a nobler pride
Through a' her veins, and glowan bosom glide,
Than when her muse's dear young fav'rite bard,
Wi' her hale strength o' wit, and fancy fir'd,
Raise frae the thrang, and kin'ling at the sound,
Spread mirth, conviction, truth and rapture round?

To set Rob's youth and inexperience by,
His lines are sweeter and his flights mair high.
Allan, I own, may show far mair o' art;
Rob pours at once his raptures on the heart.
The first by labour mans our breast to move;
The last exalts to extasy and love.
In Allan's verse sage sleeness we admire;
In Rob's, the glow of fancy, and of fire,
And genius bauld, that nought but deep distress,
And base neglect, and want, could e'er suppress.

O hard, hard fate! &mdash; but cease, thou friendly tear,
I darna mourn my dear lo'ed Bardie here,
Else I might tell, how his great soul had soar'd,
And nameless ages wonder'd, and ador'd,
Had friends been kind, and had not his young breath,
And rising glory, been eclips'd by death.

But lest owre lang I lengthen out my crack,
An' Epps be wearying for my coming back,
Let ane an' a' here, vote as they incline,
Frae heart and saul Rob Ferguson has mine.
