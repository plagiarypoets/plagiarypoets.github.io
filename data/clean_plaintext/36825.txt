Man is far more inclined to good than evil,
I care not what the learned Doctors say,
About his natural bias to the devil,&mdash;
His natural bias is to good alway:
Pernicious precepts taught from day to day,
And bad example, turn his steps aside;
Even his infant feet are led astray:
Now, is he borne along on passion's tide;
And now, is forward urged by prejudice or pride.

The meteor impulse is his guiding star,
Where Reason's light can scarcely show him right;
He wanders here, and now he wanders there,
As shifts the phantom that deceives his sight,
Seeming to lead to regions of delight,
That in the distance meet his longing eyes:
Sometimes he onward strains with all his might,
To reach the goal, to gain the tempting prize,
And sometimes, heeding nought, in indolence he lies.

Ever the slave of circumstance, his life
Presents a scene of inconsistencies;
His actions and his jugment are at strife,
And not from choice is this at war with these;
He does but follow the severe decrees
Of strong Necessity; or Habit pleads
Observance for her ancient usages;
Or Folly bids him imitate her deeds:&mdash;
Error's misguided child, for thee my bosom bleeds!
