Mute is that tongue which late would squeal so shrill,
Clos'd are those eyes oft to thy safety true;
Unmov'd the limbs which oft so nimbly mov'd,
When the replenish'd trough stood full in view.

The cruel knife has drank thy spouting blood,
And unrelenting pierc'd thy beating heart,
Had laid thee weltering in a crimson flood,
And soon forever, must thy breath depart.

No more thou'lt range the wood, by instinct led,
Or, with thy kindred pigs, the spacious field,
In search of nut or acorn newly shed,
Or root nutritious 'neath the turf conceal'd;

No more with mischief fraught, and nose upheld,
Seek the sly breach in fence or tumbling wall,
Through which to steal, and in the cultur'd field
Lay waste and riot on the lab'rer's toil.

Ah!  little didst thou think, when in the stye
Thy master fed thee with such watchful care,
With corn, potatoes boil'd, and mouldy rye,
Thy life would pay for such delicious fare.

Full many a bard in lofty verse has sung
The praise of heroes and of patriots true,
Of wisdom's sons; and in sweet melting strains
Fond lovers oft the listening maidens woo.

And not alone have themes like these inspir'd
The maddening, sublime, or melting song,
But broken mugs, pipes, cats, and dogs have fir'd
The Muse to sing with pity-waking tongue.

Shall then thy parting breath expire unsung,
Thou swine of varied and sensual worth?
Shall black oblivion enshroud thy fate?
Forbid it Justice stern, forbid it truth.

Thy passing worth, when smoaking on the board
Thou'rt laid; and briskly move the knife and fork;
The gorging epicure shall oft declare,
And all who like fat bacon or good pork.
