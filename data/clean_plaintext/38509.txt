How wretched the Maiden who loves
A Shepherd unworthy her care!
From Fair-one, to Fair-one who roves,
And whose Promise is lighter than Air!

Such the Sorrows which poor PHILLIS knew,
Who COLIN too rashly believ'd;
His aim was to triumph o'er you,
Ah!  PHILLIS, unkindly deceiv'd!&mdash;

Beneath the dark Cypress she lay,
And sigh'd her Complaint to the Wind
"That her COLIN had wander'd away,
And left her despairing behind."

All cold, and stretch'd out in the shade
By the Virgins, pale PHILLIS was found;
And a scroll on her bosom was laid,
Declaring, that Love gave the wound.&mdash;

The Shepherds still speak of her Truth
As they point out her Grave with a sigh,
And upbraid thy inconstancy, Youth!
Who could suffer such Beauty to die.
