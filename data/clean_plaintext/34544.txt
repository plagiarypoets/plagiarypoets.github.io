Full little, blessed Spirit, need'st thou wear
The tinsel trappings of the Poets' train:
Still be it theirs to deck the Tyrant's bier,
And gild with lavish art the bloody reign.
Ah, what th' avail!  the Monarch's sung in vain,
Whose proper actions herald not his praise:
But GEORGE will lustre through the colours plain
Of doubting Chroniclers in future days.
Great King!  be Thy foot guided by his rays;
Inherit all the Honours of his mind:
Let soft-eyed Mercy wait Thy balanc'd ways;
And laurel'd Peace shower olives on mankind.
Be Thy last Sun, in times far distant view'd,
Equally bright, and equally pursu'd.
