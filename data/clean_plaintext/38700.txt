Now to the rosy-finger'd Train of May,
At length the dreary Hours of Winter yield:
No more the Hoar-frost chills the new-born Day,
No more the wild Winds blast the flow'ry Field.

Now from yon Orchard, lovely to the Sight!
A balmy Fragrance breathe the Zephyr's Bland;
While in luxuriant Foliage, proudly dight,
The sacred Fathers of the Forest stand.

Behold yon Pine, that lifts its Silver Head,
Deep in the Bosom of the pathless Glade:
Who now, to wander where its Branches spread,
Will quit the Fragrance of the vernal Shade.

Yet when the blooming Beauties of the Wood,
By Winter chill'd they leafy Glories yield,
Thy Boughs superior to the Storm have stood,
And flourish'd, verdant 'midst the russet Field.

Mindful of this, my votive Hands shall cull
Each Product fair of April's fruitful Show'rs,
From each gay Shrub its blushing Honors pull,
And on thy Branches hang the various Flow'rs.

And here, when Phoebus gilds the rising Day,
I'll often strike with grateful Hand the Lyre;
And thou, 'midst vernal Groves, shalt hear a Lay,
Which Friendship, Faith, and Constancy inspire.
