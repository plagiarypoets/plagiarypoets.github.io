Beautiful infant with thy brow so bright,
And eyes of dewy softness, that dost seem
By the faint blush of day's decaying light,
Like the faint vision of some poet's dream&mdash;
Beautiful infant!  thou art welcome here,
Although my kiss of love is blended with a tear!

A tear of tenderness &mdash; perhaps of wo,
Will mingle with a mother's smile of joy;
And as mine eyes with such soft drops o'erflow,
While gazing on thy beauty, my fair boy!
Sadness and pleasure there by turns I find,
As hope alternate beams, or fear comes o'er my mind.

Sadness &mdash; to think how soon life's brightest ray
By some unfavoring cloud may be o'ercast;
How quickly youth's fair dawn will fade away,
And manhood's ripen'd noon be o'er and past;
And years steal on with eager, hurried pace,
Till the cold frost of age sinks all in his embrace.

Pleasure &mdash; when Fancy whispers thou may'st run
The brilliant race of glory or renown;
That ere thy life's bright circuit shall be done,
Genius may wreathe for thee her laurel crown.
Thus hope will promise in my dreaming ear,
And then the smile of joy outshines the timid tear.

But when I think of broken hearts, and blighted
By the world's scorn, or Fortune's changing wave,
Of talents misapplied, and genius slighted,
Or youthful hopes that find an early grave,
Then pleasure dies within my sinking heart,
And over days to come the tear of grief will start.

Yet, lovely infant; with thy brow so bright,
And eyes of dewy softness, that dost seem
By the faint blush of day's decaying light,
Like the fair vision of some poet's dream;
Yet, lovely infant!  thou art welcome here,
Although my kiss of love is mingled with a tear.
