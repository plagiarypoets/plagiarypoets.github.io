Methought that I did stand upon a tomb&mdash;
And all was silent as the dust beneath,
While feverish thoughts upon my soul would come,
Losing my words in tears:  I thought of death;
And prayed that when my lips gave out the breath,
The friends I loved like life might stay behind:
So, for a little while, my name might eath
Be something dear, &mdash; spoken with voices kind,
Heard with remembering looks, from eyes which tears would blind!

I prayed that I might sink unto my rest,
(O foolish, selfish payer!) before them all;
So I might look my last on those loved best&mdash;
So never would my voice repining call,
And never would my tears impassioned fall
On one familiar face turning to clay!
So would my tune of life be musical,
Albeit abrupt &mdash; like airs the Spaniards play,
Which in the sweetest part, break off, and die away.

Methought I looked around!  the scene was rife
With little vales, green banks, and waters heaving;
And every living thing did joy in life,
And every thing of beauty did seem living&mdash;
Oh, then, life's pulse was at my heart reviving;
And then I knew that it was good to bear
Dispensed woe, that by the spirit's grieving,
It might be weaned from a world so fair!&mdash;
Thus with submissive words mine heart did close its prayer.
