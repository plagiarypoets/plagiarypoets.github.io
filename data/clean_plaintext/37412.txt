Child of the wintry hour!  ah!  doom'd to trust
Thy tender beauties to inclement skies!
First off'ring of the year,
And harbinger of Spring!
Cradl'd in friendly greens, how pensive droops
Thy nodding head!  while in thy bashful eye,
As mournful of thy fate,
Hangs sad a pearly tear.

Companion of Adversity!  like thee,
To dangers rough consign'd, the new-dropt lamb,
With unstain'd fleece and soft,
Presses thy verdant bank.
Alas!  in this bad world, nor Innocence
Secures from biting Slander's pois'nous tooth,
Nor Gentleness itself,
Her virgin sister meek.

The temper mild, that knows not how to frown,
Nor of harsh rule the sceptre how to wield,
Is form'd to sink before
The boist'rous Passions rage.
Alas!  like thee, poor injur'd Flavia bloom'd,
The sweetest bud of unsuspicious youth!
Alas!  like thee, all purity,
Like thee, to storms consign'd.

But ah!  she felt the rude unpitying breath
Of Malice, keener than the wintry winds;
And shrunk beneath the blast
That never, never spares.
Poor early victim of its pow'r, she sunk
Pitied, believ'd, and mourn'd, alas!  to late;
Chill'd by the icy touch
And early foot of Death.

Oft' as thy chaste, thy unassuming face
Shall deck the morning of the nascent year,
This wounded breast shall heave
With pangs of cureless grief:
When painful Mem'ry tells how soon she fell,
And hapless pass'd, like thee, fair spotless flow'r!
Her little life, forlorn,
Amid the wilds of fate.
