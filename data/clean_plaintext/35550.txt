O thou!  for whom my verse has often flow'd
In strains of woe to thy fraternal name,
For whom my bosom with affection glow'd,
While thou wast tenant of thy mortal frame;
For thee that bosom still remains the same,
Tho' many a spring has deck'd, with flow'rs, thy grave,
Time rolls his years; but loses still his aim
T' impair the deep impressions nature gave.
Thine image can each present object brave,
And prove remembrance stronger far than sense.
Fraternal love can never cease to crave
The tender tribute of regret intense.
Tho' hoary age should tell my hundredth year,
Thy name shall still be mention'd with a tear!
