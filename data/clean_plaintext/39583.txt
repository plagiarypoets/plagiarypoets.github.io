Of common-place, the literary water,
Take quantum suff., and, for your chief ingredient,
Some high-born Count's, or wealthy Baron's daughter;
A brace of lovers is, at least, expedient,
And one, by rule, must make the Lady lenient;
Be sure my Lord's a most unnatural father;
A maiden-aunt besides you'll find convenient;
Mix them much mawkish sentiment together,
In every sort of scene, and every kind of weather.

Of parchments, bravos, plots and blood, be lavish;
And let, to prove how fierce the lady's honour,
The hated lover every thing but ravish;
To heap more terrible imbroglios on her,
Let father, aunts, and uncles all disown her;
When plagued enough, to save her, let, by chance,
Some grisly ghost compassion take upon her;
Then fix your scene in Italy or France,
And dub the Monster's birth a Novel or Romance.
