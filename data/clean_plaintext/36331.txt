Mother of Dante and Raffaelle &mdash; ITALY,
Poets will ever love thy skies of calm,
And voice of music, and warm breath of balm,
And glorious forms of grace and majesty!&mdash;
Old Chaucer lov'd thee for Boccaccio's stories&mdash;
Spenser for Tasso's; and Milton trod
Thy viny fields &mdash; Milton, minstrel of God,&mdash;
And loved idolatrously thy olden glories.
As poets have loved thee, do thou love them&mdash;
And chiefly one who wanders now thy land;
Be as the fondest lover unto him;
And shield him from the savage bandit's hand,
As mother would her son; and play the part
That's Roman to a Roman &mdash; soul and heart.
