Oh day deplor'd!  thy melancholy dawn
On scenes of pangful apprehension rose;
And ere thy lengthen'd hours of gloom were gone,
Confirm'd the sad anticipated woes.
On all those joys maternal fondness knows,
Those hopes whose beams on distant raptures play,
Thy course beheld the veil of darkness close,
And quench the last fond gleam of pleasure's ray,
While sunk in death's cold shades a tender victim lay.

And yet, Oh day of joy!  on whose blest morn
Descending angels bore the voice of peace;
Proclaimed on earth the babe of Bethlehem born,
While with "glad tidings" shook the distant breeze,
Born th' imprison'd spirit to release
From Sin's dominion, and from Death's dark sway;
To bid Mortality's deep murmurs cease,
And rend the separating veil away
Which wrapt in superstition's gloom the bright celestial day.

How shall I mingle in the festive throng,
While memory renews distraction's hour?
Or how, exulting, raise the joyful song,
While my soul sinks in sad dejection's pow'r:
Yet though on earth despair's dark prospects lower,
This day celestial light dispels the gloom;
In heavenly vision bids the spirit tower,
And o'er the ruins of the darksome tomb
View scenes of love arise, and undecaying bloom.

Father of boundless mercies!  Oh forgive
The tears which flow on this auspicious day!
Pity the heart where pining sorrows live,
When love and gratitude should swell the lay!
And from thy throne of light, may one blest ray
Of love, and heavenly radiance be given!
To free the weary soul from sorrow's sway,
(On her dark waves too long by tempest driven)
To lead her through a Saviour's love, to peace, &mdash; to Heaven!
