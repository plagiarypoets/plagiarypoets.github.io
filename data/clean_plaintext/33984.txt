Fix'd is the Date of all Things here below,
Relentless Time devours them soon or late:
Ev'n Springs shall fail, and Rivers cease to flow,
And mould'ring Mountains sink with Age's Weight.

In vain that fierce Destroyer to defeat,
Proud Monuments of labour'd Art we raise,
Soon they decay and perish at his Feet,
Born down th' impetuous Stream of rolling Days.

Alas!  must Beauty too be doom'd to fade?
Time is a Tyrant, whom no Charms can move:
Not even thine, LUCINDA, dearest Maid;
Even thine protected, by the God of Love.

Smile on me, fair One, and my Pains asswage!
Thy Charms thro' unborn Ages I'll prolong;
I'll bid them scorn even Time's devouring Rage,
And Bloom for ever in immortal Song.

Serenely smooth the easy Lines shall flow,
Brightly shall shine adorn'd with ev'ry Grace;
But to thy Smiles their Strength and Softness owe,
And steal their Beauties from thy Mind and Face.
