Had his Statira thy fair charms possest,
How few young Ammon's faithlessness would blame,
By such a Queen admir'd, sought, carest,
He had despised the blandishments of fame,
And sunk the victor's in the lover's name.
Fairest!  accept the wishes of a friend,
May never calumny thy worth defame;
May white-rob'd innocence thy steps attend;
May happiness be thine, till life's last scene shall end.
