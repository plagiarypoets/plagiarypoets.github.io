Why, Earwig!  art thou held is disesteem?
Why shrink my nerves when thou approachest near?
Thy powers to injure me but puny seem&mdash;
But thou'rt a creeper &mdash; hence proceeds my fear.
'Tis said, like wriggling Scandal, to the ear
Thou lov'st to work thy dark insidious way,
Desporting thy secret venom there,
To lead the tickled organ's sense astray.
No wonder, then, the feeling, with dismay,
Vile reptile!  thy detested presence shun,
(If such a treacherous thing, as rumours say,
Thou really art) lest they should be undone.
Avaunt! &mdash; for, if I catch thee in my room,
Like the backbiting Flea's shall be thy instant doom.
