While yet in childhood's calm and sinless hour,
Ere doubt and discord's haunts were in my breast,
When thought I my existence was a dower
Of pond'rous worth, and deemed that I was blest,
E'en in those earliest days of infant rest,
My soul was bound by song, as 'twere a spell;
And when my young heart was with care opprest,
The charms of Poesy would all repel;
And now in youth, oh, Song!  I love thee well,
And fain would be of thee a votary.
Though many cares are round thee, some may tell,
And blighted hopes, yet must I bend the knee,
And offer adorations at thy shrine,
Where all is purity, aye, holiness divine.
