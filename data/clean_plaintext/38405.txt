The burial-bell tolls heavily and drear,
The new-dug earth makes known departed breath,
Sound after sound comes murmuring on the ear,
And tells the triumph of devouring death.

The plume-deck'd hearse in funeral pomp comes on;
Coach after coach displays a host of friends,
Who weep, or seem to weep, for him that's gone,
And thus the last sad solemn mockery ends!

The death-bell stops &mdash; and yet another train
A humbler group, in still procession creep,
Whose limbs can scarce the lifeless weight sustain,
For whom no eye, not one, is seen to weep.

The work-house pauper is by all forsook,
His place of quiet is the parish hole;
On his poor corpse no sorrowing mourners look;
For him, no tears of fond remembrance roll.

And yet he once could boast of joy-fraught days,
Of friends who buzz'd like sun-flies round his door;
His feasts, while he had feasts to give, their praise!
And then, like reptiles, then, were seen no more.

His hand was open, and his heart sincere!
To those that wanted he unsparing gave,
Nor thought the locusts, that he priz'd so dear,
Could scowl like demons on the pauper's grave.
