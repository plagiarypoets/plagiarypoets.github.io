Of goodly port, and tall, the lady was,
Fashion'd with dainty care and symmetry;
Her face, I ween, did mortal charms surpass,
A fixed star did blaze in either eye;
Whilst in her hand she held a mirror high,
Symbol of truth; and on her bosom white
Bloomed the Amaranth's purpureal dye,
Whose flow'rs did cast perfumes so rich and bright,
That Armidor nigh swooned with rapturous delight.

And in the middle of this little bower
Two turtles lay, and coo'd upon her breast;
Decking with pretty toil, in many a flow'r,
A secret opening in her azure vest:
For there her heart by cov'ring was not press'd,
Shewing its movements to the observer's view,
And round her brow an evergreen she cast,
Seeming yet wet with dame Aurora's dew;
Still were its leaves unmov'd whatever tempest blew.
