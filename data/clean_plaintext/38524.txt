SIR W. PULTENEY.
An uncouth Savage and uncivill Wight,
Of griesly hue, and foul, ill-favour'd sight;
And in his lap a mass of Coine he told,
And turned upside down, to feed his eye
And covetous desire with his huge treasury;
And round about him lay on every side
Great Hopes of Gold &mdash; that NEVER could be spent!

MR. PITT.
And, like a crane, his neck was long and fine,
With which he swallow'd up excessive feast,
For want whereof poor People oft did pine!
In green Vine-leaves he was right fitly clad&mdash;
For other clothes he could not wear for heat;
Still as he rode he somewhat did eat,
And in his hand did bear a bouzing Cann.
Unfit he was for any wordly thing,
And eke unable once to stir or go;
Not meet to be a Counsel to a King,
Whose mind in Meat and Drink was drowned so.
Full of Disease was his carcass blue,
And a dry Dropsie thro' his flesh did flow!

MR. DUNDAS.
And next to him sate goodly Shamefacedness;
Ne ever durst his eyes from ground upreare&mdash;
Ne ever once did look up from his dress,
As if some blame of evill he did fear,
That in his cheek made Roses oft appear.

GEORGE ROSE.
&mdash;Down hanging his dull head&mdash;
Yet inly being more than seemly sad;
A pair of Pincers in his hand he had
With which he pinched People to the heart.

MR. WILBERFORCE.
Where that Old Woman day and night did pray
Upon her Beades, devoutly penitent;
Nine hundred Pater-nosters every day
And thrice nine hundred Aves she was wont to say!

And, to augment her painful Penance more,
Thrice every week in Ashes she did sit,
And with her loothsome skin rough Sackcloth wore,
And THRICE THREE TIMES did fast from ev'ry Bit.
