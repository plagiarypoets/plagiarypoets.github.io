Mary, the flow of youth is in thy veins,
The roses of thy infancy are bright
And beautiful as Spring's, when from the chains
Of winter bursting, she enthrall the sight.
Loveliness beams around thee, &mdash; a delight
Haunts thee as thine own essence &mdash; and a charm
Dwells in those eyes of circumfusing light,
Radiant as suns, when skies are blue and warm,
When vanished are the clouds, and far off rolls the storm.

Thy heart is as Heaven's temple, when of thoughts
That cast o'er life their image, there is none
But brings thee a new glory from the grots
Of Fancy, than the dreams of Helicon
More pure and more enchanting.  Thou, like one
Of the Celestial Shapes who come and go
On angel messages, dost rest upon
Our love &mdash; with spirit spotless as the snow
Which swathes the' air-piercing Alps, too bright to dwell below.

And but to hear the music of thy lips
Framing to speech thy soul's imaginings,&mdash;
To see thy smile, like light o'er an eclipse,
Illumining thy face, &mdash; to touch the strings,
The pulse of thy delights, when on the wings
Of buoyant hope, though with diminutive feet,
Thy soul to meet my gratulation springs;&mdash;
Oh, this were bliss to me, more bright and sweet
Than seems that glowing line where suns with oceans meet.

But thou to me art but a heavenly Star,
Which yet the seaman views not o'er the main,
Shed its white lustre &mdash; lovely, but afar,
An unfelt joy in an expanse of pain,
Shrined in thine own solitude &mdash; my strain
Though absent, would speak to thee through the veil
Which separates loved existences.  'Tis vain:
The curtains of thy mind &mdash; they are not frail;
I can but breathe a sigh, and bid thy spirit hail.

I can but bid thee hail to this our earth,
The blessed Saviour welcomed forms like thee;
Thou art the shadow of a purer birth,
A type of the inborn Divinity,
Glassed in whose everlasting face, we see
Things as they are not unto others.  Blest
In this thy pilgrim's sojourn mayest thou be,
And Heaven's all-tranquil haven be thy quest,
In Jesus to repose, and lie in Abraham's breast.
