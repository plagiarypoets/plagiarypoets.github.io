What pleasures shall he ever find,
What joys shall ever glad his heart;
Or who shall cure is wounded mind,
If tortured by misfortune's smart;
Who Hymeneal bliss will never prove;
That more than friendship, friendship mix'd with love?

Without or child or tender wife,
To soothe each care, each woe-born sigh,
Lonely he treads the paths of life,
A stranger to affection's tye:
And when from death he meets his final doom,
No mourning wife with tears of love shall wet his tomb.

Tho' fortune, riches, honours, pow'r,
Had giv'n with ev'ry other toy,
Those painted trifles of the hour,
Those gilded nothings sure to cloy:
He dies forgot, his name no son shall bear,
To shew the man so blest once breath'd the vital air.
