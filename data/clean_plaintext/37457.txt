If ought of gentlest note, the Pastoral Lute
May speak, soft Nymph, and not distract thine ear,
As in the moss-grown glade
Thou lay'st thy languid head;

Attend my strain, and may it soothe thy sense,
As when thou hear'st from out th' accustom'd oak
Lone Philomela pour
Her sadly-pleasing song;

Or stretch'd at length on Hybla's thymy banks,
Breathing perfumes, thou hear'st with soul compos'd
The honey'd tribes resound
Their stilly murmuring hum.

Parent of every Muse!  from Nature's charms
(Hid from the vulgar eyes of busy men)
Fancy the veil updraws
To glad thy Votary's sight.

When did the wretch, in vent'rous quest of gain,
E'er see the Naiads, sedgy-crowned tribe,
Spring from the parted wave
And toss their golden hair?

Some listless youth, who rov'd the shores among
To cull the whisp'ring reeds to form his lute,
Their gambol-freaks espy'd,
And heard their Heav'n-strung shell.

Ne'er did the Hunter, prowling for his prey,
Tripping in mantle green, the Dryad train,
Or of th' all-hallow'd wood
Th' aerial Genius, meet:

No; 'twas some lover, in the shade reclin'd
Who first o'erheard them singing to his pipe,
And with admiring eyes
Beheld them dance around.

Scap'd from the busy world's tumultuous din,
Young Maro first, beneath the beechen shade,
"Thy genial influence own'd,"
And charm'd the Mantuan plains.

Me too, retir'd with thee, as oft I wont,
Gay Fancy visits, and before me brings,
Full on my wond'ring sense,
The fair Aurelia's charms;

Gives me to feel the influence of her eyes;
To taste the raptures of her heavenly smiles;
To press her beauteous lips,
"Celestial rosy red."

For this thy boon thy Votary's hand shall rear
And odorous couch, with every flower combin'd
That loveliest Eve prepar'd
To deck her nuptial bed.

Here as thou liest, with heav'nly fragrance join'd,
The whisp'ring Zephyrs on their balmy wings
My annual praise shall bear
To lull thy list'ning ear.
