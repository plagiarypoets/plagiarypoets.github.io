You sacred offspring of the thundring Jove
who doe Inhabit the Heliconian Grove;
And Fork'd parnassus; from whose mouthes divine
drops Eloquence most pure and most refine
Infuse into me some Heroick streams
Which doe proceed from your more purer beams,
Into me Suada's marrow do Instill
That from my lugent and deepe mourning Quill
I may proclaime the praises great of one
In Galens Crew inferior unto none
But who can his Encomiums declare
Call Spensers Ghost Ben Johnstons, Couleys rare?
Poetick Hero's of the former dayes.
Yea Drydens Orrerie &mdash; of this present age,
and others who doe crown the famous stage.
These Divin mortals be the only men
who can his vertues celebrate with pen. . . .
