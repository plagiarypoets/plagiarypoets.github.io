'Tis sweet employ, with copying hand to trace
The scene where happy childhood pass'd away:
My house belov'd &mdash; secluded, peaceful place!
Where ev'ry heart was innocent and gay,
Free from restraint, command, and custom's sway;
Permitted each its own pursuit to choose;
Amongst romantic solitudes to stray,
Touch music's chord, th' absorbing page peruse,
Or, in abstraction lone, and tender fancy muse.

Such were th' employments of my earliest hours;
Thus did life's opening current softly flow
Through banks of verdure, beauty, shades and flow'rs&mdash;
While heaven's pure tint reflected shone below.
Yes!  here Devotion's beam first learn'd to glow;
Here virtue's sentiments became imprest:
Oh!  scenes beloved!  seclusions sweet!  ye know
What grand ideas, what emotions blest,
Have elevated, charm'd, inspir'd my raptur'd breast!

Enchanting Nature!  beauty all divine!
In whose fair face perfection's features blend;
Where ev'ry type of love and wisdom shine&mdash;
Ah!  thou wert then my sister and my friend.
From thee, no thought removing could I send;
For in thy converse, and thy looks so kind,
Did joy or sorrow on my heart attend,
Alike in both, I still was wont to find
The sympathizing charm that sooth'd and bless'd my mind.

Now from these fairy haunts afar remov'd,
And to their visions wild long bade adieu,
Do I regret a period so belov'd,
And sadly wish its transports to renew?
No &mdash; I contemplate them with grateful view;
But other blessings dear are now supplied;
And while devoted to affection true,
And in improvement's course my moments glide,
Content, and peace, and hope, within my heart reside!
