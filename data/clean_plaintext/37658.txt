The muse records the memorable rage
That mortal bosoms fill'd with hostile hate,
The Bucket's fatal round shall fill my page,
Pandora's box to the Petronian state,
With wild Gemenian match'd in wild debate.
O Phoebus!  give me on the gale to rise,
And soaring, to survey the work of fate;
Or, if Meonian wings my lot denies,
By my long sleeves at least suspend me in the skies.
