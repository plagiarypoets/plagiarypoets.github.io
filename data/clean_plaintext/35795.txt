Sweet harp of Spenser, on thy magic song
By silvery Avon musing as I lie,
Whether thou lead'st my willing soul along
The rosy bowers and vales of Arcady,
Or swellst the verse to Rosalinda high,
And hailst the power of Love's almighty spell,
Or bidst the note of mournful sorrow fly
O'er the cold pillow of thine Astrophel,
How on thy sound my spirit loves to dwell,
And hear thee thus thy varied music raise;
Sweet harp!  what bard in these degenerate days
Like thee the joys of fairy land shall tell;
So wake at Beauty's shrine the warbling lay,
And lead the captive soul in willing chains away.
