Most favour'd Lord, in whose pure intellect,
The temple of divine humanity,
Th' eternal Muses triumph, with affect
Of all that lives above the lamping sky;
With what enlarged pinion shall I fly,
T' attain the glory of this argument,
That in thy rising wisdom can descry
The star that shall enlight our firmament?
And there shall reign, amidst the sweet consent
Of all, that honour magnaminity,
And in the rule of virtue find content:
Meanwhile, 'till that auspicious time shall be,
This portraiture of worth, by Sidney penn'd,
To thy most faultless judgment I commend.
