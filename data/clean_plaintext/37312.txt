Most "reverend" parson!  know, my lazy muse,
That oft, in former days, so deftly sung,
Hath not the heart, in these times, to refuse
A lay to thee, O worthiest priest, among
Those worthy priests, who Orthodoxy's horn
So valorously blow, each noon, and night, and morn.

There was a time &mdash; Heaven send the time again&mdash;
When Faith had champions zealous for the fight;
When G****** thumped the cushion not in vain,
And C**** fulminated gospel spite:
When eloquence and logick show'd their force,
And pity her power, in generous Dr. M****.

Now distant far is G******; HE is far
Who pitch'd, so bravely, battle with a woman;
C***** grown quiet, resteth him from war,
Waged, for a while, with ardour scarcely human.
The church hath peace, nor feareth dire alarms;
And, save the "Reverend James," no ghostly knight's in arms.

Elate with pride, and curs'd with moral works,
Beneath the wrath of Heav'n poor Boston lay;
Pleasing her sinful lusts, with sundry quirks
Of liberal love &mdash; for sufferers far away;
And whilst she felt for others' woes and needs,
(O horrid!) deem'd that God was pleas'd with gen'rous deeds!

Thou camest hither! &mdash; the destroying flame
Had laid the vineyard of thy labours low&mdash;
Not that thou wantedst honour, cash, or fame,
Such gear thou never covetest &mdash; O no.
Hither thou camest &mdash; for, no doubt, the Lord
Thus spake &mdash; Go, S*****, preach &mdash; to hereticks, the word!

Well hast thou minded the divine command!
Most modest Parson!  thou hast acted well;
And yet 'tis hard that folks at Newfoundland,
Losing thy sermons, all must gang to hell!
But what are they, so few, so poor?  what they?
Bostonians, though so vile, still make a shift &mdash; to pay.

As out of Sodom budg'd the holy Lot,
With his chaste daughters and his luckless wife;
Leaving the Sodomites to go &mdash; to poet,
Right glad the patriarch to save his life:&mdash;
So thou, most Reverend seer!  didst soon make track,
And on the scattered flock, disdainest to look back.

Arrived amongst us &mdash; sinners that we are!
What honied sermons dost thou deign to preach!
Blasting our righteous works, and levying war
'Gainst Unitarians, who false doctrines teach;
And proving to us, by clear demonstration,
That as we all deserve &mdash; so we shall "get" damnation.

O, "reverend" parson!  "reverend" parson O!
Words insufficient are to speak thy praise.
Millions of non-elect, in endless wo,
Shall oft remember thee, and eke the days
When, from the spire in Essex-Street, did swell
The notes of thy most sweet and orthodox church bell!

Long from thy desk may sermons hot be heard,
While contribution boxes glide around;
There may the thunders of a "preached word,"
Shavers of notes and godless dames astound;
And may th' elected few still grow in peace,
Tho' Common Sense her nose turn up at priest and place.

Revivals on revivals &mdash; may they spread,
From Newfoundland to farthest Hindu shores,
Till we shall learn (each opposition dead)
That Heathens all have BRASS-PLATES on their doors;
Which plates, aforesaid, neat shall look, and shine,
Like the illustrious Reverend's &mdash; "J**** S*****."
