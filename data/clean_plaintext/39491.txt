Offspring of Venus, power supreme!
Thou tyrant of the human breast!
Whose feather'd darts, in wild extreme,
To misery consign the best.
Once in thy silken flowery chain,
'Twas sweet content, unmix'd with pain;
No tortur'd slaves were heard to groan,
Nor plaintive sounds of woe &mdash; but murmuring sighs alone.

Virtue, Jove's darling child, by fate
Ordain'd o'er favour'd man to reign,
And thou, her happy chosen mate;
Till vice appear'd, true passion's bane,
Seduc'd from virtue's gentle sway,
See lawless love to vice a prey,
Whose favours to the good appears
Misery, compar'd with virtue's very tears.

Dejected virtue quits the plain,
With ev'ry soft attractive grace,
Which erst compos'd her sportive train;
Sweet modesty, with blushing face,
And sacred truth, celestial maid,
And innocence in white array'd,
Bright honour in transparent vest,
And wisdom marching grave &mdash; now in sable drest.

Specious deceit, with aspect bland,
Tempts thee to distant roseat bow'rs,
By fiction rais'd with artful hand,
To deck vain misery with flow'rs,
Lo!  to fill up thy hideous train,
Revenge assuming honour's mein,
Envy and thoughtless vanity,
Remorse, despair, wild rage and black hypocrisy.

Thou sought the rose, but feel'st the thorn,
Th' illusions gradually dissolve;
Thy lab'ring breast, with anguish torn,
Virtue's lost charms and woes revolve;
Hope cries, "thy heavenly queen regain,
Sue her return, nor sue in vain."
Instant she comes with chasten'd joy,
Mild pity, soft content, and sweet tranquility.

Oh!  Cupid, may this matchless dame,
With gentle hand thy fateful dart,
Temper'd in Hymen's sacred flame,
Speed to my unresisting heart,
(Not wounded by the hand obscene
Of vice &mdash; or folly light and vain)
So shall thy suppliant ever prove
Through life the vot'ry true of virtuous love.
