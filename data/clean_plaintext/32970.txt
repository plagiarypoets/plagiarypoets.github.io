The silver Moone, Diana Virgine bright,
On mortall creatours powred her moystening light,
Wherwith she doth adorne the Sable nighte,
Whose sleepinge mantle dimms the peircinge sight;
Which gladsome shine she takes abundantlie
From her beloved spowse, who favourablie
Doth spredd his goulden beames most liberallie
On that faire Phebee full of curtesie.
Thus, like the liberall moone, wee should bestowe
The bennefitts which from highe Jove doe flowe
Unto us mortall creatures here belowe,
Upon our neighbours, whome wee needie knowe,
For soe the beneficiall heavens doe teach us by their kynde,
Whose comfortable vertues, wee doe by their influence finde.
