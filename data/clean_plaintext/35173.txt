For me &mdash; what various tasks demand my care!
What pleasing toil, what sweet solicitude!
Each tender plant requires its separate share,
For while the labourer sleeps, the soil grows rude:
More shade or genial warmth must be supplied,
More foresight lent to guard, more gentleness to guide.

More firm resolve to check the wild desire,
More skill to guide it to its proper end;
When modest merit wishes to retire,
More prudent warmth to flatter and commend;
More self-command, more watchings, broken sleep,
More care for worldly things, yet seem to hold them cheap.

Dear, lovely babes, that bring this weight of care,
Sweet cares!  that bind ye closer to my heart,
A heart more proud your filial loves to share
Than all that ease and affluence could impart,
O meekly bend to my indulgent reign,
Which asks no tyrant's nod, no mind-subduing chain.
