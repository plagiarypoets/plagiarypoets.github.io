Spirit of high-born CHIVALRY, descend,
And listen with averted face,
Whilst I relate the dire Disgrace
That erst befel thy highly-favour'd Friend!

And yet it grieves me to unfold
A scene unknown in days of old,
When first thy Standard thro' the Land
Was born by ARTHUR'S gallant band;
For who in numbers meet could write
That thy far-fam'd, thy chosen Knight,
Could on his spacious staircase stand,
With Constables on either hand,
And there, in accents harsh and rough,
The brightest Beauties of the Land rebuff,
And drive them from his hospitable roof!

Aghast the trembling Females stood&mdash;
All but one Dame of higher blood,
Who, rais'd by spirits not her own,
And indignation, to a proper tone,
Long without flinching all his wrath withstood!
Yet SHE at length was forc'd to yield&mdash;
And quit with ling'ring looks the long-contested field!

Oh, how unlike himself the Hero stood&mdash;
Oh, how unlike himself, in happier mood,
When rumours came from Ireland's hapless shore
That Rebel Sons had stain'd her fields with gore!&mdash;
Then, fierce in arms, exclaim'd th' indignant Chief
"I fly, IERNE, to thy prompt relief;
I burn in Glory's cause my zeal to prove,
And earn fresh Laurels from IERNE'S love!"
With silent joy IERNE'S bosom beat&mdash;
The Rebels trembled in their last retreat!

But, ah, some Spell arrests him in the way,
Some idle rumour still creates delay;
'Till, when at last he reach'd HIBERNIA'S coast,
Threat'ning dire vengeance 'gainst the Rebel Host,
The rescued Maid thus greets him &mdash; "Gallant Son,
You're come a day too late: &mdash; the Battle's won."
SPIRIT of high-born CHIVALRY, descend,
And, if thou canst, thy recreant Knight defend!
