O Spring, relenting maid!  appear,
Unbind again the frozen ground,
In beauty deck the smiling year,
And scatter vernal roses round.
O come!  and with thy radiant hand
In purple paint the western sky;
O come!  and let thy chearful band
Remove th' obstructing clouds, and bid pale Winter fly.

By wanton Zephyrs fann'd, the rose
In pride surveys its opening bloom;
The violets every charm disclose,
And fill the air with rich perfume:
All nature is with beauty crown'd,
The trees resume their varied hues,
The richest verdure dyes the ground,
And every charm appears, to court the rural Muse.

O thou!  by whose divine command
Each low'ring tempest left our isle,
Thy blessings deal with liberal hand,
And bid thy toiling servants smile:
Let Winter turn his gloomy car,
And yield to Spring's delightful sway,
Fly with his shivering train afar,
Nor with tempestuous clouds deform the rosy May.

Unclouded in the azure sky,
Let the bright sun his orb display,
Each storm and threat'ning blast defy,
And chear us with his genial ray.
Let blooming Spring unrival'd reign,
An earnest of the grateful store
Which Autumn sheds on every plain,
And man thy praise shall sing, and thy great power adore.
