The Theme in other Works for every Part,
Supplies Materials to the Builder's Art:
To build from Matter is sublimely great,
But Gods and Poets only can create;
And such are you;  Their Privilege you claim
To show your Wonders, but conceal your Name.

Like some establish'd King, without controul,
You take a general Progress thro' the Soul;
Survey each Part, examine every Side,
Where she's secure, and where unfortify'd.
In faithful Lines her History declare,
And trace the Causes of her Civil War;
Your Pen no partial Prejudices sway,
But Truth decides, and Virtue wins the Day.

Thro' what gay Fields and flow'ry Scenes we pass,
Where Fancy sports, and Fiction leads the Chace?
Where Life, as thro' her various Acts she tends,
Like other Comedies in Marriage ends.

What Muse but yours so justly could display
Th' embattled Passions marshal'd in array?
Bid the rang'd Appetites in Order move,
Give Lust a Figure, and a Shape to Love?
To airy Notions solid Forms dispense,
And make our Thoughts the Images of Sense?
Discover all the Rational Machine,
And show the Movements, Springs, and Wheels within?

But Hymen waves his Torch, all Discords cease;
All parly, drop their Arms, and sue for Peace.
Soon as the Signal flames, they quit the Fight,
For All at first but differ'd to unite.
From every Part the Lines in Order move,
And sweetly center in the Point of Love.

Let Blockheads to the musty Schools repair,
And poach for Morals and the Passions there,
Where Virtue, like a Dwarf in Giant's Arms,
Cumber'd with Words, and manacled in Terms,
Serves to amuse the Philosophick Fool,
By Method dry, and Regularly Dull.
Who sees thy Lines so visibly express
The Soul herself in such a pleasing Dress;
May from thy Labours be convinc'd and taught,
How Spenser would have Sung, and Plato Thought.
