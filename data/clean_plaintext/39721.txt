Take a small cot, or rural cell,
And in it let young Damon dwell;
With youthful Thyrsis; happy pair,
Free from all noises, or worldly care.
Let Thyrsis be young Damon's theme;
And don't forget the purling stream;
For that will serve upon a time,
To make a sim'le, or a rhime.
Next you must have a cypress shade,
That seems for weeping lovers made:
Then let young Damon mournful tell,
How doleful seem'd the parting knell
Of Corydon, the happiest swain,
That sung, or danc'd, or trip'd the plain.
Or you may take some other name,
'Twill serve your purpose just the same:
So as, 'twill run off smooth in verse,
When you've occasion to rehearse
Their noble virtues, wit, and sense;
Or penetration, how immense!
Next blast an aged oak or two,
Where Corydon was wont to go;
Be sure and wither too the flow'rs;
The well known walks, the shady bow'rs.
Then for to season well your piece,
And give the whole a proper grace;
"Say, oft at eve my careless limbs I throw,"
On flow'ry banks, to vent my strains of woe.
