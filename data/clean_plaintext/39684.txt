Ah, Damon, dear shepherd, adieu!
By love and first nature allied,
Together in fondness we grew;
Ah, would we together had died!
For thy faith which resembled my own,
For thy soul which was spotless and true,
For the joys we together have known,
Ah, Damon, dear shepherd, adieu!

What bliss can hereafter be mine!
Whomever engaging I see,
To his friendship I ne'er can incline,
For fear I should mourn him, like thee.
Tho' the Muses should crown me with art,
Tho' honour and fortune should join;
Since thou art denied to my heart,
What bliss can hereafter be mine?

Ah, Damon, dear shepherd, farewell!
Thy grave with sad offers I'll bind;
Tho' no more in one cottage we dwell,
I can keep thee for ever in mind:
Each morning I'll visit alone,
His ashes who lov'd me so well,
And murmur each eve o'er his stone,
"Ah, Damon, dear shepherd, farewell!"
