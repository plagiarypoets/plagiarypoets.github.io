Renowned Spencer lye a thought more nye
To learned Chaucer, and rare Beaumond lye
A little neerer Spenser, to make roome
For Shakespeare in your threefold, fowerfold Tombe.
To lodge all fowre in one bed make a shift
Untill Doomesdaye, for hardly will a sift
Betwixt this day and that by Fate by slayne,
For whom your Curtaines may be drawn againe.
If your precedency in death doth barre
A fourth place in your sacred sepulcher,
Under this carved marble of thine owne,
Sleepe, rare Tragedian, Shakespeare sleep alone;
Thy unmolested peace, unshared Cave,
Possesse as Lord, not Tenant, of the Grave,
That unto us and others it may be
Honor hereafter to be layde by thee.
