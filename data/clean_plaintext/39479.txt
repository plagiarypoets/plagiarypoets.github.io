"Haste, dearest maid, and view a sight indeed.
Haste, and behold upon the verdant plains,
Where Love, exulting, sports,
And waves his purple wings.

"What wills the archer?  Neither dart nor bow
Are near him laid; nought, save a silken snare,
Which the sly urchin spreads
Beneath a myrtle's shade:&mdash;

"Stay, thoughtless child; nor, like the cruel elves
By mortals called school-boys, joy in woe.
Oh!  spare the orphan's cries,
The widow'd mother's tears!

"Stay, and contemplate how they jocund rove,
As rising fancy bids them.  Do not go
And act a daemon's part,
Delighting to destroy.&mdash;

"He recks me not, my Emma; see, the snare
Enfolds the fluttering warblers; Cupid springs,
With rapture in his eyes,
Triumphant on the prey.

"Stay yet, infuriate boy, thy venturous hand!
In pity melt, and set the captives free;
For  Venus, sure, would weep
To view a deed so rude.

"Though slender threads around thy pretty legs
Thou sportive bindest, swiftly let them fly:
Thanks!  gentle Cupid, thanks!
For this thy tender boon.

"But sure the bonds which round them thou hast thrown
Will much impede the rovers in their flight?&mdash;
Ah!  no.  For see, each thread
Around a favourite twines;

"And the enamor'd pairs seek Hymen's aid.
The rosy god descends, and from his plumes
Sheds happiness and peace
O'er all the festive scene."

Alas!  poor Edwin!  As thou showd'st the fair
The thrilling transports which from Cupid spring,
How didst thou sigh, to think
That Fortune was thy foe!
