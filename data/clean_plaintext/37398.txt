GIBBIE, ARCHIE, AND WILLIE.

WILLIE.
Gibbie, Sin a' the Hirstle's fled the Field,
Tag, Rag, and Bobtail Curin in the Beild:
For wha can bide sick blattering Blasts of Rain,
Makes a' the Yerd a'e Dub and rots the Grain.
Among thick Boutrie Benches, let us hide,
Till Sunnie Blink shines upon yon Brae side.
Bite-well, will watch the Fald, the King of Dogs
Least ony ill befa' the silly Hogs.

GIBBIE.
Will let's scoure aff, and Bicker there wi Haist,
Black Clouds of Rain are bursting in the Wast.
Whilk of us twa wad bonnie Mausie get,
Were she for to be win thro' speed of Fit.
Like Makin I'd speel Hills, tho' 'twere my Death,
Now Willie let's ly down and take our Breath;
Nature's all wrang, was e're sick Warld seen,
Dazies are nirl'd and scaded on the Green.
Sad were the drierie Sights, made Herds all mourn,
When Ewes and Lambs, came tumbling down the Burn.
Nae Mow's it is, when sik odd things faes out,

WILLIE.
Stap, stap, hark, hark, I hear an unka Shout.

&mdash;GIBBIE.
Willie gae see&mdash;

WILLIE.
&mdash;Na Gibbie let's ga baith;
Pan, keep dear Francie and our Flocks frae Skaith,
In Gloumin of last Night I saw his Wrath;
Fairies, fetch ay sik Sights before folks Death.

GIBBIE.
'Tis Archie's Voice on mournfull Horn doth bla,
His tater'd Hair amang his een doth fa,
His Face disjaked like, doth fright us a.
Archie, ye've News will make our Hearts full sare,

ARCHIE.
Dear Francie's gane.&mdash;

WILLIE.
&mdash;Stap, Archie speak nae mare;

ARCHIE.
Gan to the greedie Grave where glouring Guests,
Wi Saucer een Skif, o're the drearie Waists.
See how Tod-lawrie's gane to fleg the Fald,
And o're the Dyke pows Gimmers by the Spauld.
Whilst Bite-well hirples, lame of Limb and Lith,
And dare not bark nor bite, nor shaw his Teeth,
Scrog Bushes drap their Barks, and shake their Leaves,
And all the Birds are dumb like common Thieves.
Behind mirk Clouds, ald Phoebus sneaks his Head,
Herds break their Pipes and Clubs since Francie's dead.
Stirks take the Sturdie, and whirle like a Wheel,
Cows brake their Tether, dance a threesome Reel,
Foals frightened, leaves their awn Mammas that bore them.
Herds stare as if the Lift wou'd fa and smore them.
I can'nae say nae mare, my Heart's sae sick,
Gibbie, ye loo'd him well, fa to and speak.

GIBBIE.
I never ken't his Maik, nor never will,
He spake sae well, na Body cou'd be dull.
His Words were sweeter than the Reem of Milk,
Or Hinny Kaims, and safter nor the Silk.
Aft did we to the Birlie Court repare,
And lean'd upon our Kents with Heads all bare.
Hard him speak Words suck't Laverocks frae the Aire.
Dumb were the Mavis and the Nightingale,
And flicker't round his Head to hear his Tale.
When others spake 'twas like a Collies bark,
But Francie gabbed, like a learn'd Clerk.
O!  But his Face shin'd fairer than the Moon,
Was ay good Natur'd, and had cliver Parts,
Francie had ay the Yelk of all our Hearts.
His Words dropt frae him like the falling Streams,
Or Bride and Bridegroom telling Midnight Dreams.
Not Fouller chanting to trapan the Birds,
Was half so ravishing as Francie's Words.
Lovely without, within an Angels Mind,
Humble as Oziers, bending with the Wind.
Mair honest Man, ne're brake the Warld's Bread,
Truth in his Heart, and learning in his Head;
Ay dealing Alms among the Folk in Need.
A plainer Man ne're handled Sheepherd's Crook,
A better Scholler never read a Book.
Nae wonder a the Folk make sik a Mane,
And brake their Heart to think that Francie's gane.
Roses and Laurells on his Grave we'll plant,
And kiss the Ground where lyes inter'd the Saint.

EPITAPH.
Know Passanger, here sleeps the Dust,
Of one was learn'd wise and Just,
A Friend to Peace, a Foe to Strife,
Holy and Harmless all his Life.
All did lament when he expir'd,
By GOD belov'd, by Men admir'd.
