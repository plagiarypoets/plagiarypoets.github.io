Hence!  false, designing cheat, from garret vile,
Or murky cellar sprung!  thy spurious birth
And mix'd embrace thy pallid hue proclaims.
Think'st thou 'mongst those of pure and gen'rous stamp
To pass unknown, and by dissembling face
And mimic form to gull me credulous?
I mark'd thee 'midst thy betters, and with eye
Distinguishing arrested thy deceit;
Dar'st thou confront the envied worth thou ap'st
Confess'd to open day?  Come forth to view;
Naught will avail thy name and face assum'd,
And regal head with George's laurel bound:
Thy telltale paleness speaks thee counterfeit.
Lives there a beggar wretch with hunger prest
Would take thee offer'd?  thou art known so well
The honest tradesman will not sell thee wares.
The gawky clown too late, alas!  has found
He took a sharper, when he harbour'd you.
I've got thee safe; no more expect to thrive
By cheating innocence; in durance firm
I'll fix thee, to deter thy bastard race.
Thus many a harvest, by deceit and fraud,
The cunning juggler thrives; till by success
He grows less cautious, nor to weedling maids
By promis'd sweethearts, he his art confines:
But in ill fated hour attempts to trick
More knowing townsmen; they, averse to frauds,
Or take his greasy galligaskins down,
And birchen smart inflict; or shut in cage,
To curse his fortune, and atone his crimes.
