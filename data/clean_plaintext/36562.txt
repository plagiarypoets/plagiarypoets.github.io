O Greece!  thou land of science, arts, and arms,
In thee the Muse in primeval days
With Pindar rose &mdash; and Sappho's fond alarms
Taught Love to pity in her melting lays.
In thee Anacreon's never-dying bays
'Mid roses 'twin'd, first charm'd the sight
With Poesy's sweet bewitching rays,
Illumining fam'd Parnassia's height!
Ill-fated Greece!  the Muses weep thy flight;
The bloody Turk now stains thy hallow'd soil.
Rise, British Christians &mdash; protect the right
Of suffering freedom in Scio's Isle.
Expel the crescent &mdash; set the captive free!
And plant the cross of pure Christianity!
