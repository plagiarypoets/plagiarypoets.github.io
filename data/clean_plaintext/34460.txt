O say!  where bloom those time-surviving groves
Where ancient bards first sung their sacred loves:
Those sadly-solemn bowers, ye Muses!  say,
Where once the melancholy Cowley lay?
When long perplex'd with Life's deluding snares,
Her flattering pleasures, and her fruitless cares;
Obscure he fled to sylvan shades alone,
And left mankind, to be for ever known.

Such were the scenes where Spenser once retired,
When great Eliza's fame the Muse inspir'd;
When Gloriana led her poet's dreams
O'er flow'ry meadows, and by murm'ring streams.

Immortal bards!  whose death-contemning lays
Shall shine, distinguish'd with eternal praise.
Knew my poor Muse like these to soar sublime,
And spurn the ruins of insulting Time,
Where'er I stray:  where blooming Flora leads,
O'er sunny mountains, and through purple meads;
Or careless in the sylvan covert laid,
Where falling rills amuse the mournful shade,
Ye, rural fields, should still resound my lay,
And thou, fair Studley!  smile for ever gay.
