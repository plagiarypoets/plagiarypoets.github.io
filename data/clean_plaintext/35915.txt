My books must find a resting-place, for they
Can cheer my dreams by night, my thoughts by day.
Let Shakespeare, Milton, Spenser, and the rest,
Who glad the fancy and instruct the breast,
Lie on my table, negligently free,
To charm my friends, or yield their worth to me:
Not with gilt leaves, and letter'd backs, arrang'd,
On some high shelf, and ne'er disturb'd, nor chang'd;
Plac'd there as size demands, or fancy rules,
A prey to dullness, worms, and dust, and fools.
Oh!  there let Byron give my mind delight,
And tell his Eastern narratives at night;&mdash;
His mind, which ever soars on Fancy's wings,
Is quite as glowing as the clime he sings.
Let Campbell lead his Hope within my bowers,&mdash;
And Wordsworth's genius illustrate my flowers;
Though he may yet, in some great hour, resign
The simple violet and celandine,&mdash;
He may with bolder finger sweep the lyre,
and give to after-times a song of fire.
Southey shall bring his "wild and wond'rous lays;"
And sad Alcaeus paint primaeval days.
With Moore o'er Erin's valour I'll rejoice,
And hear again, in him, Anacreon's voice;&mdash;
Learn from his muse what glowing pleasures lie,
O'er the flush'd cheek, and in the sparkling eye.
Scott may recite his tales of yore, and touch
The harp of Scotland, which I love so much.
Rogers &mdash; I'll not forget thee: &mdash; oh!  'twere hard
If Memory should omit her sweetest bard.
Crabbe too may not refuse me, to impart
His pure, bold excellence to mend the heart:&mdash;
And though the last, yet not admir'd the least,
Hunt shall describe to me a Poet's Feast.
Oh!  in the days when life and love are young,
'Tis sweet to cherish what the bards have sung;&mdash;
Their lays of glory, ever grand and great,
Can still inspire the mind to emulate;&mdash;
Their softer songs steal sweetly on the ear,
And wake those feelings which are held so dear,&mdash;
The heart will sympathize o'er woes long past,
If melody but bid their memories last. . . .
