Two hundred years the circling World has roll'd,
I' th' endless Ocean of enlighten'd space,
Her pure allotted path, from earthly mould
Since thy great mind fled up to heav'nly grace;
Disdaining this low stage, and empire base,
Unliken'd Spenser; in her perfect flight
Achieving with brave toil her native place,
And greedy hope of Angelick delight:
Yet could not Time, with his unceasing might,
Most patient, but most fearful enemy,
So aught 'gainst thee, but throw some little slight
Upon thy Verse, vow'd to Eternity:
Todd saw the wrong, then clear'd with golden pen
The faultless charter, to th' applause of men!
