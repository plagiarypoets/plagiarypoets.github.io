&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Then Memory brought the thousand charms in view
Of days too little prized, to wake no more;
And all the forms in faery colours drew
Of Love, and Hope, and Joy, that reigned of yore;
Nor aught of sweetest ornament forbore;&mdash;
Then rushed the tide of present misery,
And all Imagination's cherished store
Resistless whelmed; at once the vernal sky
Was wrapt in darkest clouds, and tempests wild and high.

Night fell upon the woods, and heavily
Reposed upon the copse the vapours gray;
While all the air was filled most soothingly
With balmy odours from the wildwood spray;
Night fell, and all was peace; but WALLACE lay
Alone upon the heath, and fever's fire
And wild delirium on his frame did prey;
While wandering witch-notes of the feathered choir,
Not joy, but fiercer thrills of anguish did inspire.

"O God, who rul'st on high" &mdash; the unfinished prayer
Was checked by the o'erwhelming weight of woe,
And died in fearful accents of despair;
From the high rock he marks the abyss below
In double darkness wrapt, and hears the flow
Of the swift currents echoing far remote;
And sudden with awakening rapture's glow
Hails with delight the soul-enchanting thought,
Death yet is in his power &mdash; the blissful calm he sought.

Blame not, ye pious dull unthinking crew,
Who know not the dominion of despair;
Blame not the anguish which ye never knew,
Who know not Virtue's genuine glory fair,
Who know not those ecstatic sweets to share
That Nature gives and Genius wild and high;
Blame not the lonely soul that thus could dare
The bold adventurous fearful change to try,
And leave at once a world of pain and misery.

O soul!  what art thou when the magic bands
Of bright Imagination are untied?&mdash;
A wandering exile on unfriendly strands,
With nought but sin and woe on every side!
When ardent fancy's faery hues have died,
What pain the dread realities inspire,&mdash;
When all the angel forms that wont to glide
Mid the fair fields are changed to spectres dire,
For ever quenched and cold the Muse's mounting fire.

Or when some dear-loved partner of our joys,
In whom we lived, &mdash; who lived in us, &mdash; is gone;
When for the soothing smile, the cheering voice,
Nought, nought is left but the cold marble stone
And dust enshrined, &mdash; O then how heavy grown
Are all the glories of the vernal year,
How vainly from the verdant copsewood thrown
The varied woodnotes wild!  how changed appear
The meads of many flowers, the lake-waves sparkling clear!

And chief, if mid the stilly hours of night,
When all is hushed, and the soft vapours float
On wood and word, and odours of delight
Rise from the groves, some wandering matin note
Has from the torpor of thy sorrow brought
The feelings keen of life-consuming woe&mdash;
Then all the wild-wood scenes with rapture sought
In former hours bright visions to bestow,
But nerve the shrinking arm to point the impious blow.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

But on the wanderer fell the influence new
Of some high power, and rivetted awhile,
He stood upon the brink, then backward drew,
Where stood a Form with most unearthly smile,
Whose presence did his fell intent beguile;&mdash;
That loathly shape was rolled in vapours hoar,
That half-concealed his hell-born features vile,
His right hand held a dagger stained with gore;
"Diest thou?  O base resolve!  thy just revenge forbore!"

The Form decayed; for on the eastern sky
A gleam of rising purple did appear,
But in the tangled wood a rustling nigh
Proclaimed that one of mortal race drew near.
There is! &mdash; his hoary locks are thin and sere&mdash;
His aged cheeks are worn by keenest woes:&mdash;
A transient gleam of long-lost joy sincere
Rises in Halbert's eye, as now he knows
The Knight, and at his feet his way-worn frame he throws.

They twain were silent, but the Minstrel drew
Forth from his mantle's fold a naked brand,
It is the sword that Lady Marion slew,
When guided by the ruthless traitor's hand.
It is her blood whose drops congealed stand
On the sharp blade; her guiltless blood that cries
To heaven for vengeance on a murderous band!&mdash;
The knight received the sword with streaming eyes&mdash;
Anon in fury sought to quell his miseries.

And forward, forward through the scenes of morn,
They twain the tangled pathway did pursue;
The scenes to them so desolate and forlorn
Were decked by all that can enchant the view:
The woods were veiled in mist and hung with dew&mdash;
The skies in purple brilliance were arrayed,
And all the scenes adorned with magic hue,
Ten thousand songsters from the flowery shade
Awoke the song of joy, and sweetest music made.

The long, long valley opened on their view,
Where seen afar the dancing waters shone;
And flocks and herds reposing mid the dew,
And scattered hamlets fair to look upon.
And now an echoing blast the knight hath blown;
The well-known-bugle notes were heard afar,
Resounding 'mid the cliffs and caverns lone:
Where all was peace, now all was roused for war,
As when a smiling sea the rising tempests mar.

Then might you, from the tranquil hamlets, view
At once the shepherd gay and maiden fair,
Blythe as the sunbeams, pure as morning dew,
And aged dame, and seer with hoary hair,
And childhood's happy race come forth to share
The tidings which the echoing notes proclaim:&mdash;
And many a shepherd from his heathy lair,
Where all night long the flocks a watcher claim,
Forth to the eye of day from his concealment came.

O happy, happy scene!  might this but last!
Tell not, my song, how soon the charms decay!
Tell not how these fair visions fade so fast,
That Memory scarce can tell they once had sway!&mdash;
Tell not how soon the bright hues melt away,
That o'er life's dread realities are cast?
How soon dark wintry clouds deform the day,
And Innocence and Bliss for ever past,
Fade like the autumn leaves from winter's withering blast.

So fares it with each earthly gleam of joy,
As then it fared in that sweet pastoral vale;
Now all is calm and sheltered from annoy,
Now all o'erwhelmed in wintry tempests pale&mdash;
O Disappointment!  stern supporter!  hail,
Give to my soul thy animating glow!
Give me to prize whate'er within the pale
Of mortal grasp of happiness can flow,
And seize each fleeting bliss bestowed on man below!

The Knight, that in the shock of headlong speed
But sought to lose the o'erwhelming sense of woe,
In silence hurried on through moor and mead,
And to his aged follower left to shew
The cause that gave that echoing blast to blow.
Then quick as meteor might'st thou mark the fire
Of martial ardour through the valley glow&mdash;
And armour donned in haste by son and sire,
And even the sorrowful maids to join their aid conspire.

The sun shone brightly and the breezes blew,
And onward with unwearied pace they fare,
From crag to crag the tangled path pursue:
Little recked they of Nature's beauties rare;
Nor staid the sweets of sylvan scene to share,
But forward, as the lion to his prey,
Right on they go through rocky pathways bare,
Till well nigh done was the sweet vernal day,
And the sun shot afar his level streaming ray.

Then had they come to lovely Ellerslie,
Lovely alas!  of yore, and jocund too!
Yet lovely in decay!  the brilliancy
Of setting sunbeams gave the scene to view.
The groves that late were decked in many a hue
Of brightest bloom, a wilderness of flowers,
Were scorched and dead; black smoke and ashes threw.
Their sooty veil o'er the once happy bowers;&mdash;
O days too lightly prized and aye-departed hours!

O life!  how soon thy vernal charms decay,
Even though by fell misfortune unassailed,
Thy joys the short gleams of an April day,
How soon by gathering clouds and tempests veiled!&mdash;
With cries of vengeance now the warriors hailed
The towers of Ellerslie erewhile so fair,
Where all the horrors of decay prevailed,
And yet the smouldering embers tinged the air
With lurid smoke, and all was ruin and despair.

The Knight but cast one look of anguish keen,
Where once had flourished his sweet lady's bower,
Then turned him from the soul-distracting scene,
While doubled terrors on his brow did lour.
Fast, fast they hied them from the ruined tower
And the sweet sylvan vale, and now the day
Was done indeed, &mdash; and twilight 'gan to pour
Her mellow light; &mdash; then in the south the ray
Of moonlight fair arose, and led them on their way.

The town was hushed, and all seemed slumbering there,
Only the watcher on the tower appeared;
But Heaven seemed in their enterprize to share,
And WALLACE with a shout the fosse has cleared.
And his brave band by his example cheered,
Close following, their leader's steps pursue:&mdash;
The while his threatening arm on high upreared,
Awed the weak sentinel, his followers true
Right onward to his aid with rapid progress drew.

Pass we the scene of blood; the moon on high
That saw the avenger's warlike band draw near;
Saw them depart; the murderer lifeless lie,
Ghastly in death: &mdash; the rising radiance clear
Of gentle morning 'gan the woods to cheer,
When they the well-known valley did regain,
Where all the scenes in wonted charms appear;&mdash;
Alas!  to bosoms torn by cureless pain,
Such charms are mockery all!  such landscape smiles in vain.

The rustic maidens, innocent and gay,
Prepare the couch for way-worn warrior meet,
Who from the dawning of a former day
Had toiled the work of vengeance to complete;
And WALLACE, mid the cavern's dim retreat,
Found shelter from the garish eye of day;
Vengeance was wreaked; the balmy odours sweet
Of heath flowers bathed his forehead as he lay;
And for a space in sleep his anguish died away.

Then rose the form (as erst to Petrarch's eye
His Laura's shade) of Marion, heavenly fair;
Then faded slow; and rising harmony
Told of the matchless joys that angels share,
Yet left a dreary void for dire despair&mdash;
Anon that dreary void was filled anew
By sounds and shapes of wondrous import rare,
And tinged by radiance of enchanting hue&mdash;
Most earnestly on them the hero fixed his view.&mdash;

A female form arose, of loveliness,
But she was bathed in tears, and all around
Were sights and sounds of pain and wretchedness;
And all with chains that lovely dame was bound.
And now she kneeled upon the scorched ground
The while her merciless enemy reared on high
A blood-stained brand, still threatening many a wound,
And nought was given unto the hopeless eye
But images of woe, and want, and misery.

Then might'st thou mark the Autumn's golden store
In flames ascend; anon in ashes lie;
And cities razed; and hamlets of the poor;
A dusky waste most mournful to the eye,
The "monuments" of England's "cruelty."
Sudden that lovely dame, a transient ray
Of hope reviving, looked imploringly
On Wallace, and for vengeance:  seemed to pray
On the fell bands that wrought that ruin and decay.

Thereon a burst of heavenly music rose,
A long unearthly strain of sweetness rare;
And to the watcher's eye the scenes disclose
A form whose charms what minstrel might declare?
Her right hand held a verdant chaplet fair
Of laurel leaves; her left a trumpet bore;&mdash;
"Thy love is gone the joys of Heaven to share;
And wilt thou die for her and love no more?&mdash;
No, thou shalt live for me, and Scotland's weal restore!"

The sky-lark mounting 'mid the realms of day,
Was carolling his joyful song on high;
Anon the magic visions died away,
And space was left for dread reality;
And with a groan of wakening agony
The hero met the sun's inspiring ray&mdash;
"O Marion blest!  O days of ecstacy,
Ere duly prized, for ever fled away!"&mdash;
Lowly upon the earth the vanquished victor lay.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

A lovely sylvan scene it was, where high
The wooded rocks in wild luxuriance piled,
Rose circular in awful canopy,
And all beneath sweet greensward tomhans  smiled,
And murmuring streams the weary mind beguiled:
There never foot of man had trod before;
The tranquil solitude:  was undefiled,
A virgin fortress:  and boon Nature's store
Of fruits and wild flowers bright adorned the mountains hoar.

There notes divine of Heaven's own minstrelsy
Rung to the echoes of the rocks around,
And mingled with the ceaseless accents high
Of foaming cataracts that their way had wound
From ledge to ledge of rock; or under ground
Their secret course they took, and strangely lent
To watchful ears variety of sound&mdash;
In sooth through all the faery scenes were blent
All sweetest sights and sounds for lonely merriment.

The lonely wanderer that had thither come,
If wanderer e'er had thither bent his way,
Beneath the shelter of the sylvan dome
Might joyful pass the longest summer's day,
Nor e'er become to weariness the prey;
So many varied treasures there abound&mdash;
O sweet to hear the foaming currents play!
O sweet to sit with rustic garlands crowned,
Or search amid the rocks for caverns most profound!

By the fair features of the sylvan scene
Entranced, almost I had forgot to tell
That in the lovely wilderness serene
Sequestered far, an Eremite did dwell;
Yet if to mortal wanderer befell
To tread that sylvan wild, yet never one
That dared against the will of God rebel,
Or innocent blood had shed, or deed had done,
Or thought conceived of ill, that paradise had won.

No &mdash; this old Hermit was a sinless soul,
That loved his beads to tell both night and day
Nor knew the stain of worldly passions foul,
Nor impulses of sin did e'er obey;
'Mid the deep caverns of the mountain grey
His dwelling was, whence loved he still to view
The varied woodland charms that round him lay;
The while Devotion on the scenery threw
Her own enchanting light of purest heavenly hue.

But yet the Wallace and his armed train
Knew not the presence of the Hermit old;
But gladly saw that all pursuit was vain,
And with delight their fortress 'gan behold,
Where still so far the ponderous fragments rolled
Their bulk enormous on the inward dell,
So many secret caverns did unfold,
That 'mid the fastness of this rocky cell
Free from each hostile band they might in safety dwell.

And Halbert had to Bothwell sped the while,
To raise the friends of Liberty and Fame;
And they had but the moments to beguile,
Till the brave Murray to their rescue came.
Meanwhile the youthful band would ditties frame
Of pastoral joy, yet more of chivalry,
Nor needs there pastime rude or artful game
For solace of their idlesse hours to try;
Nor languishment they knew 'mid that sweet scenery.

There greensward tomhans, lovely to behold,
With wild-wood crowned, arose, and many a flower,
Where faery trains their mystic revels hold,
Still by the moonlight pale at midnight hour;
And still the crystal streams their waters pour,
Murmuring those haunted eminences among;
And O how sweetly from the secret bower
Awakes the woodlark gay his cheering song!
Him join the blackbird loud, and all the feathered throng.

In such a scene, at such a season gay,
How beats the swelling heart attuned to joy!
How quickly fades each darkening trace away,
Of earthly passion vain, and base annoy!
(For even the lightest hearts have some alloy
Of mortal care) but to the widowed heart
Whom wonted charms can never more employ,
Such beauties but increase the cruel smart,
And fiercer throbs of woe and fond regret impart.

Thus fared the Knight &mdash; from rock to rock he went
Each rocky path and object to explore,
And waste in bodily toil his discontent;
And now he finds a secret archway hoar;
A channel deep it was that torrents wore
Of wintry tempests bred; but now the flow
Of those unruly cataracts was o'er,
And lichens on the grey rocks 'gan to grow,
And spear glass to ascend, and vernal flowers to blow.

This pathway found, with gratitude the band
Gladly each rude impediment clear away,
That might their sudden secret march withstand;
And when they gain the beams of upper day,
Most carefully a covering they lay
To veil the portal from invaders' view;
And thence departing, with like toil assay
Their first-found path from every hostile crew,
With ponderous rocks to bar, and boughs of verdant hue.

Night fell, and not, as wont, did lingering light
Cheer the fair chambers of the northern heaven,
But gathering storms and phantoms of affright
In wild disorder o'er the skies were driven;
Nor aught of soothing moonlight ray was given:
Night fell, and darkness brooded on the scene;
While Wallace watched the darkening clouds of even,
First, for a space, he owned a mood serene
Steal on his heart, &mdash; the gift of sympathy I ween.

Most mournful to Misfortune's heavy eye
Is the fair scene when vernal sunbeams glow,
But when the clouds of eve portentously
Settle around, and rising night-winds blow,
Or when sweet Autumn's last, last lingering shew
Of yellow gleams is past, and damp and brown
The leaves in sooty wreaths are strewed below
The parent boughs, and clouds the mountain crown,
Then even, Despair, thine heart a transient joy must own!

But, hark!  O whence the fearful sounds that rise,
Borne on the gale?  what wanderers are nigh?
Is it the fell Fiend's fatal witcheries,
That seeks the good to ruin to decoy;
Is it some victim sad of treachery,
Struggling beneath the assassin's pitiless blow?
Hark, hark again!  from yonder summit high,
Where a faint gleam of twilight seems to glow,
The fearful shrieks are borne; &mdash; "What ho!  brave comrades, ho!"

Fast, fast as wild-fire through the secret way,
The armament their hurried course pursue,
Till the wide heath they tread, where not a ray
Of moonlight tremblingly gives aught to view&mdash;
But hark again! &mdash; his sword each warrior drew,
And by the sound directed 'gan to fly&mdash;
But now, the louring tempest breaking through,
A gleam of moonlight lights the scenery,
And straight reveals a scene of direst cruelty.

There lay upon the heath a lovely form,
That with a reckless demon struggled sore
(For none, save demon, fell as midnight storm,
To loveliness such malice ever bore.)
At once the patriot band in wrath him tore
From his fair prey, and him with fetters bound,
And his detested train, resistance o'er,
And man by man laid prostrate on the ground,
Fit guerdon for their deeds in chains and fetters found.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

The Maiden woke, and lovely lustre shone
In the full orb of her inspiring eye;
Whence beams of hope and fortitude were thrown
On her deliverers brave inchantingly;
Sweet as the moon-beam's mild serenity,
That speaks unto the riven heart of woe,
And bids the phantom forms of madness fly;&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

So woke the Maiden &mdash; soothing as the ray
Of moonlight &mdash; lovely as the beam of morn,
When emanating through the frost-fog grey,
Whose banners Autumn's fairy scenes adorn;
(O what a tide of cherished thoughts are borne
Swift on my soul!)  but now the Maiden bright,
When deft amid that rocky cell forlorn,
None present save the Eremite and Knight,
Most fearful tidings told, and treacheries brought to light.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
