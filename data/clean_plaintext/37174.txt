In that sweet season of the infant year,
When clouds of gold o'erhang the brow of eve,
When all the woods their verdant livery wear,
And glancing waves the green reflections give:
When nature's charms in full perfection life,
And soft Favonius from his rosy wing
Sheds perfumes which the sense to joy revive,
And in full chorus of the breathing spring,
From every forest-shade the plumy nations sing:

When vernal beauty gladdens the green plains,
And smiling splendour dwells on nature's face,
When in the air a living spirit reigns,
Oft would my steps the arborous labyrinth trace
Of some umbrageous glade, or in the chace
Of murmuring bee, through fields of hyacinth roam,
And mark the wild deer, that with agile grace
Bounded close by me to his leafy dome&mdash;
All-heedless of the dews that called my footsteps home:

Oft on some mountain's purple summit rais'd,
To view declining Phoebus leave the sky,
On every side in soft delight I gaz'd,
While tears of pensive rapture dimm'd mine eye.
"Thus, thus," I said, "in fields of glory die
The Patriot-brave, who strive to break the chain
That bound their country's soul to slavery&mdash;
Oh, while on earth a sense of worth remain,
Cherished their names shall be, and sacred from all stain.

"The noble few in Pylae's pass who stemmed
The shrinking millions of the Persian lord,
And wrapped his camp in flames, fell not till hemm'd
By circling nations &mdash; till their limbs were gored
In horrid strife &mdash; when all with one accord,
For one last effort rousing all their heat,
In phalanxed order fierce destruction poured,
Each stretch'd a hundred Persians at his feet,
And Asia's monarch feared for his imperial seat.

"But fainting nature now refus'd to wield
The pond'rous sword, or hurl the flying spear;
All-useless from their arms the battered shield
Reclined &mdash; when from the Thermian hills appear
The midnight bands &mdash; and on the deafened ear
Burst the barbaric shout &mdash; on, on they pour&mdash;
The Grecians saw, but no debasing fear
Oppress'd their hearts in that tremendous hour;
Undaunted &mdash; still serene &mdash; they saw the tempest lour&mdash;

"The shades of death were on them &mdash; and they fell,
Buried in carnage that their valour made&mdash;
Thessalia's plains the richest crimson drank
That e'er in human veins hath proudly played,
Sublimer courage never was displayed;
Admiring ages eternize their name,
And the sweet muse in deathless numbers bade
The dirgeful harp their matchless worth proclaim&mdash;
Their mighty deeds record &mdash; record the despot's shame.

"Yet doubly glorious was that strenuous day,
With double laurels crown'd; the rising sun
Beheld the Asian fleets, in proud array,
Swarm o'er the shaded ocean; when begun
(Ere Phoebus yet his noontide race had run)
To Doric measures, and the martial strain
Of sacred paean (both combined in one
Harmonious melody) the naval train
Of stedfast Greece to plough the wide cerulean plain.

"True &mdash; they were few &mdash; but they were led by those
With whom to fear a greater wonder seem'd
Than aught imagination can disclose,
Or bard hath sung, or prophet ever dreamed:
Full to the air their waving pennants streamed;
Broad to the sun their brazen bucklers blaz'd,
Their helmets glisten'd, and their lances gleam'd.
Awed, panic-struck, the mute barbarians gaz'd,
Waiting the stern attack, with eyes by terror glazed.

"And now the clamours of the battle swell,
Euboea's shores the dread alarms resound;
On every side with iron tempest fell&mdash;
The fight was hid; and o'er the blue profound
Death reign'd in every shape, and stalk'd around;
Nor did the havoc or the slaughter cease,
Till not a Persian bark was found;
Till Victory garlanded the brows of Greece&mdash;
And yielded to her sway the empire of the seas.

Such were the deeds that round th' admiring world
Bore the proud tidings of Hellenic fame:
Where'er Achaia's standard was unfurll'd
The gladden'd nations hail'd with loud acclaim
The fostering glories of her conquering name.
For not alone in arms was she renown'd&mdash;
With her the heaven-descended muses came;
And where the cords of slavery she unbound,
She pour'd with freedom's light, the light of art around."

Thus would I muse upon the glorious days
Of ancient fame, and my quick pulse would beat
To livelier measures, while I told their praise,
The mountain-echoes would the sound repeat,
And to my ear restore them.  From my seat
Among the rocks, I viewed the gray-rob'd heaven;
For now the westering sun had gone to greet
Atlantic skies, and virgin-vested Even
A soft and blending tint to all the scene had given.

And from behind her cloudy rampart rose
The argent empress of the starry host;
Though day's fierce lord intense lustre shows,
Her silvery tints delight my soul the most.
Calm meditation, every sense engross'd,
Thoughts of the days that were &mdash; dear, happy hours,
Ere life its keener edge of bliss had lost&mdash;
When carelessly I wander'd mid the bowers
Of blameless infancy, and cropped their tender flowers.

And when the mild sultana of the night
Climbed her high arch of moon, and from her ear
The pure effulgence of her pearly light
Stream'd o'er the heavens, and dimm'd each weeping star,
(Weeping to see itself eclipsed) and far
In her white beams the dark-green foliage shone,
And sparkling rivers o'er their beds of spar
Rolled their transparent waves &mdash; to rove alone
Was my supreme delight &mdash; nor have I ever known

A purer joy than such enchanting scenes
Yield my transported heart; when all is still,
When soothing quietness the breast serenes,
And the soft murmurs of a brawling rill,
Gurgling beside some green and moonlight hill,
Makes music to the ear &mdash; and whispering winds
The atmosphere with dewy fragrance fill&mdash;
Oh!  contemplation every instant finds
Some new attraction still for elevated minds:&mdash;

Yon heavens that clasp in their cerulean arms
Millions of orbs, that with bright beamy grace
The etherial depths, possess superior charms
To al the brightest fancy e'er could trace:
There, thron'd beyond the bounds of time and place,
Dwells that Almighty Power, whose high decrees
The universe fulfils &mdash; whose mandates chase
The breath of life &mdash; or chain the dire disease&mdash;
Heave all the waves in storms, or hush the raging seas!

The fragile flower that by yon river-bank
Folds its fine leaves, and droops its delicate head,
Holds in reflection's eye a prouder rank
Than stateliest domes and palaces that spread
Th' encumber'd earth:  and where doth beauty shed
So rich a bloom as in the rose's blush?
And to what higher source can man be led
Of majesty, than where broad cataracts gush
Sublime from Alpine heights, and through the vallies rush?

Regions of wonder!  where La Plata leads
Round half the globe his swift and boundless streams;
And rock-ribbed Andes lift their Titan-heads,
And catch the eastern sun's scarce-slanting beams,
While yet in Europe's climes his last ray gleams;
And mountain-oceans, bason'd high in air,
And vast millenian shades, the grand extremes
Of nature's varied sovereignty, declare
The Mighty Hand that form'd, that rear'd, and plac'd them there!

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

How deep the silence!  pure the soft night-air!
Day's sultriness is gone, and in its stead
The Cynthian freshness and the dews repair&mdash;
The cares and clamours of the world are fled&mdash;
This grassy bank shall be my sylvan bed;
Here will I lie and con bewitching themes,
While fragrant airs delicious coolness shed.
