Oh, sacred memory, tablet of the heart!
Thou breathing shadow of departed days!
Still ever prompt to wake the ling'ring smart,
And backward lure the visionary gaze&mdash;
Thou tellest but of scenes that, melted by,
Are vanish'd now like wreaths of winter snow;
The tear of sorrow gems thy lucid eye,
And yet so beauteous is thy garb of woe,
Enamour'd still, we clasp thy fond regret,
Too tender to renounce, too pleasing to forget!

Unpitying absence wraps in distant shroud
Full many a charm that deck'd our earlier doom;
Thy stronger radiance brightens thro' the cloud,
Again they flourish, and again they bloom:
The kindred ties that hold us down to earth,
The wife, the friend, the parent, sink in turn;
Thou livest to retrace their love and worth,
And snatch their image from the marble urn:
O'er time's dread course thy victor pinions wave,
And burst with eagle strength the slumbers of the grave.

Not the wide tracts of ocean, or of land,
Nor all the changing seasons as they roll,
Can bound thy glance, repress thy glowing hand,
Or blot thy fairy pictures from the soul:
Thy viewless spirit floats amid the morn,
Meridian skies as sweetly they rejoice,
Tell of the past, and, on the evening borne,
We sadly hear thy melancholy voice
Sigh in the flutters of the trembling gale
That sweeps the mountain brow, or mourns along the vale.
