Kind Auster!  with dissolving Breeze,
From Afric's warmer Regions come!
And back to Zembla's icy Seas
O!  drive thy Ruffian Brother home.&mdash;
Come!  and with Gales benign and bland
Loose from his Frosts our fetter'd Land;
Again O!  let the Naiads lead
Their Waters thro' the thirsty Mead;
Again with Damps prepare the tainted Ground,
To charm with Odours strong the rapture-breathing Hound.

Tho' Paeon's Sons in angry Strain
Thy moisture-dropping Wings accuse,
And say Hygeia's Foes remain
In Ambush 'midst thy balmy Dews;
Say, shall not Britain's hardy Youth
Deny such such Dreams the Seal of Truth?
Who, when they wake the misty Morn
With Carrols blythe of Hound and Horn,
Find manlier Strength their active Sinews steel,
Than 'midst surrounding Frosts the skaiting Belgians feel.

O!  then attend thy Suppliant's Pray'r!
Awhile unbend the stubborn Soil,
Shed thy moist Influence thro' the Air,
And wake again the Hunter's Toil:
So from each Hill, and ev'ry Grove,
Where'er Diana's Vot'ries rove,
While all around the jocund Cry
With mimic Thunder rends the Sky,
Each sportive Youth, with eager Transport pale,
In many a chearful Note shall bless thy friendly Gale.
