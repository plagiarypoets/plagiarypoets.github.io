As when the demon of the summer storm
Walks forth, the noon-tide landscape to deform;
Dark grows the vale, and dark the distant grove,
And thick the bolts of angry Jove
Athwart the wat'ry welkin glide,
And streams th' aerial torrent far and wide:
If by short fits the struggling day
Should dart a momentary ray,
Th' illumin'd mountain gleams awhile;
By faint degrees the radiant glance
Purple th' horizon's pale expanse,
And gilds the gloom with hasty smile:
Ah!  fickle smile, too swiftly past!
Again returns the driving blast:
With rage renew'd the tempest howls,
Again the blackening concave scowls;&mdash;
Sudden, the shades of the meridian night
Yield to the triumph of rekindling light:
The reddening sun regains his golden sway,
And Nature stands reveal'd in all her bright array.
