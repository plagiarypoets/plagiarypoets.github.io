Beneath the gloomy cover of an yew,
That taints the grass with sickly sweats of dew,
Where no fair beauty entertains the sight,
But baneful hemlock and cold aconite;
There in a grot the meagre haggard lay,
Breathing black vengeance, and infecting day;
The chearful blood her livid eyes forsook,
And basilisks sat brooding in her look.
A bald and bloated toad-stool rais'd her head,
And plumes of boding ravens were her bed:
From her chapp'd nostrils scalding torrents fall,
And her sunk eyes boil o'er in floods of gall.
