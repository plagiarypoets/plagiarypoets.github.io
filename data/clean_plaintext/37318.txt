Frae the bed-head auld Geordy took his kent
At the cock-craw, an' dadart owr the bent,
To visit Robin, lang his neebour near,
An' mutual aid made them to ither dear.

GEORDY.
Guid mournin' Rob, lang mat ye live to see
The sun blink owr this morn an' happy be.
I thought this day day-break wad ne'er appear,
Sae fair I lang't to wiss ye a guid Year.

ROBIN.
Braw thanks my lad; lang may ye see this day
Come fraught to you wi' ilka thing but wae.
Fu fair I've wearied for my neebour true
Sin' the first cock his scraichin' clarion blew.
Three score o times the spring the gowan's sent,
Sin' we this day held happily content.
'Twas Marr's Year &mdash; I mind fu' weel the day
Whan we first canty held our hog-ma-nae.
Ye than was just new married on a Kate;
An' I on Jenny bonny mim an' blate.
Now Geordy lad, I'm whiles sae fell'd wi' fear,
That whisp'rin tells our partin's drawin near.

GEORDY.
The langest day that e'er the warl saw
Aneath night's shade did blink itsel awa.
But Robin lad, the wretch needs only dread,
Wha hads to heaven the darin' impious head;
An' whase predominant gate has been thro' life
To mete an' mingle unto ithers grief.
But sober stock whase doon nae feck o' ill,
Has houps aboon, lat death come whan he will.
This saxty Years ye've paid the laird his fee&mdash;
An' to a' man gi'en Justice wi' a' sweigh.
Afore the Court I'd tak a sacred aith,
Ye'd thole grit hurt 'fore ye'd do ony skaith.
Ye've kept the kirk an' ordinances due,
An' gane as straight as sinfu' clay can do.
An' tho' fock do their best &mdash; I'm free to swear
They'll while rub shouthers wi' pollution here.
Do a' ye can &mdash; lat heaven do the laive&mdash;
We'll get perfection south side o' the grave.

That I this mornin' might mair happy had,
I sent yestreen for cotter's lass and lad,
A cog o' yill did on the gantry faem
That an' guid meat I coupit i' their wame.
Syne took them to the big potatoe bing,
An' owr ilk shouther did four firlots fling.
Sax bowes o' meal, nae mill did better grind,
I took an' parted 'mang them to a pound.
A guid fat wadder gae to ilka hearth
To gar their bairnies loup an' dance wi' mirth.
An' Katty gied them a' a pickle woo'
To cleid their back, sin' I had fed their mou'.
And sent them in a kebbuck an' some yill,
To tak on New Year's morn a hearty sweel.
An' sin' the storm has steekt them i' the house
They'll happy be &mdash; an' crak like us fu cruse
I tentit them this morn, unseen, alane,&mdash;
An' my heart glowed to see them a' sae fain.

ROBIN.
It gars my heart ay loup wi' merry glee,
Whan my friends turn an' mine sae cosh agree.
Yestreen my Jenny dandart owr the gate
An' brought the cotters ere the hour grew late.
What she did gie I cannae realy tell,
But a' their bairns were haddin' her gown tail.
Their fathers cryin &mdash; 'Lord bless ye, lucky wife!
Lang mat your ha' be stow'd wi' blessin's rife!
Sae cosh she pangs their amery or kist,
That a' my life I never yet did mis't.
Syne round her a' her servants made to hoddle,
An' paid them a' their wages to a boddle.
Ilk lad a sark &mdash; ilk maid a snood she gae,&mdash;
An' gar't them rantin' had their hog-ma-nae.
An' few need peenge aneath misfortune's glowr
Was fock do a' the guid that's i' their power.

GEORDY.
The grit-man's gate obsequious rowes the hinge
For lordly guests &mdash; while servants to them beenge,
An' stow the board wi' mair than it dowe had,
While countless teinds gang supperless to bed;
Rise up niest morn mair dowie than the lift,
Whan sable clouds toom down their balefu' drift.
This is the pinchin', scanty, time o' year,
Whan rich an' bien soud strew their orrow geer:
To wae-worn fock dung doil'd, an' haddin down,
I' the lane village, or the mickle town.
A very little strings the peasant's heart,
Gars his hearth bleise, and does the grit nae hurt.

ROBIN.
They'll rather guzzle till they cannae glowr
Ere they had help out to the feckless poor:
An' tho' inclement frown the wintry skies,
They lounge utentive the poor man's cries.
Fortune frae heaven comes couthsome to ane's house
Wi' guid intent to be of solid use:
She dowe nae bide to glance frae place to place,
For ostentation's pleasure to embrace:
An' gif we use her this way soon an' late,
She will some time fu' dourly tak the pet,
An' slight us for our lack o' common sense,
That dinnae ken what way to do her mence:
Or soud we dern her in a neuks sae grey
She pettit gangs wi' spendthrift chaps awa.
She likes to tread wi' peace the Sylvan vale,
Wi' canny comrads an' the sober meal:
An' aft she soud be treat to tak a look,
Where poverty sits cauldrife i' the nook.
At proper times to tak her to the town,
An' there 'mang liberal sauls to set her down:
Lat tim'd hilarity upo' her wait,
And strict oeconomy attend her gate.
An' now an' then lead her to dungeon's cell
Where misery wi' awefu horrors dwell:
Whare meagre poor tied wi' the tyrant's hand,
Clank their strange chains i' Britain's feelin' land.&mdash;
An' after she's doon there what guid she can,
To tak her back to Sylvan shades again.

GEORDY.
There she soud tent the pleugh-man on the lee,
An' to his ruggit toil her succor gie:
Tell him the right way to improve his haugh,
Till a fu' barn-yeard gleefu' mak him laugh:
To mak his fields sprout wi' a better green;
And sleeker woo' upon' his flocks be seen.
Niest whare the garden spreads her bosom fair,
At leisure hours, her feet soud dander there:
Whare heaven all-potent veils the power o' art,
An' wafts a warl' of odor to the heart.
An aft she soud be led unto the shore,
Whare trade an' commerce ply the eident oar,
To gie new pith unto the merchant's hand,
That he may send his wares athort the land.
These are the bairns that supplicate her ear,
An' she wi' these soud jocund spend the Year.
Gif itherways grit-fock, distort her mind,
They're mockin' heav'n, whase been to them sae kind.

It's unco cruel to tak her to a race;
An' amang jockies stain her wi' disgrace:
Or whare the gamester sits wi' features gair,
To spulzie her o' her pang'd pouches there:
Or whare the drunkarts sit wi' plooky nose,
Wha owr the quegh's strang faem insipid dose:
Or whare the steghin' gluttons nauseous dwell,
An' mak their wames the kettle-pans o' h-ll,
Mish-mashin creatures for their greed or gust,
An' feed a lumber-load for worms an' dust.
Insensate brutes!  the thrid what they destroy
Sae nauseously, wad to God's poor gie joy.
Wad help the lanely widow to dispel
The clouds o' wae, that hing out owr her cell.

ROBIN.
We'll crak nae mair o' this &mdash; we cannae mend
The unco ills that stain this sinfu land.&mdash;
We'll ben the house &mdash; I hear my Jane's asteer&mdash;
An' get her beneson i' the New Year.
Yestreen she made a haggis fat and guid,
An' singit weel a dainty wather's head,
Her bottle prim'd, came last night frae the town,
An' a guid pye is ready for the oo'n.
We'll spend the day as harmless as we may,
Like sober fock, bound for eternal day.
