Fashion, bright arbitress supreme,
Whilst I thy praise rehearse,
And make thy magic pow'r my theme,
O stamp thy sanction on my verse!
Then, tho' uncouth it roll along,
Like some rude crier's ill-rhim'd song,
Devoid of harmony and ease;
Still, bless'd by thee, my lays shall please.
Thy vot'ries, then, with raptures near divine,
Shall praise the charming thought, and sweet harmonious line.

Should'st thou refuse thy potent aid,
Tho' Milton's thought be there,
And imag'ry like his display'd,
Still must the sighing bard despair;
No tongue shall yield him honest praise,
Nor pretty Misses read his lays:
In vain, poor fellow!  must he write;
In vain essay to give delight;
Unless thy fame bestowing hand, O Ton!
With friendly aid should deign to consecrate his song.

On earth thy influence is such,
So absolute thy sway,
That, by thy all-commanding touch,
We swear, and lye, and preach, and pray.
Revers'd, by thee thou magic sprite,
Shall right be wrong, and wrong be right;
Deform'd shall Beauty's self appear,
And discord charm the ravish'd ear;
By thee shall dulness triumph, in despite
Of what declaimers say, or monthly critics write.

By thee, O'Keefe, with trite old pun,
Shall meet the applauding roar
Of those who hail him Humour's son,
And crown him with a loud encore:
By thee his thrice-told obscene jest,
Tho' in the coarsest language drest,
Aided by Edwin's comic faces,
Shall boast a multitude of graces;
Grimace and jargon pass for sterling wit,
And senseless ribaldry be deem'd "a damn good hit."

Like thee, with absolute command,
Once superstition reign'd;
And over Egypt's fertile land,
A long unrivall'd sway maintain'd:
As then Religion's name she bore,
Deluded millions own'd her pow'r;
She render'd sacred ev'ry sod,
And rais'd each trifle to a god;
Bade Egypt's sons, as ignorant as meek,
Sing hymns to unions, and adore a leek.
