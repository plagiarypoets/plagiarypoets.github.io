Thro' the dark forest &mdash; o'er the barb'rous coast,
The savage roves; nor mourns the desert gloom;
His wishes point not to a gentler home:
Nor pants his heart for joys he ne'er has lost.
But the sad exile from some happier shore,
Where Science, Elegance, and Pleasure reign,
Doom'd to revisit the lov'd scene no more,
Feels, from remember'd bliss, redoubled pain:
O'er the wide ocean turns a tearful eye,
And tow'rd his native land breathes many a hopless sigh.

The breast, unconscious of the sacred pow'r
Of social pleasure, thus unmov'd remains:
Thus spends without regret the lonely hour;
Nor of the pain of solitude complains.
But oh!  what pangs must rend his tortur'd heart,
What poignant anguish must his bosom fill,
Who "tremblingly alive" to ev'ry thrill
Of sympathetic joy, is forc'd to part
From Friendship, Love, and all his soul holds dear,
To burst the tender tie, and shed the parting tear!&mdash;
