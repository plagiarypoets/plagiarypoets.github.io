Picton and Posonby!  a grateful land
In her proud annals now records her grief,
On arch, urn, obelisk, with trembling hand
Your praise indenting.  Thine, no high relief
Shall tell, my Brother!  but memorial brief,
This humble tribute from Affection due.
Whilst England holds the dust of each lov'd Chief,
Mine is the reminiscence ever new&mdash;
That one small speck is thine in grave-strew'd Waterloo!
