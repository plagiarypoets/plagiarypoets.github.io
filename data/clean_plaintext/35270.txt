Lo!  I, the man whose Muse did whilom mask
(So FREEDOM taught) in high-voic'd Minstrel's weeds,
Am now enforced &mdash; a far unfitter task,
For Cap and Gown to leave the Patriot's meeds,
For yon dull noise, that tinkles thro' the air,
Bids me lay by the Lyre, and go to Matin Pray'r.

O, how I hate the sound! &mdash; It is the knell,
That still a requiem tolls to Comfort's hour;
And loth am I, at SUPERSTITION'S Bell,
To quit or MORPHEUS' or the MUSE'S Bower.
Better to lie and dose, than gape amain,
Hearing still mumbled o'er the same eternal strain!

Thou tedious Herald of more tedious Pray'rs,
Say, hast thou ever summon'd from his rest
One Being wak'ning to Religious cares,
Or rous'd one pious transport in the breast?
Or rather, do not all reluctant creep&mdash;
To linger out the hour, in listlessness or sleep?

I love the Bell that calls the Poor to pray,
Chiming, from Village Church its cheerful sound,
When the Sun smiles on LABOUR'S Holiday,
And all the Rustic train are gather'd round&mdash;
Each deftly dizen'd in his Sunday's best,
And pleas'd to hail the day of Piety and Rest.

And when, dim-shadowing o'er the face of day,
The mantling mists of even-tide rise slow,
As thro' the forest gloom I wend my way,
The Minster Curfew's sullen roar I know:&mdash;
I pause; and love its solemn toll to hear,
As, made by distance soft, it dies upon the ear!

Nor not to me th' unfrequent midnight knell
Tolls sternly-harmonising:  on mine ear
As the deep death-fraught sounds long ling'ring dwell,
Sick to the heart of Hope, and Love, and Fear,
Soul-jaundic'd, I do loathe Life's upland steep,
And with strange envy muse the Deadman's dreamless sleep!

But thou, memorial of Monastic Gaul!
What fancy, sad or lightsome, hast thou given?
Thy vision-scaring sounds alone recal
The Pray'r that trembles on a yawn to Heaven;
And this Dean's gape, and that Dean's nasal tone,
And Roman Rites retain'd, tho' Roman Faith be flown!
