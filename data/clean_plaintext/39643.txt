Hail!  ye sacred horrors hail!
Which brooding o'er this lonely vale,
Swell the heart, impearl the eye,
And raise the rapt soul to the sky.
Hail!  spirits of the swarthy dead,
Who, flitting thro' the dreary shade,
To rouse your sons to vengeance fell,
Nightly raise the troublous yell!
Hail!  Minister of Ill, whose iron pow'r
Pervades resistless earth, and sea, and air,
Shed all thy influence on this solemn hour,
When we with magic rites the white man's doom prepare.

Thus Congo spake, "what time the moon,
Riding in her highest noon!"
Now beam'd upon the sable crowd,
Now vanish'd in the thickening cloud.
'Twas silence all &mdash; with frantic look,
His spells the hoary wizard took
Bending o'er the quiv'ring flame,
Convulsion shook his giant frame.
Close and more close the shuddering captives throng,
With breath repress'd, and straining eye, they wait&mdash;
When midst the plantains bursts the awful song,
The words of mystic might, that seal their tyrants' fate.

Haste!  the magic shreds prepare&mdash;
Thus the white man's corse we tear.
Lo!  feathers from the raven's plume,
That croaks our proud Oppressor's doom.
Now to aid the potent spell,
Crush we next the brittle shell&mdash;
Fearful omen to the foe,
Look!  the blanched bones we throw.
From mouldering graves we stole this hallow'd earth,
Which, mix'd with blood, winds up the mystic charm;
Wide yawns the grave for all of northern birth,
And soon shall smoke with blood each sable warrior's arm.

Hark!  the pealing thunders roll,
Grateful to the troubled soul.
See!  the gleamy lightnings play,
To point you to your destin'd prey.
Hence!  with silent foot and slow,
And sudden strike the deadly blow:
Your foes, the palmy shade beneath,
Lie lock'd in sleep &mdash; their sleep is death!
Go!  let the memory of the smarting thong
Outplead the pity that would prompt to save:
Go let the Oppressor's contumelious wrong,
Twice nerve the hero's arm, and make the coward brave.
