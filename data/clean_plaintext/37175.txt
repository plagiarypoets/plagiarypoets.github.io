Fantastic toy!  could but my fancy move
With colours lively and as fair as thine,
No foreign muses should awake my love,
But even Grecian graces yield to mine,
Gay as they used to shine.
So brightly fresh thy curious figures flow&mdash;
Now like a dew-wet garland loosely twine,
Now like a tiny rosebud glossy glow,
And softly shrink below.
So when the busy memory turns her glass,
Hours long gone by assume their forms anew:
E'en scattered fragments mingle as they pass
In forms that wear as thine a lovely hue,
Fantastic toy!  and ah!  as transient too.
