Come, shepherds, bewail my sad fate,
You know not how wretched I am;
My ewes seek in vain for a mate,
And next year I shall not have a lamb.

Yet this I could suffer unmov'd,
If Phillis but kindly would look;
If she softly would whisper she lov'd,
I'd give both my pipe and my crook.

Oh!  have I not cause for despair?
No zephyr my passion can cool!
For Phillis (ah, too cruel fair!)
False Phillis declares I'm a fool.
