Nor could the worlds best spirits so much erre,
If death tooke all, that they should all agree,
Before this life their honor to preferre;
For what is praise to things that nothing bee?

Againe, if by the bodies prop she stand,
If on the bodies life, her life depend,
As Meleagers on the fatall brand,
The bodies good she onely would intend.

We should not fine her halfe so brave and bold,
To leade it to the warres, and to the Seas;
To make it suffer watchings, hunger, cold,
When it might feed with plenty, rest with ease.....
