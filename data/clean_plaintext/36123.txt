Her eye is downcast beauty, like some Star
That on th' horizon, till it's hour is come,
Trembles in dewy light; &mdash; her braided hair
Is golden, but 'tis twilight's golden gloom.
Blooming her cheek, but 'tis the timid bloom
Of the young peach, the crimson touched with pale.
That delicate lip doth sigh, and sigh perfume,
But 'tis such humid fragrance as the gale
Wafts from the violet in the sequester'd vale.

Yet this is no soft image of the thought&mdash;
Tho' genius here has stamped its glorious hand,
This form has not from yon blue Heaven been brought,
Nor yet gone thither &mdash; still the rose is fann'd
With life and love's sweet airs, &mdash; the spirit bland
Still round her makes a little Paradise,
Richer and softer than enchanter's wand
E'er summon'd in Earth's wilderness to rise&mdash;
Its talisman her heart, its light her starry eyes.
