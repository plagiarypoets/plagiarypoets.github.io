Unhappy Stranger!  for no sculptur'd shone
Protects thy relics from the rustic spade;
No brier-bound hillock, by its form, has shewn
The little spot of earth where thou wert laid.

Yet shall the Muse bestrew with flow'rs thy grave,
And mark the vanity of human pride,
Mark how alike, the wise, the fair, the brave,
May undistinguish'd in the Tomb abide.

Erewhile, perhaps, his breast with ardor glow'd,
By courage high, and native freedom fir'd,
Before the Saxon, his heart's blood out-flow'd,
And, full of wounds and glory, he expir'd.

Perhaps, a Martyr to his Country's cause,
Against Rebellion his keen blade he tried,
Fought to restore her violated laws,
And in the glorious conflict &mdash; smil'd, and died.

When Winter wild the plain in snow array'd,
To the next Mart he pick'd his dang'rous way,
The gaping Pit his wand'ring steps betray'd,
And treacherous hid him from returning Day.

The faithful Partner of his humble lot,
Impatient, oft look'd out with tearful eye,
Gaz'd on the latchet of the straw-thatch'd cot,
And saw it still unlifted with a sigh.

Perhaps, impell'd by Ruin and Despair,
'Gainst his own life he rais'd an impious hand,
The eye of Justice frown'd, tho' through a tear,
And gave him burial in the public strand.

Rather, perhaps, remote from native home,
Far, far remote from every hand to save,
The grim Assassin pierc'd him thro' the gloom,
And hid him, reeking, in unhallow'd grave.

Or, by pale Want, unknown, unfed, he fell,
No friendly hand to close his hollow eyes,
No Village Clerk toll'd out his passing knell,
No Priest perform'd his funeral obsequies.

Beneath the shelter of that aged Yew,
Commit his relics to their clay-cold bed,
On his poor Bones the closing Earth bestrew,
And venerate the Manes of the Dead.
