At large beneath this floating Foliage laid
Of circling Green, the crystal running by,
(How soft the Murmur, and how cool the Shade!)
While gentle-whispering Winds their breath apply
To 'swage the Fever of the sultry Sky;
Smit with the sweet Sicilian's simple strain,
I try the rural reed, but fondly try
To match his past'ral Airs, and happy Vein:
Lest I assay the Quill of Mantua's Swain
Of bolder Note, and of more courtly Grace:
Ah, foolish Emulation! &mdash; They disdain
My awkward Skill, and push me from the Place.
Yet boast not, Thou of Greece, nor Thou of Rome,
My sweeter COLIN CLOUT outpipes you Both at Home.
