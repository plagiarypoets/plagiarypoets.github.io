The Sun has sunk behind the western hills,
Their rugged tops his last faint rays illume;
From dark'ning flowers, the evening dew distils,
Around the wanderer's path, a sweet perfume,
Betraying still the birth-place of their bloom;
The amorous Bee bids farewell to the Rose,
And hastes its honied treasure to entomb
Within its secret cell; and there repose,
Till the blue sky in morning splendour glows.

Oh!  who could think, to gaze on this still scene,
The deep'ning shade, and the scarce waving flowers,
That here the restless foot of man had been,
Or that rude revel e'er disturb'd these bowers,
To the lone mourner dear in twilight hours;
When nought is heard, save the low-pealing knell,
Ambition prone to daunt, howe'er it towers,
The proudest heart may beat with gentler swell,
Thus warn'd to bid its soaring hopes farewell.
