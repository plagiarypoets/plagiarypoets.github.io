In times like these, when POETRY is dead,
And all the magic pow'rs of verse are fled:
When ribaldry and satire guide the pen,
The shame of Poets, and the bane of men;
What strain Popeian the thick gloom pervades,
And sheds its lustre on those barb'rous shades?&mdash;
See HAYLEY rise, in him at once we see,
Held forth to view the Muse's Jubilee,&mdash;
Whilst imitative nature swells the strain,
Shakespeare in all his magic lives again:
And whilst our bard fair fancy's track pursues,
We trace the dawning of a Spencer's muse&mdash;
Copious as Dryden, and as Pope refin'd,
Bold to expose the follies of mankind;
Witty as Prior, and as Gray sublime,
He lives the motley wonder of his time&mdash;
Proceed, great bard!  in nature's bold career,
Heed not the low'ring of the Critic sphere&mdash;
Since Pope's great self the Archetype of song,
Hath borne th' upbraidings of an envious throng;
Who failing in the character they drew,
Gave to his sterling merit all its due&mdash;
So shall thy muse in late existence thrive,
And midst the storm of ceaseless Critics live!&mdash;
