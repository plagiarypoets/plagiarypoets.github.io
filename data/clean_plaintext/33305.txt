Awake, fair Muse; for I intend
These everlasting lines to thee,
And, honour'd Drayton, come and lend
An ear to this sweet melody:
For on my harp's most high and silver string
To those Nine Sisters whom I love, I sing.

This man through death and horror seeks
Honour by the victorious steel;
Another in unmapped creeks
For jewels moors his winged keel.
The clam'rous Bar wins some, and others bite
At looks thrown from a mushroom favourite.

But I, that serve the lovely Graces,
Spurn at that dross which most adore;
And titles hate like painted faces,
And heart-fed care for evermore.
Those pleasures I disdain which are pursu'd
With praise and wishes by the multitude.

The bays, which deathless Learning crowns,
Me of Apollo's troop installs:
The satyrs following o'er the downs
Fair nymphs to rustic festivals,
Make me affect (where men no traffic have)
The holy horror of a savage cave.

Through the fair skies I thence intend,
With an unus'd and powerful wing,
To bear me to my journey's end:
And those that taste the Muses' spring,
Too much celestial fire have at their birth
To live long time like common souls in earth.

From fair Aurora will I rear
Myself unto the source of floods;
And from the Ethiopian bear,
To him as white as snowy woods;
Nor shall I fear (from this day taking flight)
To be wound up in any veil of night.

Of Death I may not fear the dart,
As is the use of human state;
For well I know my better part
Dreads not the hand of Time or Fate.
Tremble at Death, Envy, and Fortune who
Have but one life:  Heaven gives a poet two.

All costly obsequies away,
Marble and painting too, as vain;
My ashes shall not meet with clay,
As those do of the vulgar train.
And if my Muse to Spenser's glory come,
No king shall own my verses for his tomb.
