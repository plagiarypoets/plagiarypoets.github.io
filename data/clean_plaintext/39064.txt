Adieu, ye scenes of soft delight!
Scarce childhood's happy reign is o'er,
When swiftly fading from my sight,
I view your fairy charms no more.
Adieu, ye pleasing forms divine!
Which fancy bade around me shine,
When fair as summer's cloudlike skies,
Hope's sunny landscape met these eyes,
And health flush'd high my cheek with morning's roseate dyes.

Farewell, ye flowery meads and groves!
Ye lawns, high woods, and cloister'd dells!
Where spring a Sylvan goddess roves,
And nature unmolested dwells!
Ye scenes, which once the Muse held dear,
As listening oft she deign'd to hear
Her votary pour his untaught strain,
When light of heart, and free from pain,
He bade his numbers wild glide gently o'er the plain.

This sickening heart, by grief oppress'd,
No longer glows with genial fire,
No more to mirth a tuneful guest,
I seek to wake the warbling lyre:
Mute are its springs to him who strives,
When sorrow keen his bosom rives,
Joy's blissful passion to refrain,
Wisdom then teach me to refrain,
And hide from public view "Adversity's sad train."
