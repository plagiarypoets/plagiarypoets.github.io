Broomholm, thy vaulted roofs and towers sublime
Yield to the gradual touch of silent Time,
Whose sable stole in dusky mantlings spread,
Veils the fair prospect of thy once-fam'd head;
His robe, full quaint with moss, at random thrown,
Proudly o'erspreads this mansion for his own.
As from the view at late decline of day
Th' expanded lanscape slowly fades away;
Thy beauty thus but dimly now appears,
Thro' the dark backward of a thousand years.
O'er the cold limbs that ever mouldering lie
Beneath the Winter's wind and summer sky,
By the wan moon-beam oft the Bird of Night
Lengthens her feral note, and wings her flight,
The foul bat, rous'd at eve's ill-omen'd hour
Flits from the lonely nook and rugged tower.
What tho' in vain with curious eye we trace
The tarnish'd pourtrait of the sacred place;
With eye profane its fading tints explore,
That mark the features of the days of yore,
And fain would eager snatch from ruffian Time
The hoary fragment of a monkish rhyme:
What tho' no more at early dawn of day,
Eve's lonely hour, or twilight's trembling ray,
With ken full blithe the mariner espies
Thy glittering domes and massy towers arise,
Far from the dizzy mast he looks in vain,
And longs to view his native shore again.
What 'tho' no scanty path we here descry,
To chear with foot of man the sick'ning eye,
Rough from the grasp of age, thy walls deride
The slighter symmetry of modern pride,
Fancy, still fond, presents the long-drawn aile,
And feels the brooding Genius of the pile;
Her magic spell th' emblazon'd arms supplies,
And gives the gorgeous pane a thousand dyes;
Rebuilds the tottering tomb of many a knight
With burnish'd helm and ponderous spear bedight:
Still the damp shrines a grateful awe inspire,
Pale burn the lamps, and rapt th' attentive choir,
Still the loud organ's peal I seem to hear
That wakes the slumb'ring soul, and fills the ravish'd ear.
