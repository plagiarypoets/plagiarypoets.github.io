ERSKINE &mdash; 'tis not thy flowing eloquence
That wakes the artless music of my lyre;
Tho' classic strains adorn thy manly sense,
And MARO'S sweetness, join'd with TULLY'S fire,
In mute attention holds the wondering throng;
Nor would I touch the strings with venal hand,
Nor at Ambition's voice, or Fame's command,
To ill-digested genius tune my song.
I praise thy ardour for those sacred laws
By Freedom's sons revered in ages past,
Thy zeal to vindicate her injur'd cause
From bigot rage and rancour's cruel blast;
Fearless to combat in her honour'd van,
And save from courtly pow'r the noblest rights of man.

When at the ALMIGHTY'S call the world appeared,
He fix'd his choice regard on human kind,
Erected Man above the brutal herd,
By speech distinguished, and a reasoning mind;
Then Language first in Nature's simple dress,
(Ere while by Art embellish'd and restrain'd)
Taught him if pleasure charm'd, or sorrow pain'd,
All the keen feelings of his soul to express;
Tradition next oppos'd her feeble aid,
To check the force of Time's devouring rage,
The hoary grandsire to the youth convey'd
Songs of the Bard, and maxims of the Sage;
Yet her faint traces from the memory glide,
Sunk thro' the lapse of years in Time's oblivious tide.

Egypt, fair Queen of Arts, tho' bow'd so long
Beneath the Crescent's ignominious sway,
On thee, the radiant morn of Science shone,
While Europe's sons in midnight darkness lay;
The hieroglyphic on the massy stone,
The early annals of thy empire bore,
And made thy Sage's philosophic lore
To climes remote and distant peoples known:
Yet not on Pyramids depends thy fame,
Invented letters gave thee nobler praise,
By these we glow with Graecia's patriot flame,
And raptur'd listen to her tragic lays,
Catch the bright vision of the poet's soul,
Or man, the restless wanderer, trace from pole to pole.

But vain the genius of an early age,
And vain the wondrous art of modern time,
If Britain, fir'd by party's heedless rage,
On speculation fix a civil crime:
The Roman's throne no more her sacred boast,
Her sons engag'd in free debate, no more
From Error's mass extract the golden ore,
Truth's radiant prize, that well repays the cost;
Ev'n now Corruption's mist o'erspreads the land,
I see the genius of my country bow,
And as the sorcerer waves his magic wand,
She trembles at a visionary foe;
A phantom dreads, while real ills betide
The cause for which her HAMDEN and her SYDNEY died.

ERSKINE &mdash; 'tis thine, amidst a patriot train,
Whose generous zeal shall wake some nobler lyre,
The injur'd cause of Freedom to maintain,
And fan the embers of her antient fire;
To expand the glowing scene her MILTON drew,
Enlighten'd Sage, who trac'd the searing mind
Unaw'd by pow'r, by systems unconfin'd,
O'er boundless fields of science ever new;
And should some distant age his song rehearse,
Yet lose the music of his heav'nly lore,
When, like old CHAUCER'S tuneless HAYLEY'S verse,
And Fox's eloquence delights no more;
Should varying time obscure thy polish'd phrase,
Yet Britain's latest sons shall own the Patriot's praise.
