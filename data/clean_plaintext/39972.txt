Ye nymphs, who unthinkingly rove,
As merry as crickets at eve;
Beware of Kadanda's false love,
For the shepherd will surely deceive.

I once was as cheerful as you,
And pranc'd like a colt o'er the plain,
While swift as an arrow I flew,
I laugh'd at each amourous swain.

My locks were as black as a crow,
And I dressed like a butterfly gay;
My skin was as white as the snow,
And I sung like a lark all the day.

As unfix'd as the wind, or the weather,
I car'd not a fig what was said;
My heart was as light as a feather&mdash;
But now is as heavy as lead!

For of late as I rambled the grove,
KADANDA I met the mean while;
He gaz'd &mdash; whin'd &mdash; and talked of love,
That I thought his words smoother than oil.

His eyes were as blue as the sky,
And his ringlets were softer than silk;
His bosom was big with a sigh,
And his heart seem'd warm as new milk.

His passion he swore was as strong
As mustard, as firm as a rock,
That his love should continue as long&mdash;
I believed every word that he spoke!

He now has forsaken me quite,
Some other Jemima to follow;
But her favours the traitor will slight,
For his heart like a pumpkin is hollow.

I mourn like a dove all the day,
And my face is grown lean as a rake;
My body is so pined away,
That I'm almost as poor as a snake.

My locks are grown grey as a rat,
Which the swains us'd to praise and admire;
And my eyes are blind as a bat,
And with weeping become red as fire.

Thus flat as a pan-cake I lie,
By love, cruel love I'm undone;
I am sick as a horse, and shall die
For KADANDA, as sure as a gun.
