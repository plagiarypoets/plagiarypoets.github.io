Loved haunt of guiltless hearts and golden hours!
Home of my youth, and theme of youthful song!
How joyous in thy now neglected bowers,
My thoughtless boyhood chased its days along!
Yes, I may roam, a pilgrim in the throng&mdash;
May many a sweet rose in the desert find&mdash;
But ne'er shall twine a wreath, those scenes among,
Home of my youth!  like that I left behind.
Thy warbling brooks, that hush the cradled wind,
Breathe the deep dirge of hopes and pleasures fled;
And, 'mid thy haunted loneliness, the mind
May people vacancy, and list the dead:
The light of days long faded into dreams&mdash;
The rainbow of the past &mdash; still round thee glows and gleams.
