With martial beat I seiz'd the lyre
To sing of wars and conflicts dire,
And valiant heroes slain;
When Phoebus whisper'd with a frown&mdash;
"O ne'er, to please a foolish town,
Attempt the battle-strain.

"To fill the soul with fond alarms,
To sing the pow'r of beauty's charms,
The joys of love and wine,
Shall better far thy Muse become,
Than trumpet, pistol, sword, and drum;
For not a strain can Croker thrum,
To match one Ode of thine.

"Let other Bards in martial verse
The deeds of Wellington rehearse:&mdash;
In numbers light and gay,
Do thou, my friend, Horatius Flaccus,
Record the victories of Bacchus,
A Chief, who if he once attack us,
Is sure to win the day.

"Thy Prince demands his meed of praise,
Attend &mdash; and thou shalt gain the bays,
(The hungry Poet's pray'r,)
For which harmonious Cibber burn'd,
Which haughty Gray indignant spurn'd,
And Dryden blush'd to wear."

Obedient then, I strike the Lyre,
Come, Busby, and my Song inspire,
And all ye rhyming host!
Come, chaste Matilda!  thou whose Muse,
In any sudden dearth of news,
Adorns the Morning Post.

I never touch'd the tuneful string
To laud the virtues of a King,
Or what is more &mdash; create 'em:
With lighter food my friends I treat,
A pun, a tale, a quaint conceit,
Or Scandalum Magnatum.

Then please your Highness, tell my Muse
What sort of character you chuse,
Wise, tender, or heroic?
A Chief, invincible in arms&mdash;
A Lover, fond of beauty's charms&mdash;
A Statesman, or a Stoic?

To do what many Bards have done,
Suppose I blend them all in one!
With compliments in plenty;
And paint you am'rous, wise, and brave,
Chaste, philosophical, and grave,
And call you one and twenty.

Hail, mighty Prince!  illustrious youth!
O listen to the voice of truth,
A voice to Monarchs strange
Thy bright example mends our taste,
Our wives are true, our daughters chaste,
Bear witness, many a slender waist
From Charing Cross to 'Change!

Augustan days are come, we hope,
For Doctor Busby rivals Pope,
And Milton keeps the rear;
Laborious Scott the Laurel gains,
Sir Richard lives in Southey's strains,
And Spencer's Muse, where fancy reigns,
Is distanc'd by a Peer.

See Dibdin, Pocock, Hook, agree,
And Arnold, (no small blockhead he),
The Drama's rights to seize; 
See Op'ras, Farces, all the rage,
And Kemble banish'd from the Stage,
For how can genius charm an age,
Which Shakespear fails to please?

Britannia!  bless thy lucky star,
That gives thee Garrow for the Bar,
And Lancaster to teach;
R&mdash;e for a Ministerial tool,
Intrepid Castlereagh to rule,
And Huntingdon to preach.

My mind, as in a glass, surveys
The glories of thy future days,
To me alone display'd;
Ye years, your happy circles run!
Enough &mdash; the weighty task is done.
And Phoebus is obey'd.
