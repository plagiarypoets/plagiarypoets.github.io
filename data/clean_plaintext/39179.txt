Now Phoebus hastening to his wavy bed,
The western sky bestreaks with liquid gold;
Comes twilight grey, in sober liv'ry clad,
While flocks are seen slow stepping to the fold.

And while Sol hastes our hemisphere to leave,
The woodland choirs chaunt forth sweet tuneful strains,
Till, warned now by dewy-finger'd eve,
The concert closes &mdash; and deep silence reigns.

Save where the bat on leathern pinions borne,
Shrieks, weakly-ey'd, at yon ray's glimm'ring glare;
Save where the beetle winds his sullen horn,
And drony wheels amid the murky air.

Save where the ravens at night's solemn call
(High o'er yon wood whose foliage faintly stirs),
Wheel playful down the dark aerial hall,
And croaking light amid the gloomy firs.

Save where yon team nods tinkling on the way,
Each various scene of dinsome labour's shut,
And the tann'd peasant at the close of day,
Now plods him weary to his homely hut.

His children playing on the level green,
At his approach the fav'rite sport forbear,
Exulting shout, and, O delightful scene,
Run titt'ring, run to meet their parent dear!

Steps he now in &mdash; with what delight he sees
His wife sweet-singing by a shining fire,
The lovely infant dandling on her knees,
That leaps to hail its late-returning sire.

Now Hesperus his paly circlet shows,
Bespangle o'er the sky the starry train,
Lo!  here and there a gem gay-sparkling glows,
While onward Cynthia drives her silver wain.

The jovial reapers in the misty vale,
Unmindful of the labour of the day,
All garrulous rehearse some pleasing tale,
While round this sheety lake I musing stray.

Thrice hail, Contentment!  heav'n-descending fair!
Who kindly crown'st these lab'rer's toil with joy,
May I, like them, thy genial influence share,
And, while I live, a lightsome life enjoy.
