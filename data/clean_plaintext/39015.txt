The Clock strikes nine, the painful hour arrives,
To open Chambers, and the toil begin;
With stomachs keener even than our knives,
We set to work in Furnival's fam'd Inn.

How hard our lot thus doom'd to scribble on
The lazy hours, which our impatience mock,
Hark!  now it strikes &mdash; by Heavens 'tis only one,
Another long hour to come till two o'clock.

At length &mdash; at length arrives th' appointed hour&mdash;
To eat we go, but not to eat a dinner,
Heav'n well knows how little we've th' power
To fill our bellies &mdash; true as I'm a sinner!

Yet some there are, and those a happy set,
Whose purse permits them at the Dive to dine,
See future Judges, Serjeants &mdash; Counsel &mdash; met
Soaking their silver Sweetlips or their wine.

There future Hardwickes, future Talbots, Cokes,
Hales, Blackstones, Wallace's in law profound,
Dispute, harangue, and crack their legal jokes,
In lightsome cellar six feet under ground.

Cases &mdash; Opinions &mdash; Affadavits &mdash; Fees&mdash;
Demurrers &mdash; Judgments &mdash; Executions &mdash; Writs,
There are as thick as leaves upon the trees,
What scope for genius, and what food for wits!

Soon as the labour of the day is past,
Whilst Gray's Inn Bell in gloomy night does ring
Homeward I trudge, but not to feast, but fast,
No pipe &mdash; tobacco &mdash; porter &mdash; no such thing.

At single knock the surly landlord comes
With bosom hard and obdurate as steel;
Each night and morn he insolently duns,
O!  must not he who suffers also feel!
