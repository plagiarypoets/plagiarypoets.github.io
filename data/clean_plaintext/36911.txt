And art thou gone, whom late &mdash; so late &mdash; I knew,
In maiden loveliness and beauty blooming!
And art thou gone, thy bridal wreath so new,
Its primal sweets are still the air perfuming,
While she who wore it, lies beneath, consuming!&mdash;
Thy life was like a dream, or vision fair,
With angel form the captive's cell illuming;
Whose beauties melt into the viewless air,
And leave the waking wretch to weep and wonder there!

And thou art gone! &mdash; I little thought to sing
Thy funeral dirge, dear spirit: &mdash; I, who hung,
As if to heaven's own accents listening&mdash;
With a strange mystic pleasure on thy tongue;
Aye fancying in its tones the syren song
My sick hopes faintly dreamed of! &mdash; I drew near
Once to thy side, and shunn'd the gentle throng:
Ah!  little thoughtful, 'mid that converse dear,
What foes were close at hand: &mdash; thy bridal and thy bier!

Thy breast was a pure haven for the loves,
And virtues, sojourning on earth awhile
Blending at once the gentleness of doves,
And wisdom of the snake, without its guile;&mdash;
Truth on thy lip, and friendship in thy smile.
Sure, thou wert dear to many:  yet sincerer
No heart, than mine, clung to thee &mdash; woe the while:
And oft, I wished that I had known thee nearer,
Yet now, I wish it not &mdash; for then, thou hadst been dearer.
