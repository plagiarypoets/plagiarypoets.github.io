How oft have I tuned my reed
By the banks of this murmuring stream!
How oft! &mdash; but it sure is decreed
I should ever make Phillis my theme.
I will strive to forget her, I cry,
As I pensively wander alone;
Then in spite of myself heave a sigh:
&mdash;Sure pleasure and she are but one.

Unfolded my sheep are by night,
As unheeded they ramble all day:
'Tis an age since she charmed my sight:
How heavily creeps time away!
But fancy will say she is here;
Then I wish to be talking of love:
Alas!  to offend is my fear;
And 'tis strange, but my tongue 'twill not move.

Perhaps then some courage I take;
To the zephyrs I whisper my tale:
And thus do I dream when awake;
But will dreaming, oh Shepherd!  avail?
She sure must be tender, and kind,
Whose looks so much goodness impart:
She smil'd &mdash; but, alas!  I was blind,
Love had taken such root in my heart.

She ne'er on so lowly a swain
Will a smile of compassion bestow;
But sure she will treat with disdain,
Or with coldness will pity my woe.
To say that sincere is my flame,
And that true to her beauties I'll prove;
Ah!  thousands may tell her the same;
For with her there's no feigning of love.

By all that is lovely and fair,
By whatever I value or prize;
By the charms, oh my Phillis!  I swear,
And the language that flows from thine eyes,
Since the time that I viewed thy face,
No pleasure my shrubbery yields;
Both the rose and lilly seem base,
And unheeded the paint of the fields.

My crook I have since thrown away,
My dog and his service forgot;
And my pipe &mdash; oh!  it serves but to play
When I'd fain be consoling my lot.
If to love thee, should favour obtain,
I love more than thou can'st believe;
And if pity should follow on pain,
Oh!  do not refuse to relieve.
