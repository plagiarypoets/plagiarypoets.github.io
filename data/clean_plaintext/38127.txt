On a bleak part of Ireland's shore, the blast
Had wrecked the ship which homewards Usher bore;
From it's torn side the learned Archbishop past,
And went, the desolate region to explore,
If chance should guide him to a friendly door.
Much was his wonder &mdash; much his joy to find,
A churchman's dwelling near the desart shore;
Thither he bent his steps, secure in mind,
To meet from brother-priest relief and welcome kind.

But no!  his hope was vain; the churlish coast
Was not more churlish than the man he sought.
Of name, or rank, but little prone to boast,
The modest prelate had informed him naught;
He merely said, that in God's church he taught,
As consecrated priest, their common creed;
And told the sad mischance which now had brought
Him there to ask relief in direful need.
"A priest," exclaimed the churl, "a hopeful priest, indeed."

"I doubt if thou, unhappy clown, by Heaven
Can tell how many the Commandments be."
"Nay," was the mild reply, "I count eleven."
"Ha!" quoth the priest, "a learned divine I see!
Tell me th' eleventh &mdash; and then I succour thee."
"Obey it, and thou wilt," the Archbishop said;
"A new commandment do I give &mdash; 'that ye
Love one another.'  Is thy love displayed
Refusing thus to me, thy shipwrecked Primate, aid.'"
