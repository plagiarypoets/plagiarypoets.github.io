By the side of the Camberwell road
The beauteous Blowzinda was laid,
With tears were her eyes overflowed,
And most piteously sigh'd the poor maid.

No powder was there in her hair,
No spirit was there in her eye,
She was full, &mdash; aye, quite brim-full of care,
And alas!  could do nothing but sigh!

Young Sixteen-String passing hard by,
And seeing her thus in her dumps,
Tho' he'd got on his cordovan boots,
Ran as if he had been in his pumps.

Ah!  tell me, delight of my eyes,
The shepherd immediately said,
From whence do thy sorrows arise?
Let me be thy confidante made?

Haste, haste, to the Dog and Duck come,
Ah!  hook thy white hand on my arm;
A bowl of new milk and old rum,
Will act on thy heart like a charm.

The FLASHES already are there,
The lights makes a glittering show,
Then away with thy sighs &mdash; not a tear&mdash;
To the winds cast thy care and thy woe.

BLOWZINDA.
Ah!  cease, cease, cease thy fond lay&mdash;
There, there is the cause of my grief,
The licence is taken away,
And my sorrow admits no relief!

This evening &mdash; I spake with a sigh,
At the Horse Guards I took me a hack,
To the Dog and Duck, fellow!  says I,
And away we whirl'd off with a smack.

But to find, when I came to the place,
That the Gentleman's licence was stopt,
The big tear ran down from my face,
And I thought that I there should have dropt.

SIXTEEN-STRING.
Stop his licence!  it never can be!
If they have &mdash; let their Worships take care;
I'll rob them all round, d'ye see&mdash;
But come, my girl, never despair.

I know of another good house,
And to that we will now hike away;
This night we will have a carouze,
And on reckoning the Quorum shall pay.
