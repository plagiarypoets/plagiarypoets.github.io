In lofty strains while Poets sing
The triumphs of the Prussian King,
With equal zeal I join the quire,
And strive to animate my lyre;
But oh! &mdash; in vain &mdash; the strings rebel,
On Love the little traitors dwell:
Rosbach &mdash; immortal Rosbach &mdash; yields
To gentle Love, and Spitalfields.

Frantick with rage, and loss of fame,
I change my strings, and change my theme
To Fer'nand, foremost in the chace
Of Clermont, and his coward race:
My partial lyre in vain I try,
Each accent sinks into a sigh:
To Love the gallant, Fer'nand yields,
To gentle Love, and Spitalfields.

Again I glow &mdash; again essay
To celebrate the glorious day,
When mighty Marlbro' &mdash; more than man!
Pursu'd, O Pitt, thy Patriot Plan:
Alas!  my numbers faintly flow,
In vain I strive &mdash; in vain I glow;
To Love, to Love, the Patriot yields,
To gentle Love, and Spitalfields.

No longer now by glory fir'd,
By Fer'nand, Marl'bro, Pitt, inspir'd
Or Prussia's King: &mdash;  With homage due,
Heroes!  I humbly bend to you;
A softer genius rules my song,
Whose melting magic charms my tongue;
Adieu, ye Heroes! &mdash; Colin yields
To gentle Love, and Spitalfields.

And is it thus? &mdash; thou simple swain&mdash;
Are all thy noble efforts vain?
Then hie thee to thy Rosalind,
And sue the Syren to be kind;
Haply she'll cast a conscious eye,
In pity render sigh for sigh;
While Colin, happy Colin yields
To gentle Love, and Spitalfields.

Yet, if the tyrant turn away,
Nor listen to thy love-sick lay;
No longer nurse the Viper-flame,
But bravely quench it in the Teme:
Perhaps &mdash; she'll drop a brilliant tear;
A mighty boon!  while Colin yields
His Life to Love, and Spitalfields.
