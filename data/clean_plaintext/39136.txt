Where the jessamin sweetens the bower,
And cowslips adorn the gay green,
And the roses refresh'd by the shower
Contribute to brighten the scene,
In a cottage-retirement there lives
Young Colin and Phoebe the fair,
The blessing each other receives,
In mutual enjoyment they share.
And the lads and the lasses that dwell on the plain,
Sing in praise of fair Phoebe and Colin her swain.

The sweets of contentment supply
The splendor and grandeur of pride;
No wants can the shepherd annoy,
While bless'd with his beautiful bride.
He wishes no greater delight
Than to tend on the lambkins by day,
And return to his Phoebe at night,
His innocent toil to repay.
And the lads tell the lasses, in hopes to prevail,
They're as constant as Colin who lives in the vale.

If her lover delighted appears,
The fair one partakes of his bliss;
If dejected, she sooths all his cares,
And heals all the pain with a kiss:
She despises the artful deceit
That is practic'd in city and court,
And thinks happiness no where compleat
But where shepherds and nymphs do resort.
And the lads tell the lasses they die in despair,
Unless they are kind as Phoebe the fair.

Ye swains who're accustom'd to rove,
And each innocent fair one betray;
No longer be faithless in love,
The dictates of honour obey;
Ye nymphs who with beauty are blest,
With virtue improve every grace,
For the charms of the mind, when possest,
Will dignify those of the face.
And ye lads and ye lasses, whom Hymen has join'd,
Like Colin be constant, like Phoebe be kind.
