In vain my fond heart seeks for ease,
Nor ever, I fear, will have rest;
Not beauty, nor harmony please;
Sad care is corroding my breast.

The prospects that gladden the field
With many inspire the gay song;
But to me no such pleasure they yield;
When the heart's not at ease, all seems wrong.

I have stray'd through the city and town,
And enquired wherever I went;
Tell me, youths, (although I'm a clown)
Have ye seen such a lass as CONTENT?

"CONTENT, they replied, lives not here;
Go, shepherd, return home again;
Perhaps, with fair FREEDOM and EASE,
She carelessly sports on yon plain."

I will give the best lamb in my fold,
If you'll tell me which way 'tis she went;
I'd value not silver or gold;
All I wish for is beauteous CONTENT.
