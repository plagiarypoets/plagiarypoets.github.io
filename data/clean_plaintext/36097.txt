There is in this a courtesy and grace,
Illustrious Stafford, that become thee well;
And sweet it is in social life to trace,
Such beams of honour light the modest cell,
Where virtue, talent, genius, love to dwell.
Wise too it is, the lofty elm should twine
Rich wreaths of ivy round her, for they swell
Her summer glories, and when these decline,
Bid winter's cheerless day with glowing foliage shine.

Yes!  rank and fortune own death's winter day,
But he who wore them boasts a just renown,
When, 'mid these fading flowers, the poet's bay
Its leaves immortal weaves into his crown:
And thine shall bloom, when age on age hath flown,
Patron of British art &mdash; benignant Gower!
For many a brilliant gem, too long unknown,
Hath bless'd the kindly influence of thy power,
And placed thy name on high, in Fame's eternal tower.
