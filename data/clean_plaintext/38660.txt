In vain ye seek the warmer Sky,
Where Var rolls down his Alpine Tide,
And Flow'rs unfold their varied Dye,
In earlier Fragrance by its Side,
Ye, whom a Length of well-spent Years depress,
Or wanton Lives whose complicated Ills confess.

Dowdeswell in Vain invok'd the Maid,
Or on the Hill, or milder Dale;
But found her not amid the Glade,
Nor caught her in the whispering Gale;
There &mdash; but such Loss what Time will see supplied!
Britons, your truest, firmest, Patriot-Genius died.

For lo!  with Wreath fantastick crown'd,
She treads this solitary Scene;
And lightly trips these Woodlands round,
Bedeck'd with Stole of verdant Green;
Glides gently down the murmuring Stream below,
And tempers with her Pow'r the ruder Winds that blow.

From Youth, thee, rustick Nymph, I woo'd,
At Ev'ning Grey and crimson Morn,
Thy Steps on Beds of Violets view'd,
And saw thee wanton on the Thorn.
And saw the humbler Shrub and poorer Cell
Thou lov'st, than in th' intemperate Air of Courts to dwell.

But tho' thy Influence benign
To me produce unclouded Days,
Yet true Contentment is not mine,
Unless you claim my Laura's Praise;
And bid her Blood with livelier Impulse flow,
And on her pallid Cheek, the banish'd Roses glow.

From Grief she rescues the Oppress'd,
And drops the sympathetick Tear;
She pours her Balm into the Breast
Of virtuous Indigence and Care.
Thus from corroding Fear and want set free,
She bids them Heav'n address &mdash; then sacrifice to thee.
