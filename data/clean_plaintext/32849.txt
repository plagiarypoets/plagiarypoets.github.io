I know, within my mouth, for bashful feare,
And dread of your disdaine, my words wil die;
I know, I shall be stricken dumbe (my deere)
With doubt of your unpittifull reply;
I know, when as I shall before you lie
Prostrate and humble, craving help of you,
Mistie aspects will cloude your sun-bright eye,
& scornfull lookes oreshade your beauties hewe,
I know, when I shall pleade my love so true,
So stainelesse, constant, loyall, and upright,
My truthfull pleadings will not cause you rue
The ne'er-heard state of my distressed plight.
I know, when I shall come with face bedight
With streaming teares, faln from my fountaine eyes,

Breathing forth sighes of most hart-breaking might,
My teares, my sighes, and me, you will despise,
I know, when with the power that in me lyes,
And all the prayers and vowes that women move,
I shall in humblest mercy-moving wise
Intreate, beseech, desire, and beg your love,
I know, (sweet mayden) all will not remove
Flynt-harted rigour from your rocky breast,
But all my meanes, my sute, and what I prove,
Proves bad, and I must live in all unrest.
Dying in life, and living still in death,
And yet not die, nor draw a life-like breath.
