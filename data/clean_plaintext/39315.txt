Hapless the traveller who in Country Town
Lights at that Inn where the Assembly's held,
Where all attention is thereby absorbed.
More hapless still, if placed beneath the room
Where pipe and tabor, by him partly heard,
Inspire with sprightly mirth the jocund youth,
Whose nimble feet shake the rude window-frame,
That lights the solitary caitiff's room.
There sits he musing on the joys above,
Not to the unknown traveller allowed,
Where the spruce mercer, or the lawyer's clerk,
Once in a month, casting all care aside,
Meets the fair milliner, whose dimpled cheek
Smiles approbation on the gentle squeeze,
Which, crossing over right and left, affords
Occasion to express:  not unobserved
By the grave aunt who sits on bench to spy,
Herself all disengaged, what passes there,
And at next morning's breakfast gravely reads
A solemn lecture, to th' unbelieving maid,
Of simple hearts by Man's false vows betrayed.
Heedless of this, so oft repeated, she
Enjoys the pleasant hour &mdash; and sure 'tis mirth
That well befits the joyous days of youth,
Never condemn'd but by those gloomy souls
That know not, or forget, they once were young.
