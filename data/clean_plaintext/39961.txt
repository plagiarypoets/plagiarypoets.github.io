Meek nature's child, auspicious maid,
With thee to roam the silent glade;
Through flow'ry paths of pleasure stray,
While balmy health adorns the way,
Were better far than tinsell'd toys,
Ambition's vain delusive joys;
Where envy's venom'd shafts prepare
To heap the busy shrine of care,
And ruin, and destruction lies
Conceal'd beneath the dazzling prize.
Oh thou whose soft resistless pow'r
Can sooth misfortune's gloomy hour,
To whom propitious fates decreed
A brighter far, a nobler mead;
When morn his purple wreath renews
With fragrance moist and pearly dews,
Or evening comes in sober grey
To Philomela's parting lay,
Let me thy solemn accents hear,
Soft whisper'd to th' enraptur'd ear,
Whether my wand'ring footsteps stray
Through groves impervious to the day;
Or where the flow'ry fields disclose
The varied beauties of the rose;
Or by the hill, the stream along,
Re-echoing with the shepherd's song.
In spring, in summer's ardent rage,
Or autumn mellowing into age,
Or when collected winter shows
A dreary barren waste of snows,
Guide me to thy sequester'd cell
Wherein the modest virtues dwell;
And in thy philosophic train
Sweet innocence appears to reign;
To live in hope, in pleasure free,
And I will yield my heart to thee.
