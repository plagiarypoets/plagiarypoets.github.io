Companion of the sober hour,
Virtue's best friend and wisdom's aid,
O take me to thy favorite bower!
And hide me in thy deepest shade!
Where scarce the intrusive breezes creep,
Where murmurs die, and echoes sleep,
Where night rolls on her silent car,
Deck'd with the meteor's gleam and the gay evening star

Seek, ye dull souls, the couch of rest,
And there anticipate the grave;
Fly, sensual mortal, to be blest
In passion's storm and pleasure's wave:
But let no foot, impure, profane
Thy still retreats, thy calm domain,
Sacred to those from folly riven,
To those that hate her strife and those that hope for heaven.

Nor will the sordid fool desire
To meet thy shades at evening hour,
Who, dead to all the Muses' fire,
Can neither feel, nor prize their power,
Thy fairy mansions were not built
To harbor ignorance, or guilt;
Polluted is thy virgin breast
Both by the stupid swain and the too vicious guest.

He only, whose seraphic mind,
Wisdom and virtue both pervade,
Will leave the restless crowd to find
Enjoyment in the tranquil shade;
There to give vent, with heart sincere,
To sorrow's or to pleasure's tear;
There, where the good have ever found
Solace to cheer the soul and balm for misery's wound.

Happy the favorite hard, that sings,
A votary at thy heavenly shrine;
Sweet is the rapturous thought, that springs
From inspirations such as thine;
Riches in countless stores are there,
Riches, that wake no torturing care;
Impervious shades their worth conceal:
No moth corrupts them and no thief breaks thro' to steal.

There, from obstreperous life retired,
Our anxious feelings we dismiss;
By hope's or Memory's voice inspired,
We snatch a transient dream of bliss;
There the long-parted friend we see;
The grave restores the dead to thee;
Heaven from above her concourse brings,
And missive angels hover round on golden wings.

O let me live, howe'er unknown,
A friend to solitude and peace;
Nor ever dread to be alone,
In life's declension, or decease
Still towards thy seat my steps I'll bend;
Still in myself I'll find a friend;
Still smile to meet thy lonely gloom;
Nor fear at least the long, long silence of the tomb.
