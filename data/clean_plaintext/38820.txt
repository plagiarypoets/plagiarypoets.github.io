Why was the young Nancy so fair!
Ah!  tell me, ye Shepherds, I pray?
I saw her &mdash; and I must despair&mdash;
She's richer, far richer, than me.

Poor Damon was ever content,
Till Nancy appear'd on our Plain;
Such Beauty by Heaven was sent&mdash;
But why should it wound a poor Swain?

My Lambkins were once my Delight,
I thought myself rich as a King;
No more does their Bleating invite,
To the Tabor no more I can sing.

Nor my Dog I regard as before,
But frown as he kisses my Feet:
I haste to the Eglantine Bower,
And sigh as I feel my Heart beat.

Ah!  if I had Riches in Store,
My Tongue shou'd my Passion declare;
But wishing will never add more,
So Damon must sigh and despair.

And Nancy she never shall hear
The Passion which troubles my Breast;
In Secret shall trickle my Tear,
But Nancy I hope will be blest.
