"Full many a flow'r is born to blush unseen,
And waste its sweetness on the desert air;"
Droops while its tender blossoms yet are green,
Nor finds the gen'rous cultivator's care.

Full many a youth on whom fair science smil'd,
Repress'd by penury, unseen, unknown;
Whose genius cramp'd &mdash; by fortune still beguil'd,
Droops like yon flower, ere yet it is full-blown.

One 'midst the rest by emulation fir'd,
Now seeks the soft'ning hand of wealth and worth,
By modest pride submissively attir'd,
Nor yet forgetful of his humble birth,

To you he bends, nor let him sue in vain;
Be you the cultivator's lenient hand
To raise this drooping blossom from the plain,
And bid its blushing sweetness all expand.

By worth befriended, and by fortune blest,
Let sweet  benevolence exert her pow'r:
Be you th' all chearing sun to warm his breast,
Then mark the progress of an op'ning FLOWER.
