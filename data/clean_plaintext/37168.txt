And well, O Milton!  is thine honour'd bust
Placed these deep shades and twilight glooms among;
For, though far off repose the Poet's dust,
Here lingers still the spirit of his song:
And oft, at eve, these high arcades along,
To Fancy's dreaming eye his form will glide;
While ev'n the depth of stillness finds a tongue,
And sounds unearthly float upon the tide,
Or in faint murmurs die along the dark hill-side.

Yet why, O why, in such a scene is mute
The lyre, which scorns the touch of mortal hand&mdash;
The lyre of Heaven &mdash; the wandering Ariel's lute,
Which fairy fingers all alone have spann'd,
And the pure Zephyr's waving breath hath fann'd?
'Twere sweet to catch its tones when, still and dim,
The beauty-breathing hues of eve expand;
When day's last roses fade on ocean's brim,
And Nature veils her brow, and chaunts her vesper hymn.

Sweet were that sound, at night, to many a band
That beats, with printless steps, the glimmering wave;
Sweetly 'twould linger o'er the moonlight sand,
To him, who loves to tread where waters lave,
And dream of that, which spurns the peaceful grave;
And sweetly would it fill the pauses deep,
When Autumn night-winds cease awhile to rave,
Or in low moanings hush themselves to sleep,
While listening woods and waves a holy concord keep.
