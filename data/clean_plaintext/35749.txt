Heard ye the shepherd's legendary tale,
Under old Mole, in soft Armulla's dale?
Saw ye the villagers around him throng,
Attentive still to hear his rustic song,
And Mulla, list'ning, stop her native speed,
To catch the sound of harmless Colin's reed?
Kilcolman's woods with Colin's carrols ring;
Kilcolman's ruins sad remembrance bring.
Ill-fated swain!  what boots it to have sung
Of knights, of dames, of halls with trophies hung,
Of tournaments and necromantic pow'rs,
And damsels sleeping in enchanted bow'rs,
Fays, giants, goblins, dwarfs of horrid mien,
And all the glories of thy Fairy Queen!
Slow chilling penury, the poet's fate,
And disappointment, on thy evening wait,
Hope for the morrow; evil for the day;
To stoop to those who smile but to betray,
To know of sad dependence all the fears,
To court the bounty of reluctant peers;
From barb'rous spoilers not a remnant save,
Worn down with cares, to sink into the grave&mdash;
Such were the suff'rings of Eliza's bard;
This, Poesy exalted, thy reward!

Flow, Mulla, flow; though Colin be no more;
Though Colin's friend reluctant leave thy shore
To court new smiles, and give his youthful sail
To all the dangers of Ambition's gale;
Yet shall the Muse, sure harbinger of fame,
Give to remembrance injur'd Raleigh's name,
Bid the fond mother tell her infant brood,
When wean'd, they banquet on Columbia's food,
"This, Raleigh planted."  If he proudly calls
England's best bulwark, England's wooden walls;
When new defence, new conquest Britain plans,
Her wooden walls, thus nurtur'd, Erin mans.

Sweet Mulla flow; and, as thy waters glide,
Increase, dilate, till Bregrog's widow'd bride
Shall, join'd to Avenmore's commanding flood
At Youghal, overwhelm full many an ancient wood. . . .
