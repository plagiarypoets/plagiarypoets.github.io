JOY.
See, Shepherds, yon beautiful green,
By the side of yon wide spreading shade;
There the pride of the plain I have seen,
There, ye shepherds, with Phillis I've stray'd.
When Eve with her charms had appear'd,
And the sheep I had shut in their fold,
There with Phillis, my bosom was cheer'd,
To her my soft feelings I told.

Nor heard she my pleadings with scorn,
But return'd her poor Corydon's flame;
She smil'd like the beauty of morn,
When she heard her shepherd's known name.
I deck'd her fair breast with a rose,
When nature its folds had just spread,
When with the bright sun she arose,
And like him her sweet influence shed.

GRIEF.
O Corydon, how envied thy lot!
Sweet Phillis at length was thy bride;
But short was the transporting thought,
Ah!  short was my soon vanish'd pride:
My Phillis was snatch'd from my arms;
My love she now slumbers in death;
No more is that bosom which warms,
No more the rose rivals her breath.

See shepherds, see yonder's her grave,
Where the cypress and willow combine;
They gently their drooping heads wave,
As they weep o'er my Phillis's shrine.
All joy and all comfort is flown,
With Phillis they now lie entomb'd;
That love which for nature I've shown,
Has hardships and sorrow in doom.

RESIGNATION.
Resign'd to misfortune and fate,
Oft Phillis I call to my mind;
The hardships I've suffer'd of late,
Have much the soft feelings refin'd.
I often resort to the grove,
And list to the nightingale's moan;
I oft by the water's side rove,
When the sun has descended his throne.

My crook I once more will resume,
And my pipe, which has long lain aside:
I behold resign'dly the doom
That has my dear partner deny'd.
Your shepherd receive once again,
My sheep which have wander'd astray;
Thou Pow'r who hath eas'd my keen pain,
O teach me thy goodness to pay!
