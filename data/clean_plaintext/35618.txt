Now wakes the poet's strain:  from yonder shades
Methinks I hear the rapturous notes pour'd forth.
O hail!  ye masters of the Lyre!
If, long an alien to your holy rites
Lost I have wander'd, once again admit
A sad repentant votary to your shrines!
From you he seeks for genuine joy; from you
He asks the charm that bids the gloomier depths
Of Solitude to smile, and peoples all
The frowning wilderness with heavenly forms.
O thou, from whose inspired lips arose
The tale of "Fairy castles, of brave Knights
And gentle Ladies &mdash; whose immortal song
Fierce wars, and faithful loves have moraliz'd,"
O say, while haunting savage soils, amid barbaric clans,
Whose discords rude, and yells
Of hideous tone, might e'en appall the hearts
Of stoutest heroes, say, enchanting Bard,
What but the Muse could soothe those anxious days
Of never ceasing peril &mdash; She, who bad
E'en Mulla's murmuring waters, as thou lay'st
Calm on her banks, while Murder stalk'd around,
Nurse thy sweet dreams, and cherish for thy lyre
The brilliant scenes of visionary worlds!
And thou, sublimest Milton, from whose tongue
Flow'd holy inspiration, when beset
With poverty, with sorrow, blame and scorn,
"With darkness and with dangers compass'd round,"
What but the Muse, thy dreary rooms could light
With glories of serpahic brillancy? . . .
