Attend, O ye nymphs and ye swains,
O listen a while to my lay;
Tho' pensive and languid my strains,
Time was I, like you, too was gay;
But now my heart's bleeding with grief,
And pleasure is fled from my sight;
There's nothing can give me relief,
There's nothing can give me delight.

Do ye ask whence my troubles proceed,
Why thus I continue to weep;
And why, scatter'd over the mead,
Unheeded I leave my poor sheep?
Reflect, and ye cannot but guess,
The reason that makes me so dull;
I cannot the cause well express,
My heart, my poor heart is so full.

Don't ye know that my Delia is dead,
That this was the day that she dy'd;
Tho' a twelvemonth is flown o'er my head,
Yet still I my sorrows can't hide;
Yes, e'en in the bloom of her charms,
When crown'd the fair Queen of the May;
Stern death from my eager fond arms,
Alas!  cruelly tore her away.

Ah shepherds and nymphs all so fair!
You knew my dear Delia I find;
For I see in each eye a soft tear,
And trust me I take it most kind;
Your pity her merit makes known,
Wonder not, then, her loss I deplore;
That I never can cease to bemoan,
For she's gone &mdash; I shall see her no more!

They tell me 'tis folly to grieve,
And bid me the pastimes to join;
They may lesser troubles relieve,
But cannot alleviate mine.
Each meadow, each green myrtle grove,
Where oft we together have stray'd;
All a mournful remembrance move,
Of the matchless, engaging dear maid.

Yes Delia, no time can efface,
Thy image impress'd on my heart,
And who knows but a very short space
We may meet again never to part?
Grant this, O ye pitying powers!
For then will my sorrows all cease,
And my anxious corroding sad hours,
Be chang'd for whole ages of peace.
