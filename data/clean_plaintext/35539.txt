Hence ever-eating Care!
That, still unsated, feed'st upon my heart!
What, would'st thou never part?
Of my life's stream thou'st drawn an ample share!
Lurk in some miser's breast!
And with him count his piles of useless gold,
Too numerous to be told:
Make him mistake, and number o'er and o'er
His soul-ensnaring store:
Nor let him ever know a moment's rest!
But, welcome Sport!  of Health the sire!
The infant's, youth's, and man's desire. . . .
