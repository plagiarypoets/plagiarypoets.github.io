Come, serious Contemplation!  fill my breast,
By grief subjected to the pensive sigh:
Let the wild notions of my heart have rest,
And all the flights of syren flatt'ry die.
Others have been unhappy plac'd on high,
And even where the moss-roof'd cottage rose;
Fate's keenest arrows on the poor will fly,
As well as where the trembling vessel bows:
On ALL she looks, and scatters her promiscuous woes.

'Tis not the yellow heaps the miser gains,
Which pile on pile in useless order lie;
'Tis not a birth-day suit, nor all the pains
Corinna takes Myrtilla to outvie,
Nor all the rapture in her lover's eye,
Nor all the honours which the great can share,
Nor all the worlds which learning can espy,
Nor all the flatt'ry which the proud can bear,
Can stop th' impending ill, or drown the voice of care.

In vain are all the arts which cunning tries,
In vain are all the schemes which wisdom lays;
Vain are the dear-bought extasies of vice,
And all th' heroic actions poets praise
In pompous verse and smoothly flowing lays,
And all th' allurements of the courtly train,
And all the monuments which time shall raise,
And all the blessings which the madman feigns,
To ease the soul of woe, or mitigate her pains.

Should I for fame build palaces or domes
Outlasting envy, tow'ring to the skies,
Or visit foreign lands and heroes tombs,
Or sail from whence must rosy Titan rise,
To where, in flaming robe array'd, he dies,
Or to the southern hemisphere should stray,
Or to the piercing north should turn mine eyes,
Where the bleak region scarce admits of day,
Yet care would follow still, and trace the dreary way.

Heroes and kings must to the dye submit,
The greatest and the meanest share one fate;
The son of learning and the child of wit,
Are wretched by men's envy or their hate,
And none can boast a truly happy state.
Since this the fortune then of all below,
The poor, the proud, the peasant and the great,
I'll bear the ill admitted, smile at woe,
And ward with hope misfortune's keenest blow.
