Amintor, how can'st thou refuse
To grant me so small a request;
Why urge you the want of Pope's muse,
Or the Doctor's poetical zest?
I vow tho' their numbers are sweet
And every sentence divine;
Tho' their value I reckon so great,
No less would I set upon thine.

Would'st thou sing of the plain or the grove,
Or lament some unfortunate maid,
The Muses, fair daughters of Jove,
With raptures would readily aid.
What tho' they at first may seem coy,
'Tis but to be closer pursu'd;
They like like other nymphs will comply
When once they are heartily woo'd.

Will nought thy ambition suffice,
But the laurel thy temples to grace?
If still thou resolve to despise
All but the superlative place:
Yet think how the critics in town
Misjudge of poetical fire;
From the skies shou'd Apollo come down,
They'd carp at his heavenly lyre.

If the blind Grecian poet they praise,
'Tis to shew you their skill in the tongue,
Despising Pope's beautiful lays,
And swearing his version is wrong:
But had not that bard of renown,
Their ignorance deign'd to inform,
Of Homer no more they'd have known,
Than if he had never been born.

For me, I disdain to regard
What these trifling censurers say;
If such are denied their reward,
Hope I to speed better than they?
Let my friends but approve of my strains,
Vouchsafing a smile on my song;
Then I'm overpaid for my pains,
Nor value an ill-natur'd tongue.
