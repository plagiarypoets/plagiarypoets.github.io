Fie on the sleights that men devise,
Heigh hoe sillie sleights:
When simple Maydes they would entice,
Maides are yong mens chiefe delights.
Nay, women they witch with their eyes,
Eyes like beames of burning Sunne:
And men once caught, they soone despise,
So are Sheepheards oft undone.

If any young man win a maide,
Happy man is he:
By trusting him she is betraide,
Fie upon such treacherie.
If Maides win young men with their guiles,
Heigh hoe guilefull greefe:
They deale like weeping Crocodiles,
That murther men without releefe.

I knowe a simple Country Hinde,
Heigh hoe sillie Swaine:
To whom faire Daphne prooved kinde,
Was he not kinde to her againe?
He vowed by Pan with many an oath,
Heigh hoe Sheepheards God is he:
Yet since hath chang'd, and broke his troath,
Troth-plight broke, will plagued be.

She had deceived many a swaine,
Fie on false deceite:
And plighted troath to them in vaine,
There can bee no greefe more great.
Her measure was with measure paide,
Heigh hoe, heigh hoe equall meede:
She was beguil'd that had betraide,
So shall all deceavers speede.

If every Maide were like to me,
Heigh hoe hard of hart:
Both love and lovers scorn'd should be,
Scorners shall be sure of smart.
If every Maide were of my minde,
Heigh hoe, heigh hoe lovely sweete:
They to their Lovers should proove kinde,
Kindnes is for Maydens meete.

Me thinkes love is an idle toy,
Heigh hoe busie paine:
Both wit and sence it dooth annoy,
Both sence and wit thereby we gaine.
Tush Phillis cease, be not so coy,
Heigh hoe, heigh hoe coy disdaine:
I know you love a Sheepheards boy,
Fie that Maydens so should faine.

Well Amarillis, now I yeeld,
Sheepheards pipe aloude:
Love conquers both in towne and field,
Like a Tirant, fierce and proude.
The evening starre is up ye see,
Vesper shines, we must away:
Would every Lover might agree,
So we end our Roundelay.
