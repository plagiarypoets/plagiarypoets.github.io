Once more the sun, revolving in his sphere,
Crown'd with his hottest beams in Cancer rides,
Makes smite, O Lackington!  thy lofty sides,
And vegetation owns his fierce career;
But on our breasts his rays no comfort shed,
For far our patriot king, our royal shepherd's fled.

Erst have we seen him tread this healthful plain
Join'd by the rarest partner of a throne;
The ev'ry eye with unknown lustre shone,
For every heart revered a Brunswick's reign.
Near them a virgin train, in mild array,
As ever grac'd a court, or cheer'd the Ides of May.

Ill-fated daughters of a monarch's reign!
Who blest with beauty, sense, and virtue, join'd
With every rare endowment of the mind,
Are born to bloom, and flourish but in vain!
Your sweets are wasted on the desart air&mdash;
Nature brought hope, but courtly etiquette, despair.

Tho' many a heart with noblest honor fraught,
Or sprung from valiant Gaunt's illustrious line,
Warm'd by such beauty might to love incline,
By passion prompted, and by nature taught;
Yet hope must not the downcast eyelid raise,
For them in Albion's realms no sacred altars blaze.

Blest Austrian princes!  were your blessings known,
Whose sceptred powers might lead each yielding hand,
To bless with British blood  your chosen land,
And soothe with love the troubles of a throne,
Their worth instructive would just homage claim,
And Charlotte's beauteous offspring emulate her fame.

Not here again will indigence receive
The timely aid by royal hands bestow'd;
When the pale cheek with sudden transport glow'd,
And the tongue faulter'd &mdash; "King for ever live."
On some far distant shore his hands dispense
The balm of unknown joy, and true munificence.

Watch thou his steps, Hygeia!  heaven-born maid,
Wherever chance or providence may guide,
Be thou th' unseen attendant at his side&mdash;
Breathe on his lips thy salutary aid;
So shall lov'd George see patriarchal days,
And be thine, blooming nymph!  our unremitting praise.
