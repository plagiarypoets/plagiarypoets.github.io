Me thought I saw the Grave where Laura lay,
Within that Temple, where the Vestal Flame
Was wont to burn; and passing by that way,
To see that bury'd Dust of living Fame,
Whose Tomb fair Love, and fairer Vertue kept,
All suddenly I saw the Fairy-Queen:
At whose Approach, the Soul of Petrarch wept,
And from thenceforth those Graces were not seen.
For they this Queen attended; in whose steed
Oblivion laid him down on Laura's Herse:
Hereat the hardest Stones were seen to bleed,
And Grones of buried Ghosts the Heavens did perse.
Where Homer's Spright did tremble all for Grief,
And curst th' access of that celestial Thief.
