In the great hall where martial trophies hung,
Where now the owl doth make her dreary nest,
Oft hath the mynstrel's strain divinely rung,
As oft he play'd before each noble guest,
Infusing generous ardour in each breast:
A transport animateth all around,
Giving to every heart a pleasant zest:
Through passages and lone apartments round,
With loud rebounding force the warlike streams resound.

He'd tellen of great Alfred's warlike fame,
His victories, and eke his learning great;
The terror of his all-victorious name,
Who of the overbearing Danes did beat,
And crush'd their boasted sovereignty and state.
He'd sing the feats of Philip's godlike son,
Great Hector's deeds, and eke his hapless fate;
The mighty actions by great Caesar done,
The prowess of his arm, and victories he won.

And ever and anon he'd shift his lays;
And ever and anon would change his theme:
Now sing in gallant Norman William's praise,
Then celebrate great Coeur de Lion's name;
His dauntless heart, and eke his martial fame;
His shining sword, and eke his golden shield;
The armour which inclos'd his goodly frame;
How well he knew the shining sword to wield,
And make the haughty foe to his great prowess yield.

Oft the domesticks, seated round the fire,
With staring eyne, with look of timide fright,
And hair erect, would tell of goblins dire,
And shadowy forms that stalk about at night.
(Chimeras vaine, and fancies weak and light.)
They start around, with looks of childish fear,
Expecting straight to view some hideous spright;
Eftsoons they fancy some dire phantome near,
And gaze around the place with wild and vacant stare.

But, ah!  no grimly spectre doth appear,
Ne frightfull figure doth astert their sight;&mdash;
Nought but the howling of the wind they hear;
Which doth disturb the silence of the night:
Ne horride form, ne bony, grisly spright,
Enwrapt with winding sheet, distain'd with gore,
Doth harrow up their soul, or cause affright;
Nought can be heard, except the wintry roar,
Driving with furious rage along the dreary shore.
