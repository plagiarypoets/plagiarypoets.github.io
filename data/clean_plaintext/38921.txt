Thou said'st thy hand would gently shred
Spring's first-born child, the snow-drop dear,
From shelterless and lonely bed,
And bring the herald blossom here&mdash;
I would have kissed the lucid thing,
Redeemed from winter's icy wing,
And called thee Love's soft queen protecting timid Spring.

Yet March hath owned a better day,
And nymphs begin to braid the bower;
Yet longing weeks have lagged away,
Nor thou hast come, nor other flower&mdash;
And is it, Mary, sadly true,
That woman's words are but as dew,
Descending all as soft, as soon exhaling too?

Time was, and memory weeps that time,
With other step when wont to move,
I met young spring on mountain clime,
Or roamed the rocks in quest of love.
Then sang my wild harp welcome wild,
Health's sun rose bright, amd beauty smiled,
I was a weak, indeed, but happy, happy child!

That sun hath fled my riper day,
Or feebly gleams, eclipsed and dim;
And who will tooth the sick man's way?
Nor Spring revives, nor flower, for him,
Nor beauty lights his lonely bower;
He weeps away his vernal hour,
Nightly and lone he weeps, like that rath snowdrop flower.

On earth the wretch can lose no more,
O blessed health who loseth thee;
A nuisance cast on life's lee shore,
Like shattered bark, unworthy sea&mdash;
The war-ship's streamers flaunt on high,
The merry pinnace dances by,
Unheeding all of him, there laid alone to die.

Even she, whose sweetly-artless wile,
Might wake a dawn round dark decree,
Withdraws the spring that waits her smile,
Nor deigns to cull a flower for me;
From sickness beauty turns her ray,
And love as lightly wings away,
No solace left me now but harping simple lay.
