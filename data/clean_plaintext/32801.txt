As to the Roman that would free his Land,
His error was his honour and renowne:
And more the fame of his mistaking hand,
Then if he had the Tyrant over-throwne.
So DELIA hath mine errour made me knowne.
And my deceiv'd attempt, deserv'd more fame,
Then if I had the victory mine owne:
And thy hard hart had yeelded up the same.
And so likewise, renowmed is thy blame,
Thy crueltie, thy glorie; O strange case,
That errors should be grac'd that merrite shame,
And sinne of frownes bring honor to the face.
Yet happy DELIA that thou wast unkind,
But happier yet, if thou wouldst change thy minde.
