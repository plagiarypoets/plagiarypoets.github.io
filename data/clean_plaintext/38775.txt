POET.
Old Horace said; and he had wit,
"Poeta nascitur non fit."

FRIEND.
So courtly Horace said; I know it&mdash;
But how came you to be a poet?
Pray what pretence have you to claim
A foremost seat with bards of fame?
You want (excuse me what I mention)
That first great article &mdash; Invention:
Sans Genius, Fancy, Spirit, Fire,
Dare you attempt to strike the lyre?
Believe me, friend, you're very idle
To mount on Peg, and seize the bridle,
A skittish steed!  and to bestride her,
Requires a more experienced rider.

POET.
In spite of all you say, or can,
I am resolv'd to dip my pen
In flowing Aganippe's stream.

FRIEND.
Your's is a visionary dream;
For how can you, in Nature's spite,
And unassisted, dare to write?
Parnassus, maugre all your toil,
You'll find a poor and barren soil,
Pray, did the bards of ancient days
For all their verse get more than praise?
And do not those of modern times,
Poor devils, starve with all their rhymes?
How few could boast of an estate,
Or drove their bays, or eat on plate?

POET.
Had Horace not his country seat?
And did he not superbly treat?
Invite his lordly friends to dine,
And freely give Falernian wine?
Did Virgil not possess a sum
Equal to what we call a plumb?
And not to multiply quotations,
Dan Pope grew rich by his translations.

FRIEND.
All this I grant is very true;
Examples, Sir, so mighty few,
Are no examples, sure, for you.
Can't you remember, when a youth,
Ovid (and he relates the the truth)
Tells us his Sire, from time to time,
Forbad his intercourse with rhyme,
And wisely wish'd him to forbear&mdash;
The Muses were not worth his care:
What could he hope by them to get?
They'd surely run him into debt.
Maeonidas himself was poor,
Chaunting his verse from door to door.
Tho' seated on Parnassus' top,
Our Dryden scarce procur'd a chop!
Ben too had liv'd in snugger quarter,
Had he stuck close to brick and mortar.
Sam Butler too, so full of fun,
The Comick Muse's favour'd son,
Courted her smiles and was undone.
To Spenser riches were denied;
For want pathetic Otway died.
Think of the thousands I could quote,
Who, howsoever well they wrote,
Wanted a dinner and a coat,
Then pr'ythee how can you expect?
Let me entreat you recollect.

POET.
Persuaded by some few to hope
That I in time might rival Pope,
Young as I was, I took the hint,
Ambitious to appear in print;
Like him, "I lisp'd in numbers" too,
And had Parnassus in my view.

FRIEND.
Once more, my friend, employ your time
To better purpose than to rhyme,
Musick and poetry demand
Alike the skilful artist's hand;
Both must be excellent and chaste,
They'll never else please men of taste.

POET.
Convinc'd what you assert is true,
I'll to the Muses bid adieu;
No longer will invoke Apollo,
But some more gainful business follow.
