Object of my fondest care,
'Mid whose gay and childish air,
Pleas'd attention can descry
Reason's dawning brightness nigh;
While she, with delighted view,
Marks thy cheek of rosy hue,
Marks thine eye, whose vivid light
Shines than orient gems more bright;
Marks thy brows serenely bold,
Crown'd with locks of waving gold;
While an inexpressive charm,
More than features, more than form,
Which no pencil e'er could trace,
Heightens every infant grace.
Twice three Summers now have shed
Their warm sun-beams o'er thy head,
Summers, fraught with anxious fears
To reflection's riper years:
While o'er Europe's wasted lands
Discord hurls her flaming brands,
And her rugged arms embrace
Gallia's sanguinary race,
Fixing in each savage mind
Hatred to the human kind&mdash;
Pale experience, all aghast,
Reads the future in the past,
And amidst impending gloom,
Trembles for the nation's doom.
Thee, lov'd boy, no cares molest,
Shade thy brow, or heave thy breast;
Or if cares should discompose,
Like the dew-drop on the rose,
Or like clouds before the wind,
Light, they leave no trace behind.
Genuine delights are thine,
Mirth and innocence divine,
Cherub health of florid hue,
Quick surprise for ever new,
Frolic fancy, gay and free,
Gilds the rapid hours for thee.
Happy age, to grief unknown!
Happy age, but quickly flown!
Soon thy sports thou must resign,
Studious labor then is thine;
Far from every youthful play
Grave instruction points the way:
Science, rich in ancient store,
Spreads for thee her classic lore:
Armed with magisterial rage
Pedants guard the mystic page,
Urging on thy tardy flight
To distinction's steepy height.
Rough is learning's arduous road,
Yet with brightest flowrets strow'd,
Flowrets, 'mid the waste of time,
Blooming in eternal prime.
Poesy, with pleasing guile,
Oft shall chear each graver toil,
And by fiction lead thy youth
To the sense of moral truth.
When, enraptur'd, you rehearse
Matchless Homer's glowing verse,
While his artful muse by turns
Chills with fear, with ardour burns
Melts to pity's softened state,
Or inspires with generous hate;
Let th' instructive tale impart
Virtuous caution to thy heart:
Let the ten-years fatal war
Teach thee early to beware,
Nor to passion's dangerous sway
Yield thyself a willing prey.
Thus, had sensual Paris strove
To o'ercome his guilty love,
Lawless Helen had remained
Honour'd in her native land:
Valiant chiefs, untimely slain,
Had not pressed the hostile plain:
And, undrenched in royal blood,
Troy's illustrious towers had stood.
Oft entranc'd thou shalt admire
Pindar's wild eccentric fire,
Borne on fancy's rapid wings,
Swifter than the theme he sings,
Hesiod, who to thought refin'd
Purity of diction join'd,
Anacreon, whose lyric lay,
Ever graceful, ever gay,
Celebrates in festive scene
Wine's young God, and Beauty's Queen,
Sappho's bright poetic flame,
Of her sex the pride and shame,
Bion, o'er whose laureate hearse,
Moschus mourn'd in sweetest verse,
Theocritus, whose polish'd sense
Shines in simple elegance,
While he paints in valleys green
Joys that wait the rural scene,
Sophocles, of lofty thought,
And the Bard with pathos fraught,
Who recites the direful fate
That attends fraternal hate.&mdash;
O, may ne'er such hate accurs'd
In my children's breasts be nurs'd,
But a mutual constant love
Cheer those ills which all must prove.
Aristophanes combin'd
Brilliant wit and force of mind,
Yet with an indignant rage
Turn from his licentious page,
That to ridicule consigned
Th' ornament of human kind&mdash;
See amid a later age
Plautus charm the Latian stage;
Quick invention's varied mien
Sparkles in each comic scene,
But too oft th' averted eye
Turns from gross obscenity.
Terence chaster, more refin'd,
Pleases and improves the mind:
To complete his polish'd line,
Laelius, Africanus join:
Attic taste his pen revives,
And Menander in him lives.
Rudely learned Ennius sung.
Fair Linternum's groves among;
Yet his energetic strain
Could even Cato's praise obtain.
In Lucretius we lament
Talents lost, and time mispent:
Taught amid Athenian schools
Atheism's pernicious rules,
Idly learn'd, he dares advance
Fairest order sprung from chance,
While confus'dly atoms hurl'd,
Harmoniz'd into a world.
Much Catullus must we prize
Who dar'd Caesar's wrath despise:
Yet more praise should he receive
Who so nobly could forgive.
Mantua's bard sublimely sings
Fates of heroes and of kings,
Or descending to the plains,
Warbles sweet in rustic strains.
Horace points his satire strong,
Or awakes the lyric song.
Ovid's tender lines impart
Subtile poison to the heart.
Soft in elegiac strains
Fond Tibullus' muse complains:
With no vain ambition fraught,
He nor wealth nor honours sought,
Scorning mid a courtly train
Even the imperial smile to gain.
Native energy and fire
In Propertius' lays conspire,
While his fixed and ardent flame
Gives to Cynthia lasting fame.
Vainly the fond muse's love
Deathless wreaths for Gallus wove
By ingratitude debas'd,
He their partial boon disgrac'd.
Hapless Lucan's nervous grain
Paints Pharsalia's sanguine plain.
Gay Petronius could control
Savage Nero's cruel soul:
But too soon his alter'd fate
Sunk beneath the tyrant's hate.
Thus from every age we prove
Vice can never truly love;
For in present as in past,
Virtuous friendships only last.
Juvenal with generous rage
Lash'd the vices of his age;
Yet full oft his nervous thought,
In unseemly language wrought,
Spreads a deeply crimson'd die
O'er the cheek of modesty.
Like him, to satiric Lays
Persius consecrates his days.
But disgusted to behold
Nature in so foul a mould,
Oft we close their list of crimes,
And revert to happier times&mdash;
As in the metallic mine
Purest ores mid basest shine,
Thus in Statius' doubtful page
Beauties mixed with faults engage.
Tho' renown be Martial's due,
With contempt the bard we view
Who, from vanity or fear,
Meanly sooth'd a tyrant's ear.
Claudian's lustre cheered the gloom
That o'erwhelmed declining Rome:
On th' expiring poet's breast
Genius sunk to death-like rest,
Nor again review'd the earth
Till awoke by Dante's birth.
Mid a rude, unlettered age
Dante formed his mystic page;
Hence the obscure and rugged line
Often clouds the work divine;
Yet his self-illumin'd ray
Kindled to a brighter day.
Softest passion, purest fire
Petrarch's moving lines inspire,
While the loves and virtues mourn
With him o'er his Laura's urn.
Ariosto's sportive muse
Fiction's wildest themes pursues,
Tells of necromantic ire,
Stygian sprites, and giants dire,
Knights on flying coursers borne,
Streams inspiring love and scorn,
Beauties fatal to behold,
Paladins and virgins bold,
Who with more than mortal might
Rag'd unconquer'd thro' the fight.
Tasso in sublimer strains
Sings Judaea's hallow'd plains,
Pious Godfrey's spotless fame,
Tancred's unavailing flame,
Guelpho's feats, from whom we trace
Honour'd Brunswick's warlike race,
Young Rinaldo's conquering arms,
False Armida's baleful charms,
And superior to his fate,
Solyman in exile great.
Leaving now each foreign soil,
Turn we to thy native isle;
Genius with a fonder eye
View'd nor Greece nor Italy.
Happy land by nature blest,
In her fairest liv'ry drest!
Mild the suns and pure the gales
That refresh her grassy vales;
Her's are daughters fam'd for charms,
Her's are sons renown'd for arms,
Nor for arms alone:  the mind,
By philosophy refin'd,
Here has fathom'd truths unknown,
And each science made her own.
But more learned bards must name Bacon's,
Newton's, Harvey's fame,
And with unremitting toil
Trace the depth of Locke and Boyle;
While I view with careless eye
Fairer scenes of poesy.
As amid the gloom of night,
When no star emits its light,
Swift the meteor's sudden ray
Gleams a momentary day;
Thus gay Chaucer's mirthful rhymes
Glittered amid barb'rous times
Next descriptive Spenser shrouds
Truth in allegory's clouds;
And in Gloriana's name
Sings Eliza's matchless fame.
Peerless Shakespeare brightly shone
With a splendour all his own:
While with eloquence divine
Nature speaks thro' ev'ry line;
Scorning frigid rules of art,
He enchants the yielding heart,
O'er the subject passion reigns,
Reason charms, and judgment chains,
And with unresisted sway,
Steals each captive sense away.
Jonson's labour'd scenes impart
Less of genius, more of art.
Join'd with Beaumont's friendly name,
Fletcher gains dramatic fame.
One for brighter wit renown'd,
One for judgment more profound.
Loyal Cowley's virtuous mind
Copious wit to learning join'd.
Denham in more measur'd lines
British poesy refines,
Teaching in his nervous page
Skill to the succeeding age.
Strong description, thoughts sublime
Soaring beyond place or time,
Scenes of wonder, terror, pain,
Glow thro' Milton's lofty strain.
Whether his aspiring flight
Joins the dazzling sons of light,
Or amid the infernal reign
Meets the fall'n angelic train,
Or in Eden's blissful groves
With the first of mortals roves,
Awful grandeur still is shewn
Unexampled, and alone.
Lavish wit and humour gay
Crown sarcastic Butler's lay,
Formed to humble and deride
Zealots' hypocritic pride.
Bending with empassion'd mien
O'er pathetic Otway's scene,
Sympathy with streaming eye
Mourns fictitious misery;
For such touching woes are shown
As each breast must feel its own.
Courtly Waller's pollish'd strain
Sacharissa woo'd in vain;
Nor his genius nor his love
Could the scornful beauty move.
High amid the sons of fame
View exhaustless Dryden's name,
Dryden, whose expansive mind
Strength with harmony combin'd
But chill poverty's control
Oft depress'd his vigorous soul;
And indignant we survey
Adulation stain his lay.
Philips in majestic strain
Sings Pomona's cultur'd reign.
Wit and learning blushing boast
Smith, by vile intemp'rance lost.
Easy numbers, smooth and gay,
Sweetly flow thro' Parnel's lay.
Fascinating beauties glow
In the graceful lines of Rowe.
Warmest praises Garth attend,
Poverty's and merit's friend.
Addison's enlighten'd page
Charm'd while it reform'd the age;
There philosophy pourtray'd
Frowns in no forbidding shade,
And mid each perplexing care
Virtue shines divinely fair.
Prior shews how mental worth
Far excels the pride of birth;
For by talents only rais'd,
Courtiers sought him, monarchs prais'd.
Sparkling wit's incessant blaze
Congreve crown'd with early bays.
Pensive Gay repin'd to see
Human hope's uncertainty;
Hope, whose visions, bright as vain,
Still delude, yet still enchain.
In despairing Hammond's lines
With new grace Tibulius shines.
Constant friendship's sacred flame
Still illumines Tickell's name,
Which thro' life conspicuous shone,
Join'd with taste and Addison.
Savage with peculiar fate
Prov'd a barb'rous mother's hate:
From his native honours torn,
Doom'd to calumny and scorn,
Still o'er his devoted head
Want her baleful influence shed:
Yet with a resplendent ray
Genius cheer'd his rugged way,
And when long thro' sorrows led
Life's indignant spirit fled,
Generous pity softening blame,
Gave him to eternal fame.
Bright was Swift's meridian pride,
Harley's friend, and Ireland's guide:
Horrid o'er his closing scene
Gloom'd pale frenzy's haggard mien.
Thus like beauty's fragile prime
Stronger wit must yield to time.
Where does fleeting bliss then rest?
Only in religion's breast.&mdash;
Brilliant fancy, judgment clear,
Melody beyond compeer,
Quick intelligence of mind,
Reason strong, and thought refin'd,
All that genius, all that art
Can of magic force impart,
Varied beauties to display,
Meet in Pope's enchanting lay.
Listening to the tuneful strain
Livid envy frowns in vain,
While warm admiration pays
Tributes of ecstatic praise.
By luxuriant Thomson led
Fancy climbs the mountain's head;
Wanders by pale Cynthia's light
Mid the polar half-year's night,
Where refulgent meteors glow
O'er perpetual hills of snow;
Shuddering from th' impending steep
Views th' unfathomable deep;
Or recoiling from the sight,
Turns where softer scenes invite:
Mid the forest's cool retreat
Shuns the noontide's scorching heat;
Or in the translucent wave
Seems the fervid limbs to lave;
Or mid Afric's sunny vales
Breathes the aromatic gales,
While the dazzled eyes survey
Scenes, exuberantly gay.
Shenstone mid his lov'd retreat
Sung Alcides' lofty fate;
How in early youth his mind
Pleasure's faithless lures declin'd,
And by hardy virtue train'd,
Deathless bliss, and glory gain'd.
Sweetly flow the solemn strains
When desponding Young complains,
Mourning, midnight's deepest gloom,
Fair Narcissa's early doom:
Young, who erst severe and gay
Shone in satire's daring lay.
Akenside in colours warm
Paints imagination's charm.
Careless Churchill's vigorous mind
Pours his satire unconfin'd.
Goldsmith's winning lines impart
Soft benevolence of heart.
Where the moon with glimmering ray
Lights the church-yard's lonely way,
By pale contemplation led,
Moral Gray delights to tread.
Mason with instructive lay
Warns th' ambitious, fair, and gay,
While o'er beauty's sable bier
Admiration drops a tear.
Sense, by studious thought refin'd,
Critic taste, with candour join'd,
Strong discernment, just and clear,
Graceful diction, truth severe,
Piety's seraphic flame
Mark enlighten'd Johnson's name.
Leaving fancy's tuneful train,
Beauties more sublime remain,
Where the holy seers of yore
Pour prophetic wisdom's lore,
And to rapt devotion prove
Heaven's unceasing truth and love.
Whether glowing hymns .reveal
Royal David's fervent zeal,
Or Isaiah's lofty mind.
Threats the ruin of his kind,
Or in softer, sweeter strain,
Jeremiah tells his pain,
While his sad laments deplore
Sion's pristine greatness o'er,
Peerless glories thro' each line
Prove the origin divine.
O may each celestial truth
Influence thy tender youth,
Teach thee every vice to shun
That has hapless man undone,
And thro' error's tenfold night
Lead thee to eternal light.
