The gentlest sound which wakens echo's ear,
In pow'rless numbers breath'd without a guide,
Would fain with modest pleadings now be heard
By thee, O courteous Eve!

Such as some Elfin minstrel lightly pours
In strains symphonious to thy whisp'ring gales,
As o'er the grave where dove-ey'd beauty sleeps,
Soft pity bends and mourns.

Of such as village swains have taught to flow,
With pastoral music in some woodland wild,
Or she, the melancholy bird who sings
Amid thy mantling shade.

O hither come, soft-footed matron Eve!
And whilst proud day-light in his pomp retires,
Dress'd like some pilgrim in his Palmer's weed,
With sober graces come.

And to my sight those pensive charms reveal
Which please me more than all the gaudy hues,
Which Phoebus owns, when o'er the cheek of morn
He flings his colours gay.

O come, and with thy sombre pallet draw
Those dark'ning lines which veil great Nature's face,
And from some holy tower or mountain give
Me, cloister'd nymph, to view

The grey-rob'd landscape stealing slow away,
Where Sylvan spires and lessening groves are seen,
With low roof'd thatches, on whose simple shapes
Thy mild reflection gleams.

Or view chaste Cynthia bend her pearly bow,
And greet thee Evening, with her kisses sweet,
And o'er thy shadowy features smiling throw
Her beams of softest light.

Thee, best belov'd of all the virgin train,
In "sweetly pleasing' numbers teach me how,
Pure Nature's nun, with licence unprofan'd,
To praise thy soft'ning mien.

Which wins more true the feeling's sober turn,
Meek star-ey'd Eve, than all that morning boasts,
When first he waves his orient locks of gold,
Hung with Aurora's pearls.

Still mayst thou smile, calm votaress, placid Eve,
With genial influence thro' earth's varying round;
So shall each season share thy kindliest beam,
And bless thy stedfast reign.
