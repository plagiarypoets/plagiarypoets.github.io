Rotund, or oval, in whatever form,
My jocund eyes thy pleasing presence meet,
Hail, bounteous Pudding!  hot, or cold, all hail!
Whether my blue-eyed Kate, with lily hand,
In simple neatness eminent, whose smile
Is love ineffable, into thy lap
Insueth store of Eggs, and spicy Sweets
Whose fragrance is inferior to herself;
Or whether Joan, in woolly Vestment clad,
Dwelling in Straw-thatcht Cott, with busy glee
Thy composition kneads, and fills thy Cave
With golden Pomes profuse, or leaves thee coarse,
Of Suet, Butter, and aught else devoid
Tending to flavour, serv'd in wooden Bowl.
Oh!  welcome thou, mine Appetite's best Guest;
Whether the Oven's heat embrowns thy Crust,
With Sugar frosted, crumbling at the touch;
Or whether thou in ragged Clout enwrap'd
Hast felt the boiling Tempest of the Pot.
But chiefly come, and deck mine humble Cloth
With all the rich magnificence of Plumbs
Array'd most gorgeously, whilst down thy sides
Hot melted Butter rolls its golden wave,
As amorous of thy charms.  Here might the Sons
Of Luxury deprav'd look on with Eyes
That envy'd, while they gaz'd.  Give me but this,
And let the bloated Alderman devour
Turtle, that boasts diversity of food,
And rarest dainties, still more dainty made,
By being tortured from their native taste.
I shall not grudge their feast.  Be Pudding mine
And I can pass yon celebrated stall,
Where the firm Salmon tempts the greedy eye
Of stopping Passenger, and where the sight,
"Nor cast one longing lingring look behind."
