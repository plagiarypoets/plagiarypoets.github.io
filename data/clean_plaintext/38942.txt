Hush'd were the scenes around; &mdash; a slumbrous dream
Reign'd like the stillness of an autumn day;&mdash;
Each man had yielded to the tranquil sway
Of silent thought; &mdash; when, with a yellow gleam
Like that of an October morn, a stream
Of living fire, with supernatural ray,
Flow'd from the Shepherd's Pipe &mdash; one spark did seem
A wandering comet, ere it died away.
And, like that spark, my feeble morbid spirit
Lingers upon oblivion's dusky shore;&mdash;
But thou, my friend, by nature didst inherit
The robe that SHAKSPEARE, BURNS, and SPENSER wore!&mdash;
Learn to write sonnets, HOGG, and thou shalt merit
Applause, with deathless PETRARCH evermore!
