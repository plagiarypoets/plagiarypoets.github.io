The sun is gliding the luxurious blue
Of the clear morning heav'ns &mdash; the dark leaf'd lime,
The date, the palm, and branch of ev'ry hue
Fruit-hung or bloss'ming in the fragrant clime;
Above, the day is gleaming broad and high&mdash;
Beneath, the ruins of lost Carthage lie&mdash;

The palaces &mdash; adorned capitals&mdash;
The golden lined temples &mdash; each high fane&mdash;
The deities of gold &mdash; majestic halls&mdash;
Throng'd sounding streets; &mdash; and does then nought remain
Of all the wealth, vain mistress of the sea,
Save these few stones to tell the history?

Where are the young and brave &mdash; the ag'd and proud&mdash;
The pow'rless and the mighty &mdash; where the fair?
The cypress zon'd and the noble brown'd,
Whose lips were murm'ring on the summer air?
I ask'd the skies what ravager had come&mdash;
The silent earth? &mdash; the skies and earth were dumb!

The lover moans his tale of griefs &mdash; and dies;
The warrior finds his death on the battle-field;
A kingdom as a village wasted lies&mdash;
A monarch as a slave &mdash; alike all yield:
The pompous monument denies at last
Its feeble voice &mdash; that falls &mdash; is with the past.

Say what art thou &mdash; thus terrible in might,
Who giv'st the young heart bitterness and tears;
Destroying nations in thy clam'rous flight,
Humbling the pride of youth, the strength of years?
Say what art thou &mdash; whose voice was with the birth
Of the new world &mdash; and cursed the infant earth?

The streams flow'd by in loveliness and song,
The flow'rs sprang joyous into radiant life,
The beautiful of air and earth, among
The woods rose up &mdash; the fields in sweets lay rife&mdash;
A paradise where angels might have ranged;
Thou cam'st &mdash; earth trembled &mdash; the new world was chang'd!
