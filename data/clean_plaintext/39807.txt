FAMINE IS DISCOVERED IN A DESOLATED PLAIN IN SWITZERLAND.  TO HER, ENTER FIRE AND SLAUGHTER.

FAMINE.
Sisters, Sisters, who sent you here?

SLAUGHTER.
I will whisper in your ear&mdash;

FIRE.
No, no, no!
Spirits hear what spirits tell,
'Twill make a holiday in hell!
No, no, no!
Myself, I nam'd him first below,
And all the souls, that damned be
Leapt up at once in anarchy,
Clapt their hands and danc'd for glee&mdash;
They no longer heeded me,
But laugh'd to hear hell's burning rafter
Unwillingly re-echo laughter!
No, no, no!
Spirits hear what spirits tell,
'Twill make a holiday in hell!

FAMINE.
Yet, whisper; sister, so and so;
In a dark hint &mdash; soft and low&mdash;

SLAUGHTER.
Letters nine do make his name!
And who sent you?

FAMINE.
The same, the same&mdash;

SLAUGHTER.
He came by stealth, and unlock'd my door,
And I have drank the blood since then
Of thrice ten hundred thousand men!

FIRE AND FAMINE.
Who bade you do it?

SLAUGHTER.
The same, the same,
Letters nine do make his name!
He let me loose, and cried halloo!
To him alone the praise is due.

FAMINE.
Thanks, sister, thanks!  the men have bled,
Their wives and their children faint for bread!
I stood in a swampy field of battle&mdash;
With bones and skulls I made a rattle
To frighten the wolf and the carrion crow,
And the homeless dog; but they would not go:
So, off I flew &mdash; for how could I bear
To see them gorge their dainty fare.
I heard a groan and a peevish squall,
And thro' a chink in a cottage wall&mdash;
Can you guess what I saw there?

SLAUGHTER AND FIRE.
Whisper it, sister, in our ear!

FAMINE.
A baby beat its dying mother&mdash;
I had starved the one, and was starving the other!

SLAUGHTER AND FIRE.
Who bad you do it?

FAMINE.
The same, the same!
Letters nine do make his name!
He let me loose, and cried halloo!
To him alone the praise is due.

FIRE.
Sisters!  I from Hanover came;
Hedge and corn-field all on flame!
Halloo, halloo, the work is done.
And on as I strode with giant strides,
I flung back my head, and held my sides&mdash;
It was so rare a piece of fun,
To see the swelter'd cattle run,
With uncouth gallop through the night,
Scared by the red and noisy light!&mdash;
By the light of his blazing cot
Was many a wretched peasant shot!
Flame met flame and fiercely hist
While crash fell in the roof; I wist
On some of those old bed-rid nurses,
That deal in discontent and curses&mdash;

SLAUGHTER AND FAMINE.
Who bid you do't?

FIRE.
The same, the same!
Letters nine do make his name!
He let me loose, and cry'd halloo!
To him alone the praise is due.

ALL.
He let us loose, and cry'd halloo!
To him alone the praise is due.

SLAUGHTER.
Stay, sisters, stay, I'll tell you more&mdash;
Horrors yet untold before!
Egypt &mdash; deep curses, doleful moans,
Mangled limbs, and dying groans;
The city sack'd, the ravag'd plain&mdash;
Heaps on heaps untimely slain
Not in fight, refusing quarter&mdash;
No, 'twas cool deliberate slaughter
Of the surrender'd unarmed foe!!!
Ha, how the cannon laid them low!&mdash;
But what still remains to tell
Will make the fiends exult in hell,
When they shall learn how neat a trick
He play'd his wounded, and his sick&mdash;
&mdash;Sisters, did you ever hear?

BOTH.
Whisper, whisper in our ear&mdash;
By poison!  he their pains beguil'd!
And calmly lok'd, and calmly smil'd!&mdash;
'Tis true, 'tis true, halloo, halloo!
To him alone the praise is due.

ALL.
He let us loose, and cry'd halloo!
How shall we yield him honour due?

SLAUGHTER.
I'll rouse Revenge, Sedition, Hate,
To hurl him from his high estate&mdash;

FAMINE.
The time shall come &mdash; with lack of food
I'll gnaw, I'll gnaw the multitude;
Till the cup of rage o'er brim&mdash;

SLAUGHTER.
They shall seize him, and his brood,
They shall tear him limb from limb!

FIRE.
O thoughtless beldames, and untrue,
Is this all that ye can do
For him who did so much for you?
He, that so often, by my troth,
Has richly cater'd for you both;
And in an hour, would you repay
Such wonderous work &mdash; away, away!
I alone am faithful!  I
Cling to him everlastingly!!!
