Yes!  let me look a long farewell to thee,
Land of my love!  while now the vessel's prow
Is cleaving through the waters, and I see,
Circling the glorious sky, that radiant bow,
Arc of the Lord!  Hope's Iris here below!
But to this heart no gleam of promise springs,&mdash;
It sadly feels the bitterness of woe.
Oh!  that my soul could soar on morning's wings,
Wafting from earth to heaven its fond imaginings.

But to the clay enchained it must remain;
And from its aspirations may arise
No solace that can cure its deadly pain:
For from the earth it asks no sympathies!
When will it mount and find its native skies?
Yes, when, oh God!  will this lone heart have rest?
When will my spirit fleet? &mdash; It vainly tries,
Panting in thraldom, in my troubled breast,
To waft its path aloft, &mdash; here 'tis a fetter'd guest.

And now another pang throbs through this heart:
From thee, my country!  do I sadly go;
From thee, unmoved, I never could depart;
To sever from thy charms is deepest woe,
But tears are all our heritage below:
And in my pilgrimage of grief and care
To thee, my lyre!  I turn, in high or low;
And whilst the seamen for their path prepare,
My hand strikes out these notes to float upon the air.

Land of my soul! &mdash; the heroes' soil!  I weeping leave thy shore,
And though the lightnings flash around, and loud the thunders roar,
Unheeded are they all by me; their might may still rage on,&mdash;
I only think how lone will be my fate when I am gone.

For when my memory brings to view the scenes I used to love,&mdash;
The river murmuring by my cot &mdash; the bright blue heaven above,
Oh!  wonder not, if deep regret with tears should fill mine eyes,
And my heart be fraught with grief, and the patriot's sobs arise.

Land of my love, &mdash; my hope &mdash; my pride &mdash; of beauty as of worth,
Although I owe thee naught, except that bitter boon, &mdash; my birth;
And, though my young and sorrowing soul long since was sear'd and riven
By injuries that have passed away, &mdash; or pitied or forgiven,&mdash;

Tho' bitter grief hath marked my course, and sorrow wrung my heart,
I cannot, from thy bosom's core, without a tear depart;
It still into mine eyes will spring, and still in sadness flow,
For busy memory must recall thy name, thy tale, thy woe.

And when I sadly muse upon the hero-men of old,
Who led thy fearless children on, the dauntless and the bold,
What bitter pangs awaken, as standing on their graves,
I see their land of glory now but a land of slaves.

The hero's shrine is fallen, and the hero's spirit fled,
The laurel crown no longer wreathes its trophies o'er his head;
His very name is writ in tears &mdash; the tears that nations weep
When, thro' the vista of long years, they call on those that sleep.

How can that voice the dead awake, while the living will not hear?
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

But, lo!  the clouds are veering, and the lightnings flash no more;
The thunders cease their hollow peal, and all their war is o'er;
Wild nature's struggles all are past, while still I weep and mourn,
And sadly view the land to which I never may return.

From the deck I view thy beauties, as the vessel speeds her way:
Into the west the sun has set, the twilight dims the day;
But enough of light remains, oh, thou glorious and thou fair!
For me to gaze upon thy shores, and mark what scenes are there.

Tongue cannot tell, nor pen can say, the rapture of delight
That thrills throughout this bursting heart, as I view thy scenes so bright;
The evening star has risen; her lustre gilds the land,
Shining above the mount and lake, the city and the strand.

I gaze upon those scenes no more!  how could I bear to see
The fairest pearl the ocean wears &mdash; the fairest, yet not free;
And, thinking on the thing she is, and what she once hath been,
How could I calmly look upon her shores and sky serene?

And have the chains, the tyrants bound, grown stronger every hour?
Hath man's heart lost its former glow?  man's arm its former power?
It must be so!  or else long since, the prowess of thy brave
Had flung thy gyves and fetters  as offerings to the wave.

The waves that roll around thee have washed full many a strand,
But none so fair, so green as thine, mine own beloved land!
Well may I weep to leave thee, for I ne'er may seen again&mdash;
In all the strife and toil of life, this Eden of the main.

Yet, as I cast a lingering glance, hope mingles with my prayer,
That freedom's sun may shed his beams o'er thee as free, as fair;
When the minstrel's heart with pride may swell, as, looking o'er the waves,
He sees thy sons who dig no earth for tyrants but their graves!

And if the lyre that here hath given this votive strain to thee
Should ever dare approach the fount of mighty poesy,
Then will my heart remember, that from thee the spirit came
Which could guide my steps through slavery's cloud to the mighty goal of fame.

My country!  this the lowly lay I sing,
My young lyre's trembling echoes die away;
Nor o'er the chords will I my finger fling,
No humbler song must sound from it to-day.
The vessel moves her solitary way;
Thy shores are darkly fading from my view:
But of thy memory naught can work decay,&mdash;
My soul will be imbued with all thy hue,
And oft, tho' far from thee, will dreams of thee renew.
