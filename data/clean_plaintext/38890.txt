Thou Blessing sent from Heav'n, &mdash; design'd
To calm the Torments of the Mind!
Thou Med'cine unto Rage, &mdash; attend,
Give all thy Aid, and prove a Friend:
For oh!  'tis thee alone must give Relief;
Haste, then, to charm my Agony, and ease my Grief!

When fell Disease, corroding Care,
Or slighted Love, do prompt Despair;
When we with furious Passions burn,
And Reason's Empire overturn;&mdash;
Thy balmy Comfort sets our Minds at Rest,
And ev'ry Fear dispels that gnaw'd the tortur'd Breast.

The abject Wretch, confin'd for Life,
Debarr'd of Children, Friend, and Wife,
His Torment cou'd not long endure;
For Death all mental Pangs wou'd cure:
But thou do'st each despairing Thought controul;
Diffusing heav'nly Comfort o'er his drooping Soul.

The Patriot, &mdash; who in Virtue's Cause
Protects our Liberties and Laws,&mdash;
Does unconcern'd behold his Foes
Their Malice (yet conceal'd) disclose;
Conscious of Innocence, from Passion free,
Pursues his Plan with Vigour, and embraces thee.

BRITANNIA'S Sons, who're free and brave,
Will soon subdue the Gallic Slave:
Tho' Traitors wou'd the Crowd mislead,
The Cause that's just will sure succeed:
Then, BRITONS, banish from your Breasts Despair;
Let PATIENCE reign therein &mdash; Success you need not fear.
