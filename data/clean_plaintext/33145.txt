Come forth Laissa spred thy lockes of Gold,
Show thy cheekes roses in their virgine Prime
And though no gemes the decke which Indies hold,
Yeild not unto the fairest of thy tyme
No ceruse brought farre, farre beyond the seas
Noe poisone lyke Cinabre Paints thy face
Let them hawe that whose native hues displeas
Thow graceth nakednesse it doth the grace
Thy Syre no pyick purse is of others witt
Thoise Jewellis be his oune which the adorne
And though thow after greatter ones be borne
Thow mayst be bold even midst the first to sitt
For whilst fair Juliett or the farie quene
Doe live with theirs thy beautie shall be seene,
