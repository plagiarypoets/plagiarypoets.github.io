When fam'd Eliza reign'd, a SPENCER liv'd;
Whose fame almost his Mistress's surviv'd:
And on Great William's glorious acts attends,
One, whom each man, each country too commends;
Fam'd ADDISON, whose worth to all is known,
And by fame's trumpet round the world is blown.
Shall our great Monarch then a Poet want?
And is the English Genius grown so scant?
