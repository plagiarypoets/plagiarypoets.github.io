Hark!  how the demons of intemp'race yell
O'er yon Circean bowl, whose pois'nous fumes,
Involving Reason's seat, to phrensy swell
The reeling sense, and sink the soul in glooms!
Now frantic Mirth the grinning group illumes;
See how her phosphor flash each visage fires!
Riot unrein'd, her midnight pomp assumes,
And roaring nonsense every tongue inspires.
'Tis done!  the furious contest Nature tires;
Oblivious stupor steeps her closing eye;
Yet oft she starts, while dreaming thirst aspires
To catch the fancied potion passing by.
Late morn returns.  Faint Nature wakes again,
Stung with remorse, and agonis'd with pain.
