To you thrise sacred Princesse of this Ile:
By God, By countrie, By true wisdomes praise,
Elect, Annointed, Soveraigne, is the stile,
Religious Empresse, Beautie of our dayes,
His Church you cherish, that your state did raise,
Our peace you purchase, where your throne is plast,
Eternall glorie on your actions stayes;
Rare, Crowned, Vertue:  Holy, Humble, Chast,
Whom all heavens high perfections fully grac't,
Whom all earth honors, should, do, will adorne:
Whom all the Muses have with love embrac't:
Who doth pale Envie, and blind Fortune scorne;
To you wise kings discourse of blisse I bring,
Renowned Queene, true type of happiest King.
