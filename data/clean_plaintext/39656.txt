'Tis vain to muse &mdash; no more the pitying thought,
Nursed in the bosom of soft sympathy,
Shall rise in fond solicitude &mdash; the note
Of harmony shall sound no more &mdash; with me
The sounds of jarring discord best agree;
The oppressor's triumph, and the poor man's wrong,
With jaundiced eye and stern delight I see;
Vain is the aid of lute or soothing song,
I have no future hope &mdash; no fears to me belong.

And what art thou?  A man &mdash; why so am I&mdash;
A rich one &mdash; so I was &mdash; though now as poor
E'en as the veriest wretch that e'er passed by,
Or begged a meagre pittance at thy door.
Yet though my couch is but this rocky floor,
Secluded from the worldling's idle gaze,
And fearing not the iron hand of power,
More true content I feel, than in those days
When fortune shed on me her brightest, richest rays.

More true content!  alas!  I know it not&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

One eve I stood upon the rocky shore,
And marked with joy the gathering clouds of night,
And listening to the ocean's sullen roar,
I hailed the coming storm with fierce delight&mdash;
And though no living object met my sight,
Yet could I hear the sea-bird's piercing scream,
As o'er the foaming surge it came, whilst bright
At intervals the lightning's forky flame
Parted through night's dark vault with sudden, vivid gleam.

Then came the thunder of a distant gun,
Heard indistinctly o'er the roaring wave;
Another came, a nearer, louder one&mdash;
But in that hour no human aid could save;
Each boiling billow oped a yawning grave,
Gaping expectant of its destined prey;
To it were all alike &mdash; the fair &mdash; the brave&mdash;
Who but that morn had been all joyous &mdash; gay&mdash;
The waves that night engulphed &mdash; remorseless swept away.

Then came a sight of horror &mdash; o'er the surge
A little skiff came bounding &mdash; with firm stroke
Their onward course the sturdy rowers urge,
And almost touch the shore, when 'gainst a rock
Their slender bark was driven with fatal shock,
And all were plunged beneath the briny foam&mdash;
The screaming peterel, hovering, seemed to mock
Their dying agonies &mdash; they thought of home
In vain &mdash; the ocean bed is their untimely tomb.

But they are happy &mdash; by that speedy death
Relieved, removed far from this world of pain
And griping misery, while their parting breath
Was consecrate on high &mdash; that death were gain&mdash;
Soul-harrowing thought &mdash; and I must live &mdash; a stain,
A mark to all &mdash; Oh!  that I could shake off
The trammels of this life &mdash; my soul regain
Her pristine purity &mdash; aye!  thou may'st scoff,
But I may reckless bear the scorner's jeering laugh.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Oh!  Anna!  fairest, purest, loveliest, best&mdash;
Yes, thou wast all to me &mdash; thy angel mind
The seat of every virtue &mdash; in thy breast
Was worth with sportive innocence combined&mdash;
And thou art gone &mdash; What!  must I be resigned
Ah no!  I cannot &mdash; yet I cannot weep&mdash;
And must my griefs be to myself confined
And must this heart no more her image keep!
It shall be so &mdash; when I am wrapt in endless sleep.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Days, weeks, months, years, passed on &mdash; I saw thee not&mdash;
And thou wast as one dead to me &mdash; to live
Alone in my remembrance, unforgot
Whilst time endures &mdash; a dreary prospective&mdash;
And my full heart was left alone &mdash; to grieve
O'er dreams of other days, when wanton Joy
On silken pinions came but to deceive,
And spoke of happiness without alloy,
To last while Life endured &mdash; which Time could ne'er destroy.

The dream of days had vanished &mdash; I returned,
And saw thee once again &mdash; still thou wast fair,
Aye, fairer than when first my passion burned&mdash;
The roseate vermeil of thy cheeks was there,
And it was richer, purer, and more clear
Than when I first beheld thee &mdash; but the glow
Of ruddy health was fled &mdash; thy breath was sere&mdash;
The current in thy veins ran sluggish &mdash; slow&mdash;
And fled the cheerful smile &mdash; the spirits jocund flow.

And still thine eyes of beaming blue were bright,
Those radiant orbs which oft in happier hours
Have o'er my inmost soul shed sweet delight&mdash;
Yes, bright as when through * * * leafy bowers
We strayed at silent eve, or mid the flowers
On that green bank reposed, while parting day
In softened splendour, gilt the ancient towers
Of Musgrave's castle with a crimson ray,
And unperceived by us stole on the twilight grey.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

I saw thee yet again &mdash; the vermeil blush
Had vanished from thy cheek &mdash; thy glancing eye
Had lost it's lustre &mdash; and the sickly flush
Of pale disease was there &mdash; yet not a sigh
Of pain escaped thee, but thou wast as I
Should wish to be, resigned, in faith secure
And though it is a painful thing to die,
That pain with constancy thou could'st endure&mdash;
Thy pilgrimage was short, but thy reward is sure.

Spirits of happiness!  which hover round
The peaceful mansions of the blest, where nought
Of sorrow can approach, let the soft sound
Of your ethereal harps be hither brought,
And let them utter each soul-soothing note,
To lull my wounded spirit to repose;
That as their strains around me gently float,
My heart to calm content they may dispose,
And Death steal on at last like sober evening's close.
