Whither quoth shee [muse] to England Damus said.
To England!  quoth shee, no:  that place me traied,
So that none theare loves mee.  Which I knowe by proof,
How they from my deere Spencer stood aloof
When verbale drones of virtuous merit scant,
Suffered that gentile poet die of want:
One onlie knowinge generositie,
And findenge he woold starre for modestie,
Him sent in greatest sicknes, crownes good score,
So Robert Essex did (honors decore).
Nathless of pininge griefe, and wantes decaid
Hee may thank that stowt Earle, yet thus him said,
The medicine comes too late to the pacient!
He died.  And so woold I, if thither went!
Alas!  was that his ende, quoth Damus tho,
I pittie him, yet heareof this I know,
He ha on him bestow'd a funeral,
After the rites of Laureate Coronal
At tgat Tripova laugh'd, naie swore these serive
To dandle poets dead, yeat leave a live
Ne had that cost uppon him binn imploid,
But for my lovinge frend Lodowick Lloyd.

[Heffner, MLN 48 (1933) 223]

Don Lidgate!  Noble Sidney!  Spencer diepe!
By her [November] upcalled arose from deadlie sleepe.

[p. 177; Wells (1972) 162]

So forth she made through the satiric route
fr. Lidgate Spencer Daniel quite lost out
Through soaringe on that high ideal spirit.

[p. 179; Wells (1972) 162]

Spencer because hee had no picture green
Shee bidde goe live in his Faerie Queene.
