Low bending from the starry sphere,
Goddess of Inspiration hear!
Teach (for thou canst) how I may raise
My languid voice, and modulate the lyre,
How I may sound Jehovah's praise,
Mount into Heav'n, and mingle with the sacred Choir.

Fair Gratitude alarms my breast;
And who can chide so soft a Guest?
She bids my willing heart expand
With all that's tender, and with all that's dear;
She bids me bless the pious hand,
That with benificence profuse adorns the year.

Who bids yon fount of orient light
Dispel the darkness of the night?
Who bids the vernal blossoms blow,
Or who commands the loving earth to teem,
Or who POMONA'S treasures grow,
Beneath the kiss prolific of its bridal beam?

'Tis He &mdash; who, terrible in ire,
Rolls round our heads the sheeted fire,
Who sets the winds in wild commotion,
And bids the tempest with impatience rave,
Who rouzes up the sluggish ocean,
Whilst livid lightnings tremble o'er the boiling wave.

The mountains tumble at his nod,
And sick'ning nature feels the God.
The guilty, struck with fear and wonder,
Attempt a dull, faint, momentary pray'r,
When once he grasps the bolted thunder,
And sends it roaring down the precipice of air.

Yet is his parent bounty great,
And passive mercies round him wait:
Or else long since a wrathful blow
Had crush'd the basis of a sinful world;
Or man, to suffer endless woe,
Had in Perdition's ever-burning Gulph been hurl'd.

O Sov'reign of abundant love,
Amidst Archangels thron'd above!
Through ev'ry space of utmost earth,
Be prais'd, be reverenc'd, be glorify'd.
O fit me for my second birth,
And purge me in this transitory state from pride.

And thou, to Bards for ever dear,
Goddess of Inspiration hear!
When e'er my feeble Muse aspires
Of Heav'n, and of Omnipotence to sing,
O warm her with thy genuine fires,
Her harsh, rough notes refine, and prop her daring wing.
