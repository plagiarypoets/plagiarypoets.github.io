Despairing, beside a clear Stream,
A Shepherd forsaken was laid,
And while a false Nymph was his Theme,
A Willow supported his Head.
The Wind that blew over the Plain,
To his Sighs with a Sigh did reply;
And the Brook, in return to his Pain,
Ran mournfully murmuring by.

Alas silly Swain that I was!
Thus sadly complaining, he cry'd;
When first I beheld that Fair Face,
'Twere better by far I had dy'd.
She talk'd, and I bless'd the Dear Tongue;
When She smil'd 'twas a Pleasure too great;
I listen'd, and cry'd while She sung,
Was Nightingale ever so sweet?

How foolish I was to believe,
She cou'd doat on so homely a Clown;
Or that her fond Heart wou'd not grieve,
To forsake the Fine Folk of the Town!
To think that a Beauty so Gay,
So Kind and so Constant wou'd prove,
To go clad like our Maidens in Grey,
And live in a Cottage on Love.

What tho' I have Skill to complain,
Tho' the Muses my Temples have crown'd;
What tho' when they hear my soft Strain,
The Virgins sit weeping around.
Ah Colin!  thy Hope is in vain,
Thy Pipe and thy Lawrel resign;
Thy Fair One inclines to a Swain,
Whose Musick is sweeter than thine.

And you, my Companions so dear,
Who sorrow to see me betray'd;
Whatever I suffer, forbear,
Forbear to accuse the false Maid.
Tho' thro' the wide World I should range,
'Tis in vain from our Fortune to fly;
'Twas Hers to be false and to change,
'Tis Mine to be constant and dye.

If while my Hard Fate I sustain,
In her Breast any Pity is found,
Let Her come with the Nymphs of the Plain,
And see me laid low in the Ground:
The last humble Boon that I crave,
Is to shade me with Cypress and Eugh;
And when She looks down on my Grave,
Let her own that her Shepherd was true.

Then to her New Love let her go,
And deck her in Golden Array;
Be Finest at ev'ry Fine Show,
And frolick it all the long Day:
While Colin, forgotten and gone,
No more shall be talk'd of, or seen;
Unless that beneath the pale Moon,
His Ghost shall glide over the Green.
