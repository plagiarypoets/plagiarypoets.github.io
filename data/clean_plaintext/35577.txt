Britain applauding oft has tun'd the lyre,
To boast how Cowley, Pope, and Milton, sung,
How early Genius wak'd poetic fire,
And pour'd his sweetness on their infant tongue.
A rising Genius such as they has strung
Lately the harp of youth so long resign'd;
We hear with rapture while a Bard so young
Awakes sweet numbers elegant refin'd.
Where polish'd art and fancy have combin'd
To yield that charm the sacred Nine bestow,
What may we hope in future, since we find
From childhood such enraptur'd numbers flow!
Nor is his care alone the classic page,
Bold Archimedian arts his mind engage.
