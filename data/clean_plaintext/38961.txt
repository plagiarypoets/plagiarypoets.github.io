NORTH!  many a time upon thy glory musing,
Mid leafiness, I roam up Hampstead Hill,
When through white clouds Apollo is infusing
Brightness, and milk-maids kneel their pails to fill,
Beside the meek cow ruminant.  I feel
That thou hast beat and buffeted me about,
More than the cook-maid doth an old dish-clout;
Yet I must still admire thee; &mdash; ribs of steel,
Like Spenser's man, are thine; thou carest not
For blows from soft Italian palms like mine.
Since it must be so, brightly mayst thou shine,
And long.  I came to curse, but I cannot;
Therefore, may thy bright fountain never fail,
And Wisdom's long-jerk'd feather o'er thee swale!
