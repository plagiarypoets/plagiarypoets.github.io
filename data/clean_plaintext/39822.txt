Within the commonwealth of trees,
There liv'd, in opulence and ease,
A Willow and a neighbouring Oak,
Two very powerful gentlefolk!
The helm of state was all their aim,
To which they laid an equal claim.
The Willow vain, provok'd at length
The sturdy Oak to try its strength:
The challenge was received in form,
To be decided by a storm.
The God of Storms was now addrest,
The prowess of each side to test.
'Twas granted, as each Willow knows,
And now a furious tempest rose,
That threaten'd, with disastrous fate,
The constitution of the state.
The conscious Willow knew, of course,
That cringing was his last resource,
And bending from the dubious blast,
Evaded all its force at least;&mdash;
While the firm Oak to fury's tide
Opposed its lacerated side;
And scorning meanness, with disdain
Fell prostrate on the groaning plain.
Meantime th' exulting Willow stood,
And claim'd the victory o'er the Wood.
When thus the firm and stately Oak,
In terms of indignation, spoke:&mdash;
"Mean, worthless wretch!  is this thy fort,
Each fickle, favouring gale to court,
And, with insinuating wile,
Of half its force the storm beguile?
Not to thy strength, but frail condition,
Thou owest thy present elevation.
I am an Oak, tho' fall'n, indeed!
Thou still a vile and skulking weed!
Rais'd by no merit of thy own,
But by the blast that laid me prone.
Say!  if thou canst, what plant or tree,
Except a sycophant like thee,
Devoted to intrigue and strife,
Would e'er prefer a dastard's life,
Preserved by guile and crafty saws,
To falling in a GLORIOUS CAUSE.
