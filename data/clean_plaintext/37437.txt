Avaunt, thou Fiend accurst!
Back to thy savage ancestors return,
To dwell for ever with intestine discord,
There where fierce Alaric,
Surrounded by his ruthless Chiefs,
Pollutes the barb'rous feast with social gore.

Would thou hadst perish'd then,
When, beckon'd by the frantic Eremite,
Tancred, and Raymond, and the valiant Godfrey,
Led their accoutered Knights
Against the unknown Saracen,
Dispeopling Europe to waste Asia's plains.

But if thou still wilt stay,
Recall Ordeal, with the glowing shares,
And Tournaments, and Champions sheath'd in iron;
Let such compose thy train:
Offspring of feudal Anarchy!
Thou ne'er shouldst be without thy gothic Sire.

Achaia knew thee not:
When Agamemnon claim'd the bright-cheek'd Maid,
And with rash words incens'd the son of Peleus;
The Hero in his wrath,
Let Hector humble the proud King,
But never ting'd his sword with Grecian blood.

Nor didst thou e'er appear
While Tiber's sons gave laws to all the earth;
Yet much they lov'd to desolate, and slaughter;
Carthage, attest my words!
To glut their sanguinary rage,
Not Citizens, but Gladiators fell.

Slav'ry, and Vassalage,
And savage Broils, 'twixt Nobles are no more;
Vanish thou likewise from enlighten'd Europe;
Be thy wild deeds forgot;
Or only noted in the page,
That we may learn the progress of Mankind.
