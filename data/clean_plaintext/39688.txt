She's gone, alas!  she's gone I know not where!
Now from my eye descends the humid show'r;
Dinah deserved the tribute of a tear;
Have it she shall, tho' 'tis but for an hour.

O thou, who, constant, love's keen shaft repell'd,
And shot resentment from thy single eye,
With dire disdain thy saffron bosom swell'd
In public &mdash; but in private heaved a sigh.

Conscious that cruel Nature had confin'd
Within straight limits thy neglected charms,
All hopes of conquest were at length resign'd,
And death now folds thee in his frigid arms.

"For now, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,"
The single eye that glitter'd in thy head,
The gentle ear that heard the love-taught lay,
Are clos'd, and thou art number'd with the dead.

"Farewell!  a word that has been and must be,"
I sink, beneath the load of grief oppress'd;
Yet why should I lament in vain for thee,
Knowing at least thy body is at rest.

THE EPITAPH.
Here, cold in dust, Aunt Dinah lies,
To crowns of glory may she waken;
Tho', if she meet with such a prize,
There's more than one will be mistaken.
