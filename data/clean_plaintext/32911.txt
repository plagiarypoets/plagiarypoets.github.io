It is not Lord the sound of many words,
The bowed knee or abstinence of man,
The filed phrase that eloquence affords,
Or Poets pen, that heavens do pearce, or can:
By heavie cheere, of colour pale and wan,
By pined bodie of the Pharisay,
A morall eye repentance oft doth scan,
When judgement doth on outward shadows stay,
But Thou (O God) doest hearts intent bewray,
For from thy sight Lord nothing is conceald,
Thou formdst the frame from out the verie clay,
To thee the thoughts of hearts are all reveald,
To thee therefore with hart and minde prostrate,
With teares I thus deplore my sinfull state.
