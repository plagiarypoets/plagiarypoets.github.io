Though my flocks range o'er pastures of Peace,
Crop rich herbage, and quaff the clear stream,
Oft my pipe's too gay carols I cease,
With a sigh &mdash; that their bliss is a dream.

Cruel man!  Ought it not to suffice
That beneath their warm fleeces you glow,
While the food is lock'd up by the ice,
And themselves are half buried in snow?

Who can hear, without anguish, the lambs,
As shiv'ring they bleat in the cold?
Who can see the distress of their dams,
And such fondness unweeping behold?

When I think that fell slaughter, ere long,
Their dear innocent bosoms must stain,
With my griefs I soon finish the song,
Meant at first to enliven the plain.
