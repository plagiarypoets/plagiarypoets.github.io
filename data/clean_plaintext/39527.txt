Happy the man, who in his pot contains
A suet dumplin; he nor feels the pains
Of going dinnerless, nor griping hunger;
But cheerful blows the fire with merry heart,
Often revolving when the happy minute
That brings it to his homely board will come.
Sometimes, with longing eyes, he gazes hard,
And views it boiling in the frothy waves;
Then, with his fork or spoon applied, he feels
And turns it o'er and o'er.  Now time moves slowly on;
The hour-glass, which in yon old corner stands,
Is often view'd; for now his stomach keen,
Gnawing with greedy expectation,
Almost persuades him that the sands are stopp'd.
Now is his table plac'd near the fire,
His cloth of sable hue is spread thereon;
His large clasp knife from out his pocket pull'd
(A knife which oft' has dealt destruction dire
To many a pudding, beef, or whate'er else
Came in its way; for none it spar'd;)
The earthen plate which graces his old shelf
(Which late grimalkin, taking her nightly walks
In search of prey, by dire mishap
Threw down; but, by good care of Fortune,
A piece from out the brim is only broke)
Is straight in order plac'd, and all's compleat.

As when the mariner, who, long from home,
Far from his native land, through seas and storms
And dang'rous perils, homeward does return;
Sudden he sees the wish'd-for port appear,
Joy fills his dancing heart, and now he feeds
His fancy with the pleasing expectation
Of mirth, and joy, and heart-delighting scenes.

Behold the pot has yielded up its store,
And reeking hot is placed on the plate!
The three-legg'd stool is drawn, and down he sits,
Elated with the goodly prospect:  Sudden
His knife, well-plung'd, dreadful incision makes;
And fork, aptly apply'd, his joys compleat.

Now direful devastation does ensue;
And half the delicious morsel is destroy'd
'Ere he can make a pause; which having done,
He smacks his lips, and, liking well the sport,
Proceeds again with more deliberation,
Till of the luscious cates he's made an end.

Thus happy he, envying not sumptuous feasts
Nor courtly entertainments; but, well pleas'd,
Feasts on his homely viands; far happier than a King
He enjoys as full content, without his cares.
