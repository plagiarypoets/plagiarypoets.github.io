Hail to those sacred mansions great and high!
Methinks a glory near each chapel dwells,
Christ's colours streaming there of crimson dye;
Each offering like the balm of Gilead smells,
Which mixt with odorous gums all meaner scents dispels.

Lord, on each holy pile each house of prayer,
Open still open be thy gracious eyes!
Bow down thine ear, be there thy special care;
Who after sun-set, and before sun-rise,
Those benedictions ask, thy bounty ne'er denies.

Let thy good angels still the place frequent;
Send from thy treasures of coelestial grace,
Those gifts thy holy spirit oft has sent;
Send them, blest Father, on that chosen place,
Lift up thy light serene on those that seek thy face.

Thou badst the heavenly meteor take its stand,
Over thy travailing temple in the way;
Where Moses led them through the barren sand;
As thou wert in that meteor, so I pray
Through younder sacred roofs dart thine inspiring ray:

And thou that didst an orient cloud prepare,
To fill that house which fill'd the mouth of fame,
What day 'twas hallowed by its founder's prayer;
Greater than Solomon thou art the same
To shine on those that still invoke thy glorious name.

Whoever there shall thee, dread Lord, adore,
And beg thy pardon with a broken heart;
Prostrate upon the consecrated floor,
That pardon they implore do thou impart,
Every disease from thence and every plague divert.

All who are there with thy blest body fill'd,
And with thy precious blood, good angels fare,
To them against the foe be thou a shield,
They thine own servants, thy sworn servants are,
Let them in endless joys in endless glory share.

Son of the Father, who the world didst frame,
And didst redeem the world with thine own blood,
And tak'st away our sin, O thou the Lamb,
To that blest colony of thine be good,
Wash them from earth for heaven in thy rich purple flood.
