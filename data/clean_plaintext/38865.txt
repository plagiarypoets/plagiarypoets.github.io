Avaunt, red God of blustering Warre,
True glorie rides not in thy echoing carre!
All dropping blode her brighest wreathe,
Thy cruel sword shall ne'er bequeathe
No hosts victorious shout before her;
No rightes asserted bid the worlde adore her;
No, no!  to swell the state of her loved Kings,
No spoiles of murder'd multitudes shee brings.
And now to deck her chosen throne,
On that fair throne, to Britaine dear,
With the flowering olive twined
High shee hangs th' avenging speare;
And there with all the palms of peace combined
Her milk-white hand does pretty posies rear.
To Kings like these, her genuine theme,
The learned Muse her homage pays;
To JAMES, of Kings like these supreme,
She wishes honoured length of daies;
And trims the honest tribute of her laurel'd lays.

'Tis his to bid monastic genius glow,
And teach the regal bounty how to flow
On quaint devices, puns, and learning rare:
And while his sceptre's tutelary sway
The school-disputes obey,
They hail him umpire both and patron King.
'Tis his, to judgment's steady line
Their flights fantastick to confine,
And yet expand their wing;
The fleeting forms of doctrine to restrain,
And bind Schismaticks all in Church's golden chain.
The Church licentious now no more,
From James her great examples takes;
She spurns the toyes of antient lore,
And all in native beauty walks.

While such high end his reigne explores,
Cloisters and Schooles throwe wide our doores;
While from the summits of sublime renown,
He waftes his favoures universal gale,
With those sweet flowrets he adorns his crown,
That bloom in Grammar's humble vale.
What though the deep-tax'd nation groan!
True glorie minds the well-hewn stone,
Church ornaments and organs rare,
And pictures trim and debonnair;
These spread the lustre of domestic praise,
Such be the trophies fit for JAMES to raise:
And Creeds to polish and to teach,
Be this the Monarch's aim;
Above vindictive warr's rude reach,
The Monarch's meed to claim!
