Hold, ruthless peasant!  hold thy lifted arm,
Nor let thy stroke my bleeding rind divide;
Ah!  let my hoary age thy pity warm!
Nor dare to pierce my venerable tide.

Thy axe had echoed through the fertile meads;
The distant vallies spread wild havock o'er;
And shorn the mountains of their fringed heads
From yon tall mansion to the winding shore.

And thou!  of all these fruitful plains the lord,
Avaunt! &mdash; the blasts of winter I've withstood;
And little aid would my old trunk afford,
Now fortune spurns thee in her angry mood.

Thou fool!  'twas lux'ry laid thy honours low,
And ruin comes with delegated power;
Nor would my fall, though thou should'st strike the blow,
Protract his vengeance yet another hour!

In vain did thunders, storms, and winds, and rain,
A thousant years my tow'ring limbs invade!
Thy father's fathers saw them rage in vain,
And found a safe asylum in my shade.

Long have I reign'd the monarch of the woods!
A stately progeny I gave before,
Whose brawny limbs have cleft old Albions floods,
And borne her thunders to each distant shore!

O!  bear my witness Hawke!  Boscawen!  Hyde!
The headlong billows ye have seen them brave;
From where Old Thames pours out his silver tide,
To distant Ganges with her crooked wave!

O!  spare me! &mdash; for thy country too I plead!
Or soon her wrongs shall be reveng'd with mine!
The axe that lopps off my devoted head,
Shall from thy trembling body, sever thine!
