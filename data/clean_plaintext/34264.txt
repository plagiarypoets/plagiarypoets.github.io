Hence, ye irreligious, hence,
Foes to reason and to sense!
Hence the crew whose abject minds
Tyrant susperstition binds!
Seeming hypocrites, that cloak
Heart prophane with pious look!
Atheists, that with scoffing pride
God's creative pow'r deride!
Puritans with solemn face,
Whining cant, and sly grimace!
Hence of ev'ry appellation,
Ev'ry sect, and ev'ry nation!

Come, O come and dwell with me,
White-rob'd nymph, sweet PIETY:
With heavn'ly grace inspire my breast,
Such grace as once those saints possest,
Whose eloquence each hearer charm'd,
And with religious rapture warm'd.
Such TILLOTSON, whose reason shines
Manly in his polish'd lines;
BEVERIDGE, in whose thoughts we see
Nature's sweet simplicity;
SOUTH, who only knew to fit
Sense severe with poignant wit;
Mildly-charming ATTERBURY;
BENTLEY, with a pious fury;
And many a sage, whose silver tongue
Was oft with strong persuasion hung.
Then teach me, nymph, their heav'nly art
To charm and to inform the heart.
So on this earth a deathless fame
Shall crown my ever-honour'd name,
And I in perfect bliss divine
A saint among the saints shall shine.
