O never-sated grave!  in whose embrace
Is hid forever from my joyless sight,
That peerless form, that love-illumined face,
Whose witchery charm'd each demon-woe to flight,
And in adversity's most starless night,
Streamed morning radiance o'er my cherish'd soul;
Nerving its powers, with more than human.  might,
Swaying its movements all with mild controul,&mdash;
My paradise her arms, &mdash; her heart my spirit's goal.

Thy spoil I grudge thee, grave! &mdash; and thee, oh Heaven!
Who, to add splendour to yon bright array,
From form divine, divinest spirit hast riven,
And greedily borne it to thy bowers away.
Ah!  me, full bliss is sorrow's earliest prey:
Surpassing glory, but foretells decline,
Night's sackcloth soon enshrouds the brightest day,
And fields, and flowers, their summer pomp resign,&mdash;
Change is the doom of all, save this fix'd heart of mine.

And oh!  I envy you, &mdash; ye spirits pure,
Who in the blaze of Joy's eternal noon,
Where passion-mists, no darkling soul obscure,&mdash;
Know all the sweets of intellectual boon,
And to love's mellow themes your souls attune,
I envy you the luxury refined,
The nectar of her converse; &mdash; why so soon
To me this balm denied?  oh fates unkind!
Was it too much to grant, &mdash; too much for man to find?

And why, remorseless tyrant!  all-abhorr'd,
Whose breath sheds mildew o'er creations bloom,
Blasting alike the adorer, and the adored,
And quenching beauty's light in envious gloom;
Why must I writhe beneath thy heaviest doom?
Thy dreadest destiny, relentless death!
Why sepulchre my life in Laura's tomb,
And leave me sense enough, and vital breath
To know thy skinny arms her matchless form enwreath.
