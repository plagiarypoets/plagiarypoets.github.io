Deep in a glen, a burnie winds its way,
Where faughs and osiers mirk the face o' day,
A rock hangs nodding o'er its chrystal spring,
And flow'rs, Narcissus-like, its waves o'erhang;
The sun had streak'd the east with purple dyes,
And lav'rocks tun'd the east with purple dyes,
When NELL and SUSAN came to bleach their claes,
"And spread them by the burn upo' the braes."

NELL.
The sun is up, the morning fresh and fair,
"And healthsome it's to snuff the cauler air:"
The gentles, wha in sloth consume their prime,
Ken little o' this pleasant, chearing time.
O come, dear lassie, now our claes are spread,
Aneath this tree we'll find a cooling shade;
"In hartsome cracks we'll pass the hours away,"
Till KATE at dinner brings our curds and whey;
We'll laugh and sing, and a' our secrets tell,
And gif I fail, then nae mair ca' me NELL.

SUSAN.
Fair fa ye, lass; I loo your project weel.
O war my heart as light as it is leel!
Than wad I join, and laugh the hours away;
But as it is, alake and welladay!
It winna do:  but come, let's hear ye tell,
When saw ye ROBIN, and his sister BELL?

NELL.
Yestreen I saw them when we milk'd the ewes,
He drave them to the bught out o'er the knows:
Upo' his reed he play'd, wi' pleasing skill,
"O'er Bogie, and The Lass of Patie's Mill;"
He little ken'd my heart was flight'ring fain.
My winsome lad!  O gin ye war my ain!

SUSAN.
Heh, lass, ye're happy; for he loo's ye weel
As ane wad wiss him, and is true as steel;
Sae dinna vex a heart that is your ain,
But end at anes a wordy wooer's pain.
Had I a joe I cou'd as weel approve,
I wad na lang frae him conceal my love;
But ye are happy, and I'm glad it's sae,
And may rejoice whan ither fouk are wae.

NELL.
"Indeed I'm happy in my shepherd's love,
And haflins own'd I did his suit approve."
Last night he wad convoy me o'er the bauk,
And aunty Madge and Bell were thrang in tauk;
The moon was bright, and stars adorn'd her way,
And twinkling dew-drops made it seem like day;
His words like musick thrill'd thro' a' my heart,
Till at the thorn-tree we were forc'd to part.
Farewell, I cry'd:  farewell, sweet Nell, quoth he;
O dream o' me, as I do oft o' thee!

SUSAN.
Weel, lassie, nane has sic a pleasing art
To cheer my thoughts, and raise my dowie heart;
But gin I war as blest, I'd laugh and sing,
Till a' the hills shou'd wi' my blythness ring.

NELL.
"And what is't ails ye now?  what maks ye sad?"
Are ye in love?  O tell's the happy lad!
Tweel ye ha'e walth to wale on if it's sae;
Sae sigh nae mair, for trouth ye mak me wae.

SUSAN.
"Alake, my friend!  for ye ha'e guess'd o'er true,
And there is naething I'll keep up frae you."
In silent grief my heart consumes awa',
And faithless COLIN is the cause o't a'.
"My father (rest his saul!) has left me gear,"
And a' the chiels about me had a steer;
But what are a' their fleeching tales to me?
COLIN I loo, but them I downa see.

NELL.
And trouth, your COLIN is a winsome lad,
And a' that kens him does his name applaud;
And weel do I wi' a' the lave agree,
Albeit that COLIN war nae kin to me.
Wow but I'm glad, that he has had the art
To please the lass that best deserves his heart;
For dearly does he loo my SUSAN still,
And aft he brags o't to my brither WILL.
Sae let na spitfu' tales disturb your mind,
For love and honour will preserve him kind.

SUSAN.
Ah, na; fair may I rue the luckless day,
That he came o'er the muir to mak the hay:
His lovely shape, and love-commanding een,
"Will be my dead, that shortly will be seen;"
His looks, sae sweetly kind, gade to my heart,
I thought them kind, sae little was my art.

NELL.
And truly did his honest een express
An honest passion in an artless dress:
We a' observ'd it; BELL, and ROB, and me;
His love was plain, we saw't wi' ha'f an ee.
How weel I mind, SANDY, you jo, was there,
And mony a gloom he gae, and mony a stare;
And ROSEY glowr'd wi' jealousy and spite,
And flet on TAM, wha ca'd her his delyte;
While COLIN'S looks were only bent on SUE,
The lasses glowr'd at him, the lads on you.
O!  as we ran about the rucks o' hay!
I hinna seen sincesyne a blyther day.
O' a' your lads, your COLIN loo's you best,
As ev'ry way he far outdoes the rest.

SUSAN.
Sae did I trow, because I wish'd it sae;
Wi' hopes, alake!  we aft ourselves betray:
Whane'er he spake, my bosom felt the sound,
Whane'er he look'd, my heart confess'd the wound.
Sae sweet his voice, whane'er he spake or sung,
I cou'd ha' listen'd ages till his tongue.
My bonny lass!  (quo' he), O tell me true,
Say, can ye loo a lad that ne'er will rue?
Behold, the setting sun that gilds the skies!
O!  whan I'm fause, may it nae mair arise!
O!  keep your aiths, quo' I, but swear nae mair,
Nor doubt a heart that ay shall be your share.
My dearest love!  he cry'd; an' have I thine!
O sweet exchange!  for lang ha'e ye had mine.
But O!  he's fause!  can heav'n sic deeds approve?
Him still I loo, but ROSEY has his love.

NELL.
"Daft gowk:  he loo her!  that's a tale indeed!"
An' ye believ'd it, as it were your creed?
Sic nonsense!  come, and vex yoursel nae mair;
Gin that be't a', ye never need despair;
But bid wi' patience, and ye soon will see,
That COLIN is as true as lad can be.

SUSAN.
Sae wad I hope; but O had he been true,
He wad ha'e come again to see his SUE.
Nae mair, my friend, nae langer use your art,
Nor strive to keep a faithless shepherd's part:
That night he left us, sweer he seem'd to gae,
And aften said, to leave me he was wae.
Farewell, he cry'd, I maun gae o'er the hill,
But I will see ye soon, or tyne my skill.
Wi' sighs he left me, and, wi' langing een,
He glowr'd about him, while I cou'd be seen;
But since that time, he's never anes been here,
An' its sax ouks: &mdash; nae wonder that I fear.

NELL.
Weel, sin' that time the sheep has been to sheer,
And he's been cast to buy the laird a meer;
But had his honour a' the matter kent,
Anither lad I'm sure he wad ha'e sent.
But dear, I wonder that ye dinna hear
The news o' COLIN; &mdash; ye've thought shame to speer.
But here yestreen, whan I was at the mill,
I met wi' JOCK, and his lang brither WILL:
Quo' JOCK, Come here and drink your cousin's health;
He weel deserves't, and has got store o' wealth;
His girning uncle's dead, and left him heir
O' a' his farm; and what wad he ha'e mair?
Now a' the lasses will be setting out,
But SUSAN is the lass, ye need na doubt:
Whan saw ye her?  Faith, we'll drink them baith:
Heav'n prosper them, and keep them ay frae skaith!

SUSAN.
O NELL!  but I be glad to hear he's true;
I ken it's clatter'd, but, O!  what say you?
My COLIN'S love is a' I wish to share;
For warldly gear it never was my care:
The means he's got, I'll fairly tak my aith,
Gi'es me nae joy; I had enough for baith.
And O, my friend!  wi' me he'll share a heart,
As fow o' kindness, as it's free o' art:
If it maun break, nane kens its grief but you,
And while it beats, the ha'f o't is his due.
But time will try, an I maun patient be,
And tak the lot that heav'n ordains for me.

NELL.
Weel,  bide ye lass, but dinna die sae soon;
The thought o't maks me dowff, and out o' tune:
Sic dowie stuff I douna bide to hear,
I hope ye fanna die this mony a year:
COLIN I'll tell the plague ye are to me,
And gar him play, My dearie an ye die.
But yonder KATE comes, rinnin down the path.
At leisure, wean; tak time, and draw your breath.

KATE.
O lasses!  haste ye hame, and mak ye bra,
For WILL and SANDY'S there, and MEG an' a';
ROBIN an' COLIN'S come, an' Piper PATE,
An' BELL an' a's in aunty's o'er the gate:
Sae rin ye're waws, and leave the claes wi' me,
For little TAM'S to steer the speet awee;
The pats and pans are a' upo' the fire,
And GEORDY, bringin peats, fell i' the mire:
The langest table's cover'd i' the ha',
And aunty MADGE ye never saw sae bra:
Young COLIN has a lamb to cousin SUE,
Wi' bells around its neck, wi' ribbons blue:
Mess JOHN'S invited o'er to say the grace,
And mirth and glee appears in ev'ry face.

SUSAN
Blyth news, indeed!  O, had I wings to flee!
My winsome lad, I'd no be lang frae thee.
O haste ye NELL, and let's nae langer stay,
Impatient love but ill can bruik delay.

NELL.
Light hearts will mak light heels:  O!  let's awa';
To see sic friends, what mortal wad be slaw?
Now, SUSAN, never doubt my word again;
An' tak him at his word, he'll be your ain.
What think ye now?  am I a witch, or no?
Atweel I bode nae ill to friend or foe.
Did ye observe, Mess JOHN is to be there?
Say, do ye choose to let your lad despair?
An' if he ask, wad ye refuse your hand?
Faith, tak your will, my lad shall mine command.

SUSAN.
Daft thief!  I dinna ken:  but, O I'm glad!
"And if he's constant, nought can mak me sad."
But bide, that's him that's playing, I am sure,
An' its, The last time I came o'er the muir.
But see!  they a' to meet us kindly rin,
And there's your aunty come to wag us in.
