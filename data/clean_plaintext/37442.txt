How sweet to draw the fragrant breath of morn,
When glorious from the east the rising sun
Dispels th' unwholsome mists
That cloud th' awakening day.

When soft refreshing blows the western gale,
And gently moves th' odoriferous shrub
Impregn'd with silvery dew,
Bright, sparkling to the sun.

While the green verdure, or the leafy wood
Gladdens the eye, and adds new strength to sight;
The vocal feather'd tribe
Melodious charms the ear.

Or from the tangled brake, or whiten'd thorn,
The mellow blackbird joins the softer finch,
While numbers thro' the grove
Make vocal every spray.

The scarce fledg'd brood now try their infant wings,
First flutt'ring, fearful climb the lower boughs,
'Till grown more bold, they soar
From forth the native tree.

Scarce hath the sun the hilly summit gain'd,
And ting'd the mountain tops with burnish'd gold,
When conscious of his ray,
The flocks beat from the fold.

Forth from the deeper vale the mightier herds
Lowing, more loudly hail the glad return,
And crowding numbers haste
To fill the milky pail.

The rosy milk-maid, glowing fresh with health,
Now joyfully resumes her morning care,
And singing, gently strokes
The full distended dug.

Forth from the stable now, the harness'd horse,
Or from his stall the steer, the plowman drives,
To turn the sidelong glebe
O'er many a fallow land.

Now beams with stronger heat the lamp of day,
Drinking with double force the shrinking dew,
And more delightful morn
Gives way to sultry noon.
