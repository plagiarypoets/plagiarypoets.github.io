Act 1 Scene 1:
A FOREST IN ARCADIA.
ENTER A SATYR.

Shepherds fresh, and maidens fair,
Up, and taste the morning air.
See the day spring from afar
Beckons to the weary'd star,
Which all night his course hath run,
To rest him now his task is done.
See, already from the furrow
The shrill lark mounts, and bids good morrow
To the sun, that 'gins to peep
'Twixt the shoulders, slant and steep,
Of yonder mountains.  Up, for shame,
Sloth is shepherds greatest blame.
Now the time is to unfold,
While the dewy drops do hold
On the firm grass; for no rain
Will fall to-day on hill or plain,
Therefore will your flocks feed soon,
And rest them ere the sultry noon.

Shepherds awake!  I hear the horn
Of PAN, beside the babbling bourn,
Sounding to the buskin'd chace,
Which of late our queen doth grace,
With many a fair nymph by her side:
I must hie away, and guide
Their nice steps through the thicket wide,
Lest they err: &mdash; So, swains, adieu!
Maidens chaste, and shepherds true,
All bliss alight on yours and you.
