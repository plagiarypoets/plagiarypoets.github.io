Sweet as the silver voice of victory
Enlarging the fair glory of a king,
Or that lamenting bird, in summer free,
That to the shepherd's thirsty ear doth sing,
As sweet as to divining fancy ring
The golden axles of the circling sphere,
So sweetly is thy praise, on angel's wing,
I mean to soar beyond the solar year:
And there (escap'd into that purer sphere,)
To triumph in the sparkling fount of day,
Thy harbinger, that brightly shall appear
In that celestial walk; as fair as they,
Whom Earth of her heroick race hath sent,
To be her glory, and her argument!
