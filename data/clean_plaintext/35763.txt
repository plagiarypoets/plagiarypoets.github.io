Harp of the South!  that never mouldering hung,
But daily by a Sylvan touch doth sing;
And hath thy numbers on soft zephyr flung,
'Till joyous listners did around thee cling,
Musing in ecstasy on ev'ry string:
Oh, happy harp!  ne'er let thine accents sleep!
Though pleas'd to hear the James a murmuring,
Still let thy sweeter sounds its silence keep,
And let a votarist smile, who'd frequent cause to weep.

'Twas thus in ancient days of Caledon,
The lyre was foremost mid'st the happy croud;
When lay of mutual love, or glory won,
Arous'd the lover, or the warrior proud:
And each accordant theme was struck aloud.
Then to its strains sublime and high,
Fair maids and plumed chiefs enraptur'd bow'd,
Well pleas'd the burthen of the minstrelsy,
Was knighthood's dauntless deed, and beauty's matchless eye.

Oh, strike once more!  and to thy happy hand,
Its magic numbers pleas'd obey;
Oh, strike once more!  and let thy skill command,
Those touching accents, of thy Halcyon lay;
Enchanting sweet, that ne'er may die away;
And always worthy of thy happy strain:
The, then my heart, enraptur'd at its sway,
Beats to a touch that ne'er was vain,
Then silent never be!  Enchantress!  strike again!
