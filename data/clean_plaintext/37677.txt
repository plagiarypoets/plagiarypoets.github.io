Shrouded in liquid light, and robed in gold
On Apalachia's brows I rear my throne;
There all the effulgence of my power unfold,
And reign great empress of a prostrate zone.
Inspir'd by sacred raptures I survey
My consuls bursting into life and day,
To gild mine annals with immortal fame;
While all the Hesperian climes with reverence own
Mine awful fasces, mine imperial gown,
And vaunting Europe deigns to venerate my name.

I see my Scipio's thunderbolts of war
On realms unknown my trophied pillars rear,
Wreathed with the laurel bear mine arms afar,
And strike some Indian Hannibal with fear:
I see my Pompeys through the freezing North
Arm'd with my thunders pour my legions forth,
And bid some tawny Mithridates flee,
Chain quiver'd heroes to their car of state,
And teach great sovrans wondering at their fate,
A braver empire blooms, and claims the subject knee. . . .
