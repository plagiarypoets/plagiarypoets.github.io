The minstrel bards of Albion's elder days,
Too long have ceas'd to trim their with'ring bays;
In vain, obedient to the clarion's call,
They cheer'd the banquet in the banner'd hall:
Warton to life restores the tuneful train,
Wakes the lost rhyme, and strings their harps again;
His skilful hand unlocks the fairy vale
Where auncient genius plann'd the knightly tale;
He shews the wreaths, ting'd with romantic hue,
Of old to valour and to beauty due.
