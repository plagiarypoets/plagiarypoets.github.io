The chariot of the queen now mov'd along,
With six postilions, a strange motely throng.
The master-groom was mounted on an ass,
And slow the beast, and slow the rider was;
His looks betray'd the dulness of his soul,
His clothes were shabby and his shirt was foul.
His stockings folding down his ancles hung,
From a capacious mouth roll'd out his tongue.
The loss of buttons kept his bosom bare,
His eyes flood fixed in a vacant stare.
His only pouch, his cards and dice preserv'd,
His spouse had broke her heart, his children starv'd.
Left by his father with a large estate,
His folly soon had forc'd the frowns of Fate;
If want of care can rank us with the blest,
He of all mortals happiness possest.
Reflection never wrung his heart with pain,
Nor stirr'd the standing puddle of his brain;
From danger of a jail though never free,
Surety for all who sought his help was he.
His poorest friend had lent him more or less,
For every day produc'd some new distress;
When tradesmen bawl'd, he hush'd them with a song,
Nor guess'd if their demands were right or wrong.
And when his breeches got an hundredth rent,
He laugh'd to see his taylor's patience spent. 
Nor health in early walks the sloven sought,
Nor knew the nobler exercise of thought;
By day he stroll'd the current lie to hear,
And loung'd, and gam'd, and read the gazetteer.
And when the listless day began to close, 
With brother vagrants, soak'd his ev'ning dose.
He never went to sleep till twelve at night, 
Nor twice in twenty years rose with the rising light,
But always eat his breakfast in his bed,
Unless compell'd to steal before he fed.
The want of toil his useless nerves unbrac'd,
And purse, and person, sunk with equal haste;
The dream of reformation died in words,
That precious fruit which Idleness affords.
