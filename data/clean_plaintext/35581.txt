Let spring diffuse her richest sweets around,
With flow'ry chaplets deck the smiling year,
And hail this day with double honors crown'd&mdash;
This day to genius, love, and friendship dear.
Friendship, and love, his natal day revere,
Genius exulting, claims him for his son,
This too his nuptial, when bless'd Hymen near,
Bade lovely Nancy hail him for her own.
Could my first wish but reach th' empyreal throne,
This two-fold festive day should oft return,
Till full of years when life's full current's run,
Enjoy'd 'midst health, they drop to fill one urn.
Their happy souls to heaven exulting rise,
To share with kindred spirits, purer joys.
