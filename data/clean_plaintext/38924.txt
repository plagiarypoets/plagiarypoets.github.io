Mine ear hath heard a sound &mdash; a stifled cry
Of distant sorrow; up from th' abyss of time
Springs the sad wail of helpless agony&mdash;
The laugh of scorn, the scoff, the ribald rhyme,
The fearful consequence of lust and crime:
O sin hath crushed a heart that went astray
From the right path, and with her serpent slime
Of pleasure daubed it, hideously gay,
The surer thus to gorge and batten on her prey!

Stay, mortal, thy career!  and ere the hour
Of retribution comes, that comes to all,
O let Repentance use her saving power
To free thy soul from miserable thrall&mdash;
Call with a warning voice, nor vainly call:
Then shall the bonds of vice apart be riven;
And angels, when they see thy shackles fall,
Almost &mdash; so great the joy will be in heaven&mdash;
Wish they had sinned like thee, to be like thee forgiven.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Wouldst thou learn wisdom?  seek it not
In the hermit's cell or the peasant's cot;
For the hermit's cell, though far it be
Away from the world's impurity,
Holds but little of earthly good
Beyond the charm of its solitude;
As the flower that springs in desert ground
Looks only bright for the waste around:
And the lowly cot of the peasant, though long
It hath Paradise seemed in the minstrel's song,
Hath its ample share of wants and woes
When clothed in reality's humble prose.
Turn away, then,
From the path that leads
To the mountain glen
Or the flowery meads;
Come when the moon her beauty discloses
Over thy garden-bower of roses;
Come not in fear or in company.
With a trembling heart and a tearful eye,
But, harmed not the more, nor guarded the less,
Come alone in thy gentleness,
And spread thy little white hand to me&mdash;
Thou shalt be taught by palmistry.

There is a line upon thine hand&mdash;
Deeply, deeply that line is traced;
Ne'er hath the eye of futurity scanned,
Ne'er hath the finger of Providence placed
On mortal mould
A type that told
Of half the sum of human bliss
As, in characters known
To me alone,
Is graven in letters of light on this.
Thou shalt be happy, for happiness flies
Ever round the fountain of light divine,
That is fed by the streams of virtue which rise
With sparkling radiance in hearts like thine;
And if ever sin
By chance should win
A wish or a thought for her guilty store,
Thy memory cast
To the times then past,
Remember the Sibyl, and sin no more.
