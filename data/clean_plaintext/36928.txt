Nor list I crave the gentle Readers prayse,
Nor make base prayers to the Critick eares,
Nor humbly beg for undeserved bayes,
My bolder Muse no cruell censure feares:
Let starveling Poets and that baser sort,
To wrested favour witles heads exhort.

Nor doe I feare those Scyllaes dogged heades,
Which still are barking at the passingers;
And sate their thirstie jawes on worthier deedes,
Scorning the bones of threedbare carrion verse:
My Muse shall flie those Basilisks aspect,
Which with their poysned rayes all things infect.

The sixteenth spring had with her flowrie vaile
Wrapt all the earth, warm'd with th' approching Sunne,
And did gainst winters ragged force prevaile;
Who streight to cold Cocitus streames did runne:
Where in congealed frost for deepe disgrace,
He wilfull hides his blushing hoary face.

When I too yong doe drive this chariot,
Plowd up the furrowes of my fruitles wit,
And in this spring this timely child begot,
And to mens favours now adventure it:
Where let it hazard for more lucky chance,
And with his worth his humble name advance.

Where infant flie the lowring browes of age,
Avoyd the wrinkles of his furrowed face,
Thy state fits not their graver carriage,
But to the yonger sort direct thy pace:
Where while thou sitst thy loved peeres among,
Bid them or not correct or mend thy song.

And fly the earthly poets servile soule,
That sels the Muses for each peasants brasse;
Those mercenaries faults thou maist controule,
Whose deeds fayre Helicons sweet streames debase:
And thou more glorying in immunitie,
Fly farre the name of prentise-poetrie.

Next scorne the scorner of a Poets pen,
That counts it base in tuned lines to sing,
And leaves it for the poore and needy men,
That hope to gaine by rimed flattering:
Tell him not all Parnassus yet is sold,
But yet one head the lovely Muses hold.

Which heav'nly Sydney living did adorne,
And Scottish James bedeckt with princely writ,
Whose names black envy and deaths force doe scorne,
Eterniz'd with the glorie of their wit:
Whose hallowed steps not to be troden more,
Following a farre full humbly I adore.
