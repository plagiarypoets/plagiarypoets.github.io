His brutal Pow'r let the proud Stoick prize,
To quell the native Feelings of the Heart,
His savage Fierceness may I still despise,
Nor hide my Tears, or woe-fraught Bosom's smart.

Alas my DORILAS, my worthy Friend!
For thee shall I forbid the Tear to flow?
For thee, who in thy Prime hast met thine End,
Nor give a loose to unaffected Woe?

When I recall the Hours with thee I've pass'd,
Thy genuine Wit, the Goodness of thy Heart,
Thy Judgment, and thine elegance of Taste,
The Tear unbidden from my Eye will start.

Cultur'd with Care, how like some Flow'ret bland,
That shines at Morn most elegantly gay,
Thy Genius rear'd by Education's Hand,
Bloom'd just to shew its Worth and then decay!

Lost is the frequent Labour of each Hour,
Which you to sacred Industry did give,
To cull with Care from ev'ry classic Flow'r
Their honied Elegance for thine own Hive.

Where many a Water-Nymph her Streamlet leads
O'er verdant Lawns, or thro' the tufted Grove,
Amidst the chearful Verdure of the Meads,
Together daily we were wont to rove:

Sometimes, we from the Cherwell's winding Stream,
Brought the bold Pearch with Pleasure to the Shore,
Adieu ye Hours which erst I did esteem,
Ye happy Hours which can return no more.

Delusive Hope oft promis'd but in vain,
Tho' we were parted we again should meet,
That I should hear thy pleasing Strains again,
Where even Virtue's self appears more sweet:

But now, delusive Hope can charm no more,
No more I on her Promises depend;
A Fever comes, and I at once deplore
The Poet lost &mdash; the Poet, Man, and Friend.
