RECITATIVE ACCOMPANY'D.
Why do the Gentiles tumult,
And the Nations muse a vain Thing,
The Kings of the Earth upstand with Pow'r,
And Princes in their Congregations
Lay deep then Plots throughout each Land,
Against the Lord and his Anointed?

CHORUS.
Let us break off by Strength of Hand,
And cast from us, no more to wear
The twisted Cord and iron Band;
Him or his God we scorn to fear.

RECITATIVE ACCOMPANY'D.
O Lord, how many are my Foes?
How many that in Arms against me rise,
That of my Life distrustfully thus say,
No Help for him in God there lies.

Chorus repeated, Let us break off, &c.

AIR.
Jehovah, to my Words give Ear,
My Meditations weigh,
The Voice of my Complaining hear,
To thee alone, my God and King, I pray.

Chorus repeated, Let us break off, &c.

RECITATIVE.
The Highest, who in Heav'n doth dwell,
Shall laugh them to Scorn:
The Lord shall speak to them in his Wrath,
And in his fell and fierce Ire trouble them:
For I, saith He, have anointed Him my King,
(Tho' ye rebel) on Sion's holy Hill.

AIR.
O who shall pour into my swollen Eyes
A Sea of Tears, that never may be dry'd;
A brazen Voice, that may with shrilling Cries
Pierce the dull Heav'ns, and fill the Air so wide;
An iron Frame, that Sighing may endure,
To wail the Misery of the World impure?

AIR.
Fly from the threat'ning Vengeance, fly;
Ere it is too late
Avoid your Fate,
The Bolt once thrown, ye surely die:
Put not your Trust
In the Unjust,
Who lift their Heads so high.

Fly from, Da Capo.

RECITATIVE ACCOMPANY'D.
Humbled with Fear, and awful Reverence,
Before the Footstool of his Majesty,
Throw thyself down with trembling Innocence,
Nor dare to cast thy weak, thy dazzled Eye
On the dread Face of that great Deity,
For fear, lest if he chance to look at thee,
Thou turn to nought, and quite confounded be.

AIR.
His Scepter is the Rod of Righteousness,
With which he bruise shall his Foes to Dust,
And the great Dragon strongly doth repress
Under the Rigor of his Judgment just:
His Seat is Truth, to which the Faithful trust:
From whence proceed her Beams so pure and bright,
That all about him sheddeth glorious Light:
His Scepter is the Rod of Righteousness,
With which he bruiseth all his Foes to Dust.

AIR.
Be wise at length, ye Kings of averse,
Be taught, ye Judges of the Earth,
With Fear Jehovah serve.

CHORUS.
Be wise at length, ye Kings averse,
Be taught, ye Judges of the Earth,
With Fear Jehovah serve:  Or brought full low,
With iron Scepter bruis'd, and then dispers'd,
Scatter'd like Sheep, ye perish in your Way.

RECITATIVE.
Of many Millions the populous Rout,
I fear not, tho' incamping round about
They pitch their Tents against me,
My God will rise, my Help is in the Lord.

AIR.
Jehovah is my Shield, my Glory;
Him thro' my Story
Th' Exalter of my Head I count;
Aloud I cry'd,
He soon reply'd,
And heard me from his holy Mount:
I lay and slept, and wak'd again,
The Lord himself did me sustain.

Jehovah is my Shield, &c.  Da. Capo.

RECITATIVE.
Fools or Madmen stand not within my Sight,
All Workers of Iniquity thou hat'st,
And them, unblest, thou wilt destroy;
The bloody and guileful Man thou dost detest.

CHORUS.
God found them guilty, let them fall,
By their own Counsels quell'd,
Push'd them in their Rebellions all,
For against him they had rebell'd.

PART THE SECOND.

AIR.
Oh!  Liberty, thou choicest Treasure,
Seat of Virtue, Source of Pleasure;
Life without thee knows no Blessing,
No Endearment worth caressing.

RECITATIVE.
Who trusts in God shou'd ne'er despair,
The Just are still the Care of Heav'n,
Rejoice, my Soul &mdash; Jehovah hears.

AIR.
Prophetick Visions strike my Eye,
In vain our Foes for Help shall cry:
War shall cease,
Welcome Peace,
And triumphs after Victory:
The hostile Band,
By his right Hand,
O'erthrown, affrighted leaves the Land.

Prophetick Visions, &c.  Da. Capo.

CHORUS.
May God, from whom all Mercies spring,
Bless the true Church, and save the King!
With firm united Hearts we all
Will conquer in his Cause, or fall.

May God, &c. Da. Capo.

RECITATIVE.
The Lord hath heard my Pray'r,
Mine Enemies shall all be blank and dash'd
With much Confusion; then grown red with Shame,
They shall return in haste the Way they came,
And in a Moment shall be quite abash'd.

AIR.
Then will I Jehovah's Praise
According to his Justice raise,
And sing the Name and Deity
Of Jehovah, the most High:
Ever let my Thanks endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

CHORUS.
All his Mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

AIR.
How great, and many Perils do enfold
The righteous Man, to make him daily fall,
Were not that heav'nly Grace doth him uphold,
And stedfast Truth acquit him out of all!

DUET.
After long Storms and Tempest overblown,
The Sun, at length, his joyful Face doth clear;
Thus after Fortune's Rage is shown,
A blissful Hour at last is known,
Else would afflicted Man despair.

RECITATIVE ACCOMPANY'D.
To God our Strength sing loud and clear,
Sing loud to God our King,
To Jacob's God, that all may hear
Loud Acclamations ring.

AIR.
Prepare the Hymn, prepare the Song,
The Timbrel hither bring;
The chearful Psaltery bring along,
And Harp with pleasant String.

CHORUS.
Prepare the Hymn, prepare the Song,
The Timbrel hither bring;
The chearful Psaltery bring along,
And Harp with pleasant String.

AIR.
He has his Mansion fix'd on high,
Above the Reach of Mortal Eye:
Who by his Wisdom did create
The painted Skies, so full of State,
And did the solid Earth ordain
To rise above the watry Plain:
Who, by his all-commanding Might,
Did fill the new-made World with Light;
Then caus'd the golden tressed Sun,
And the horn'd Moon, their Course to run.

CHORUS.
Hallelujah, your Voices raise,
Jehovah, Lord of Hosts, to praise.
Hallelujah.

PART THE THIRD.

CHORUS.
I will sing unto the Lord,
For he hath triumphed gloriously,
The Horse and his Rider hath he thrown into the Sea.

CHORUS.
Who is like unto thee, O Lord, amongst the Gods?
Who is like thee, glorious in Holiness,
Fearful in Praises, doing Wonders?
He gave the Egyptians Storms for Rain.

CHORUS.
He gave them Hailstones for Rain,
Fire mingled with the Hail ran along upon the Ground.

AIR.
When warlike Ensigns wave on high,
And Trumpets pierce the vaulted Sky,
The frighted Peasant sees his Field
For Corn and Iron Harvest yield,
No pasture on the Plain appears,
And rural Joys are chang'd to Tears.
Be calm, and Heav'n will soon dispose
To future Good our present Woes.

RECITATIVE AND AIR.
The Enemy said, I will pursue,
I'll overtake, I will divide the Spoil,
My Lust shall be satisfied upon them.
I will draw my Sword,
My Hand shall destroy them.

AIR.
The Sword that's drawn in Virtue's Cause,
To guard our Country, and the Laws,
Friend, Parent, Children dear;
To guide its Edge we Heav'n invoke,
Rebellion falls beneath the Stroke,
And Joy succeeds to Fear.
Millions unborn shall bless the Hand
That gave Deliv'rance to the Land.

CHORUS.
Millions unborn shall bless the Hand
That gave Deliv'rance to the Land.

RECITATIVE AND AIR.
When Israel, like the bounteous Nile,
For Egypt's Lords enrich'd the Soil,
The Streams our gushing Eyes supply'd
Increas'd the River's swelling Tide.

AIR.
Tyrants, whom no Cov'nants bind,
Nor solemn Oaths can awe,
Strove t' enslave the free-born Mind,
Religion, Liberty, and Law:
Its own Vicegerent Heav'n ordains
To free the World, and break th' Oppressor's Chains.

RECITATIVE, AND AIR, AND CHORUS.
May balmy Peace, and wreath'd Renown,
The virtuous Hero ever crown!
May Bliss eternal be his Share,
Whose God and People are his Care!

ANTHEM.
Blessed are all they that fear the Lord.
God save the King!
Long live the King!
May the King live for ever!
Hallelujah, Amen.
