'Twas at the Grocer's feast, for power won,
By Chatham's second son;
Aloft, in City state,
The youthful hero sate,
A sugar loaf his throne.
His nurs'ry friends were plac'd around;
Their chins with bibs, their brows with puddings bound;
(So children shou'd in place be crown'd:)
The lovely Dundas, by his side,
Sate like a bonny &mdash; Eastern bride,
In full-blown pow'r, and Scottish pride.
Happy, happy, happy pair!
None but the Scotch,
None but the Scotch,
None but the Scotch deserve such fare.
CHORUS.
Happy, &amp;c.

Sir Watkin, plac'd on high
Amid the City quire,
With Canadian singers touch'd the lyre:
(For fear of itch, none, by the bye,
Wou'd, after, touch the wire)
The song began from Jove;
Who left fair Windsor's heights above,
(Of mighty power such is the love)
As on Ambition's paths he trod&mdash;
Temple and Jenkinson deceiv'd the God:
"Pow'r is not gain'd by tyranny profess'd,
A secret influence must be possess'd:"
Then, in his closet, the fair Nymph he sought,
The harlot Influence, with her to sport,
And stamp an image of himself, an emblem of the court.
The list'ning Cits admire the lofty sound;
A back door minister they shout around,
A back door Minister the Grocer's Hall rebound.
With ravish'd ears
The Premier hears,
Approves the plan,
Affects the man,
Unmindful of his years.
CHORUS.
With ravish'd, &amp;c.

The praise of drinking, then, the Welch Musician sung;
Of Gower and Weymouth, neither very young:
The jolly dogs in triumph come,
Sound the trumpet, beat the drum;
Lost to all shame and grace,
They shew their double face,
Now give the hautboys breath, he comes, he comes,
Rutland, never fair, but young,
Drinking joys can best explain;
Rutland's blessings are a treasure,
Drinking is his Grace's pleasure:
Sweet the treasure,
Damn the pleasure,
Pleasure does not suit this reign.
CHORUS.
Rutland's blessings, &amp;c.

Sooth'd with the sound, young Pitt grew vain,
Spoke all his speeches o'er again;
And thrice confuted all his foes, and thrice he rack'd his brain.
Sir Watkin saw the madness rise,
His fluent tongue, and scornful eyes,
And while he North and Fox defy'd,
Stop'd his mouth, and check'd his pride.
He chose a mournful muse,
Soft pity to infuse:
He sung Lord Shelburne, great and good,
By too severe a fate,
Fallen, fallen, fallen,
Fallen from his high estate,
Where little while he stood:
Deserted at his utmost need,
By those his former bounty fed:
At Bowood, buried quick, he lies;
To dig him up no mortal tries.
With down-cast eyes the joyless Premier sate,
Revolving in his fearful soul
The various turns of chance at Court;
And now and then a sigh he stole,
And tears began to spout.
CHORUS.
Revolving &amp;c.

The mighty Watkin griev'd to see
Love was not in the next degree;
Place he sang is toil and trouble,
Eloquence an empty bubble;
Never ending, still beginning,
Boring still, and ever cloying;
If the world be worth the winning,
Think, oh think it worth enjoying!
Lovely Dundas sits beside thee,
Take the bride the K&mdash;g provides thee.
The Liv'ry rend the Hall with loud applause;
The Scot was crown'd, but Watkin won the cause.
Young Pitt, unable to conceal his pain
Gaz'd on the Scot,
And bless'd his lot,
And look'd and drank, and smiled and drank,
And eat and drank, and drank again.
At length, with love, wine, pride, and flatt'ry drunk;
The boy quite sick, beneath the table sunk.
CHORUS.
Young Pitt, &amp;c.

Now strike, Sir Watkin, crack your strings asunder,
And rouse him, like a rattling peal of thunder;
Hark, hark, the well-known sound,
That voice how it rang,
In his ears what a twang,
For help, in a fright, he stares round.
Revenge, revenge, hear Charles Fox cries,
See the whigs how they rise,
See the whips that they bear,
How they rave, hiss, and stare,
And the furies that flash from their eyes.
Behold a faithful band,
Each a rod in his hand!
They're Ministers Ghosts, that by Temple were slain,
And unbury'd remain,
Sure to rise up again.
Give the justice due
To the injur'd crew.
Behold, how they carry each vote in the House!
How they point to the Treasury Seat!
With what firm addresses their Sov'reign they meet!
Sir Watkin ceas'd &mdash; the mob made haste, with joy
To draw the coach, and windows to destroy;
But, alas!  on the way,
There happen'd a fray,
Where they all ran away,
Not a mortal would stay,
To rescue the coach, or deliver the boy.&mdash;
