Beside the pleasant Mill of Trompington
I laughed with Chaucer; in the hawthorn shade
Heard him, while birds were warbling, tell his tales
Of amorous passion.  And that gentle Bard,
Chosen by the Muses for their Page of State&mdash;
Sweet Spenser, moving through his clouded heaven
With the moon's beauty and the moon's soft pace,
I called him Brother, Englishman, and Friend!
Yea, our blind Poet, who in his later day,
Stood almost single; uttering odious truth&mdash;
Darkness before, and danger's voice behind,
Soul awful &mdash; if the earth hath ever lodged
An awful soul &mdash; I seemed to see him here
Familiarly, and in his scholar's dress
Bounding before me, yet a stripling youth&mdash;
A boy, no better, with his rosy cheeks
Angelical, keen eye, courageous look,
And conscious step of purity and pride.

[Book III, 1805; Maxwell (1971) 116]

And Shepherds were the men that pleased me first;
Not such as, 'mid Arcadian fastnesses
Seqestered, handed down among themselves,
So ancient poets sing, the golden age;
Nor such, a second race, allied to these,
As Shakespeare in the wood of Arden placed
Where Phoebe sighed for the false Ganymede,
Or there where Florizel and Perdita
Together danced, Queen of the feast, and King;
Nor such as Spenser fabled. . . .
