Ellen!  there was a time when I could tune
My harp to mirthful measures, and repeat
My songs of love with confidence, for soon
Your lip in singing them could make them sweet;
The voice of others might my accents greet
With praise or with contempt; I gladly flew
From their reproach, a recompense to meet
In Ellen's smiles of kindness, for I drew
The subject of my song, and its reward, from you.

But now my harp is tuned to notes of woe;
In losing you it lost its lively tone;
For those who now the voice of praise bestow
Can never praise or look &mdash; as you have done.
Their words may be the same, &mdash; but there are none
Who breathe them with an accent half so dear;
They may look kindly too; &mdash; but you alone
Can glance forth kindest looks that banish fear
From lovely laughing eyes, that could not be severe.

In fancy's vision I behold thee now,
In form and feature beautiful and bright;
With locks of darkest brown upon thy brow,
And eyes that beam with most expressive light;
Thy charms shall be remembered when the sight
Has ceased to trace them:  as the blaze of day
Lives unforgotten in the gloom of night:&mdash;
The hope that sweetens love has passed away,
But hopeless it exists, and never can decay.

How dull and cheerless is the garden walk!
How uninviting is the ball-room's blaze!
The gay laburnum withers on its stalk,
The monthly rosebud unobserved decays,
For Ellen cannot wear them; still I gaze
Upon the spot that you inhabited,
And trace the happiness of former days:&mdash;
Sad is the memory of pleasure fled,
Like thinking of those friends who loved us, and are dead.

Yet in the hour of mirth, I herd with those
Who kneel at fashion's altar; and I dress
In seeming apathy my inward woes,
And wear the fickle smile of cheerfulness;
Yet think not, Ellen, that I love thee less;
Or that my heart forgets thee; It is true
Those who surround me know not my distress,
But I have still thy absent form in view;
&mdash;If this is to forget thee, I have been untrue.
