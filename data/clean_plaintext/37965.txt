Here lie in peace, life's changeful voyage o'er,
The tired wanderers of the faithless main;
They find a shelter on that peaceful shore,
Where rest the weary from their toil and pain.

With courage fired, at honour's great command,
They left the bowers of indolence and ease,
Forsook the pleasures of their native land,
And ploughed with dauntless heart the foaming seas.

Britannia's thunder, dreadful to the foe,
Unwearied o'er the pathless deep they bore,
Full oft they aim'd the well-directed blow,
Full oft they bade the murdering cannon roar.

Amid the scenes of danger and of death,
Where hostile squadrons met in dread array,
Dauntless they stood, prepar'd to yield their breath,
Or follow still, where danger led the way.

The fierce extremes every clime they bore,
The burning rage of equinoctial skies,
Or where the polar billows ceaseless roar,
Where horrid mountains piled of ice arise.

When rising tempests vex'd the briny tide,
And shook old ocean with tremendous sound,
Well were they skill'd the shatter'd bark to guide,
Where hidden dangers compass'd them around.

Far from the comforts of their native soil,
Amid the scenes of elemental strife,
Still pain and penury and ceaseless toil
Mark'd the unvaried tenor of their life.

But now the fury of the savage blast
No more shall rouse them from their bed of clay;
Their weary wanderings and their toils are past,
And all the storms of life are blown away.
