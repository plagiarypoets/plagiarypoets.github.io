Should some lone trav'ller, that delights in song,
Ask on what spot my lays I did recite,
From those who live these gloomy woods among,
Where neither hill nor dale rejoice the sight;

Haply the Genius of the place may say&mdash;
"'Twas here he sought in poesy relief,
And oft in mournful mood sigh'd out the day,
Or touch'd the lyre to simplest sounds of grief.

"But yet his pipe of rudest minstrelsy,
No heart to tender sympathy could move,
For here no breast e'er felt the extasy
Which those partake who Phoebus' favours prove.

"Along the road, near yon deserted grove,
Where scarce a footstep e'er imprints the green,
Musing, at early dawn, he lov'd to rove,
And ponder o'er the solitary scene.

"One morn I miss'd him in his custom'd walk,
His lyre, neglected, lay beneath a tree;
No more in secret did I hear him talk,
Nor at the grove, nor on the road was he.

"May each sweet Muse collect her scatter'd flow'rs,
To weave a vernal garland for his head,
With nightly visitations cheer his hours,
And smooth the rugged path he's doom'd to tread."
