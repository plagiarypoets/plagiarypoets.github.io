Far, far had they fled the flying &mdash; route on route,
Like sheep without their shepherds, when pursued
By greedy wolves.  The moon, full-orb'd, look'd out,
Pale from her fleecy veil, and tinged the wood
of every mountain which refulgent glow'd
With silvery ray, all silent, and no more
Echoed the shoutings of those hounds of blood,
Cloy'd with red slaughter &mdash; the pursuit was o'er&mdash;
As glutted war retired, besmear'd with horrid gore!
