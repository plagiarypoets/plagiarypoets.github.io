Man's life's a bubble, born of empty bliss,
Flung on the ocean of unebbing time,
To drink the hues of every sunbeam kiss,
To take the dies of every varying clime,
Expanding, 'mid the growth of every crime!
Creation's veriest fiction, without name,
End, aim &mdash; a hollow toy; from out the slime
Of ever-wrought existence forth it came,
Expanded, burst, and left no trace where it had lain.
