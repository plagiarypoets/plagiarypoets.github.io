If love's bright beams e'er found a resting place,
'Twas in that softly, tender, feeling breast,
Whose sweet affection fondly loves to trace
The woes which oft our feeble frame infest;
And with the balm of kindness sooth to rest
The anguish of devouring, rending pain;
With cheerful smiles the wo-worn soul invest
With joy, like sunbeams shining in the rain,
Till heavenly light undim'd spreads o'er the lovely plain.

Yes, if there be, cloth'd in a mortal form,
Celestial virtue from heaven's starry sphere,
'Tis in that soul, with tearful pity warm,
With kind relief that dries affliction's tear:
Thou, then, to me for ever shalt be dear,
Who didst, when thrilling pain my strength unstrung,
Before me with thy tender hand appear,
And like the blooming tendril, frail and young,
And helpless and alone, my arms around thee clung.

When thou hadst borne me to that kind retreat,
Where two fond brothers dwell, with brows of light,
And piety divine had fix'd its seat;
Soft, heavenly beings met my raptur'd sight,
With smiles of seraphs beaming sweetly bright;
Gay as the op'ning morning's smiling bloom,
And whisp'ring like soft zephyrs of the night,
Which breathe from fairest flowers of rich perfume,
While Cynthia's radiant rays the fragrant path illume.
