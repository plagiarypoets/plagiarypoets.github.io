Goe famous thou, with ever flying fame,
That mak'st thy flight on Vertues wings to sore,
In worlds of hearts goe labyrinth thy name,
That wonders selfe may wondrous thee adore.
Though th' authours selfe triumph in heavenly glore,
Thou sacred worke giv'st mortall life againe;
And so thy worth hath made her evermore
In heaven and earth for ever to remaine.
Her pondrous speech, hir passion and hir paine,
Her pleasing stile shall be admir'd ilke where.
The fruitfull flowing of hir loftie braine
Doth now bewray a mothers matchlesse care,
While she lives crown'd amongst the high divines,
Thou on hir sonne celestiall sunne downe shines.
