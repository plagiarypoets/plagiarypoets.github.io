Still as the source of heat and light
With golden beams describes the year,
The daemon Slav'ry takes her flight,
And Freedom wide dilates her sphere.
She to her faithful herald cries,
Proclaim to earth, to sea, to skies,
That thro' this peopled earthly ball,
Dear Liberty's the right of all;
And that the Heaven-seal'd charter Nature gave,
Was, MAN TO MAN SHALL NE'ER BECOME A SLAVE!

The fetter'd Nations of the East,
To Britain long have turn'd their eyes,
Seen Independence on her crest,
And, like her, nobly strove to rise.
But to their slavish centre doom'd
By the dense chains of pow'r assum'd,
In vain the Patriot, void of dread,
Pierc'd by tyrannic steel, has bled,
And none to Freedom's glowing altar came,
Till France, high-favour'd, caught the British flame.

So plainly, on the tablet vast
Of Nature, are our Rights engrav'd,
'Tis wond'rous how, in ages past,
Man's hapless race should be enslav'd!
The monster, in a Monarch's form,
Can neither raise nor hush the storm;
And, whilst he desolates a land,
Marks ev'ry eye &mdash; fears ev'ry hand.
Reigns he by right divine, say ye that can,
Whom guilt and terror sink beneath a man?

Auspicious long-remembered day!
Thou gav'st us Liberty and Law;
Come, tuneful Muses!  join the lay,
To hail the advent of NASSAU.
The daughters of Olympian Jove
Shall Freedom's firmest guardians prove;
Then, aided by this potent choir,
Swell loud the chorus &mdash; strike the lyre.
The strain which fills a despot's soul with awe,
Shall hail great BRUNSWICK, circumscrib'd by Law.
