Her large dark eyes, with streaming tears suffused,
On Idwal's timidly the lady turn'd,
As if to hear and to believe unused,
As if what man could say she should have spurn'd,
A glance it was that chill'd as well as burn'd;
Beneath whose ray would hope and passion quail;
Yet beautiful:  a glance that would have learn'd
His inmost heart, and taught him to bewail
What baser thought within that heart could e'er prevail.

He looks awhile:  'tis beauty's, virtue's power,
And eloquence without the voice's aid.
He pointed eastward to a lonely tower,
That crown'd the summit of a woody glade.
"Yonder is Idwal's poor domain," he said,
"And there his cherish'd guest may be bestow'd:
The heathery fells, the little dingle's shade,
Above the rocks where late the billows flow'd,
Shall yield the shipwreck'd maid a more secure abode."
