Child of Despair!  I see thy burning eye,
Where livid lightnings in rude horror flash;
While midnight tempests rend the mental sky,
Thy reeking spears in savage triumph clash.
Offspring of Hell!  sprung from th' eternal shades;
Envenom'd fount!  whence unheard suff'rings flow:
Why keep the poison'd bowls, and ruthless blades,
To arm the victims of consuming woe?
Away, stern Monster, to the Stygian deep!
Cease on the sons of Misery to prey;
Nor let the charm of everlasting sleep
Dispel the horrors of a future day&mdash;
When the last trump shall vibrate thro' the skies,
And the long mouldering frame to life eternal rise!
