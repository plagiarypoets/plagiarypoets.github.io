Poets are scarce when Goddesses themselves
Are forst to leave their high and stately seates
Placed on the top of high Olympus Mount,
To seeke them out, to pen their Champions praise.
The time hath bene when Homers sugred Muse,
Did make each Eccho to repeate his verse,
That every coward that durst crack a speare,
And Tilt and Turney for his Ladies sake,
Was painted out in colours of such price
As might become the proudest Potentate.
But now a dayes so yrksome Idels flights,
And cursed charmes have witch'd each students mind,
That death it is to any of them all,
If that their hands to penning you do call:
Oh Virgil, Virgil, wert thou now alive,
Whose painfull pen in stout Augustus dayes,
Did daigne to let the base and silly flea
To scape away without thy praise of her.
I do not doubt but long or ere this time,
Alphonsus fame unto the heavens should clime:
Alphonsus fame that man of Jove his seed,
Sprung from the loines of the immortall Gods,
Whose fire although he habit on the earth,
May claime a pottion in the fierie Pole,
As well as any one what ere he be,
But setting by Alphonsies power divine,
What man alive or now amongst the ghoasts
Could countervaile his courage and his strength:
But thou art dead, yea Virgil thou art gon:
And all his acts drownd in oblivion.
And all his acts drownd in oblivion?
No Venus no, though Poets prove unkind,
And loth to stand in penning of his deeds,
Yet rather then they shall be cleane forgot,
I which was wont to follow Cupids games
Will put in ure Minervaes sacred Art,
And this my hand which used for to pen
The praise of love, and Cupids peerles power,
Will now begin to treat of bloudie Mars,
Of doughtie deeds and valiant victories.
