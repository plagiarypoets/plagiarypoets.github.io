Maiden of the downcast eye,
Who, when ev'ning draweth nigh,
Windest oft thy lonely way
'Neath the sober twilight grey,
Pursuing still the lonely road
By human footsteps seldom trod:
By the hills or shady woods,
Dreary cells and haunted floods;
By the church-yard's lonely bound,
Wand'ring o'er the cheerless ground&mdash;
Where oft as vulgar stories tell
From isles the midnight spectres yell;
Or where some stalwart ruins nod,
Or wealth and grandeur once th' abode,
Delighted with the dismal howl
Of ravens, and the hooting owl.&mdash;
Come, Melancholy, sober maid!
In all thy winning charms array'd,
Come sweet maid, nor once disdain
To take me in thy pensive train.
