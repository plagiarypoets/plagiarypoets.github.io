I.
While, lost to all his former Mirth,
Britannia's Genius bends to Earth,
And mourns the fatal Day;
While, stained with Blood, he strives to tear
Unseemly from his Sea-green Hair
The Wreaths of chearful May;

II.
The Thoughts which musing Pity pays,
And fond Remembrance loves to raise,
Your faithful Hours attend;
Still Fancy, to herself unkind,
Awakes to Grief the soften'd Mind,
And points the bleeding Friend.

III.
By rapid Scheldt's descending Wave,
His Country's Vows shall bless the Grave,
Where'er the Youth is laid:
That sacred Spot the Village Hind
With every sweetest Turf shall bind,
And Peace protect the Shade.

IV.
Ev'n now, regardful of thy Doom,
Applauding Honour haunts his Tomb,
With shadowy Trophies crown'd:
Whilst Freedom's Form beside her roves
Majestic thro' the twilight Groves,
And calls her Heroes round.

V.
The warlike Dead of ev'ry Age,
Who fill the fair recording Page,
Shall leave their sainted Rest:
And half-reclining on his Spear,
Each wond'ring Chief by turns appear
To hail the blooming Guest.

VI.
Old Edward's sons, unknown to yield,
Shall croud from Cressy's laurell'd Field,
And gaze with fix'd Delight:
Again for Britain's Wrongs they feel,
Again they snatch the gleamy Steel,
And wish th' avenging Fight.

VII.
If, weak to sooth so soft a Heart,
These pictur'd Glories nought impart
To dry thy constant Tear;
If yet in Sorrow's distant Eye,
Expos'd and pale thou seest him lie,
Wild War insulting near:

VIII.
Where'er from Time Thou court'st Relief,
The Muse shall still with social Grief
Her gentlest Promise keep:
Even humble H&mdash;'s cottag'd Vale
Shall learn the sad repeated Tale,
And bid her Shepherds weep.
