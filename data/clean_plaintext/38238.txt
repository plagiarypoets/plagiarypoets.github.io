O thou!  for whom wise Socrates did die,
And Plato seek by Reason's feeble aid,
Descend, dear Angel!  from the shining sky,
In Revelation's glorious light array'd;
With thy propitious smiles disperse the night,
That, like chaotic gloom, o'erwhelms my mental sight.

Lo!  beauteous Virtue!  Vice, in fair disguise,
Leads thousands, o'er her flow'ry paths, astray.
Remove, remove, from their deluded eyes,
The film of Sin, and shew thy heav'nly day;
Then Pleasure's seeming charms shall please no more&mdash;
Inform'd by thee, the soul shall Nature's GOD adore.

Depriv'd of thee, the bloom of Beauty fades,
And haggard Vice despoils each living grace;
A settled gloom the lovely face o'ershades&mdash;
Disease and Guilt the fairest hues deface:
'Tis thou alone can'st real worth bestow
On Woman's beauties here, and shield her breast from woe.

The Man who lives with passions unrestrain'd,
Finds Disappointment mar his promis'd joy;
With Sensuality his bosom stain'd,
Feels fierce Remorse his sober hours annoy.
Ah!  wretched being!  break vile Folly's chain&mdash;
In Virtue's peaceful path, lost happiness regain.

Society, fair Virtue!  bless'd with thee,
Improves its knowledge, and each useful art;
The mind expands with native energy,
Where thy creative smiles new light impart:
Thy boundless pow'r invigorates the whole,
Of social happiness, the animating soul.

O!  come, and o'er mankind thy reign extend,
To Rectitude and Peace the nations guide;
With useful knowledge ev'ry land befriend,
And save the human race from sinful pride&mdash;
Pride, thy worst foe, where thou presidest, dies,
And meek Humility guides to eternal joys.
