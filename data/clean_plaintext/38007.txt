I.
'Twas at the royal Feast for won Degrees
By Alma Mater's darling Sons of Ease;
Aloft in Elbow Chair
Their President they rear
Omnipotently great:
The mirthful Crew were plac'd around;
Each easy Face with careless Pleasures crown'd.
Thus recent Bachelors are found:
Bacchus, Dominion's second Wand
(Bacchus and all went Hand in Hand)
Receiv'd; and downwards took his Stand.
Happy, happy, free from care!
None but the Gay,
None but the Gay,
None but the Gay such Pleasures dare.

II.
Brisk Waiters all around
Removing quick the Crumbs,
With Heels mercurial skim the Ground:
The Custards fly; the Bottle comes,
And heav'nly Joy inspires.
The Feast began from Love,
Who leaving blissful Seats above,
Taught Man immortal Joys to prove:
No fiery Form the Goddess bore;
No grim unnatural Visor wore:
She made great Jove Olympia's Guest,
And soon he sought her snowy Breast;
Then round her slender Waist he curl'd,
There stamp'd an Image of himself, a Sov'reign of the World.
Each ample Goblet with a Rose is crown'd:
Sweet Heav'n-born Venus loud, they shout around,
Sweet Heav'n-born Venus loud the Roofs rebound.
With raptur'd Eyes,
Great Praeses spies
Each finish'd Glass,
Each Bottle pass,
New gen'rous Caskets rise.

III.
The Praise of much-fam'd Punch great Bacchus sung;
Of Punch all-pow'rful, stout, and strong:
The foaming Bowl in Triumph comes;
Sound the Trumpets, beat the Drums;
Elate in silver Pride,
High rolls his threat'ning Tide;
Give each encount'rer Breath; he comes, he comes!
Vacuna, lov'd of all Mankind,
Drinking Joys did first ordain;
Freedom's Blessings are a Treasure,
Drinking is the Graduates Pleasure,
Rich the Treasure,
Sweet the Pleasure,
Sweet is Pleasure after Pain.

IV.
Big with their present State the Crew grows vain;
Burn their dry studied Parchments o'er again,
And thrice 'gainst Rules and Systems roar amain.
The Father saw the Madness rise,
Their glowing Cheeks, their ardent Eyes;
And whilst they Heav'n and Earth defy'd,
Shew'd his Scroll, and check'd their Pride.
High by the President he sate
Big with the List of Fate:
He sung a Braggart vainly proud,
By too severe a Fate,
Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,
Fallen from his high Estate,
And humbled in the Crowd;
Deserted at his utmost Need,
All his boasted Knowledge fled:
Now in the second Tripos laid,
No Pow'r could raise his burthen'd Head.
With downcast Looks the silenc'd Vaunter sate,
Revolving in his alter'd Soul
The Schemes on which he had been fed;
And now a Curse in secret stole,
And shook his empty Head.

V.
The feeling Fathers griev'd to see
Bad Luck brought on the next Degree,
He will'd the killing Sound to check,
And Pity mov'd him thus to speak:
Gently dull in lengthen'd Numbers,
Thus he sooth'd his Soul in Slumbers.
Vainly dull are sophish Troubles;
Honours are but empty Bubbles;
Ceasing, soon as they're beginning,
Study's all our Ease destroying:
Happier Days thou hast been winning,
Think, then think them worth enjoying.
The mighty Bottle stands beside thee,
Take the good the Gods provide thee.
The many rend the Skies with loud Applause;
But Bacchus cou'd alone dissolve the Cause.
The Youth disdaining to reveal his Pain,
Plied hard the Bowl
That eased his Soul,
And fill'd and drank, fill'd and drank,
Fill'd and drank, and fill'd again;
At length in Seas of mighty Liquours drown'd,
He droop'd his o'ercharg'd Head, and kiss'd the Ground.

VI.
Produce the fatal Scroll again:
But now produce a happier Strain.
Salute the Youth who sits beside him,
A Wrangler's wreath the Gods provide him.
Hark, hark, the envy'd Sound
Has raised up his Head
Who so lately was dead,
And amazed he stares around.
Revenge, Revenge, he trembling cries,
See the shatter'd Glass flies;
Hear his blasphemous Prayers;
Hear his Threats &mdash; his Despairs;
See the Sparkles that flash from his eyes!
Behold he rends his Band,
Takes a Glass in his Hand.
This is his Ghost, whom the Proctors had slain,
And whose Groats still remain
In Clutches profane.
Now ye valiant Bands,
Seize him &mdash; hold back his Hands!
Behold how he tosses the Bottles on high,
How he aims at whom Fortune had fed,
And laurel'd Temples of the Wrangler's Head.
The Bowl's ample Form he vain strives to wield;
Stout Bacchus opposes his dazzling Shield;
The Way great Praeses led,
To light him to his Bed,
Whilst six fam'd Champions bear him off the Field.
