Beholding here below his scatter'd rays,
My soul a spark emitted from his fire,
Would fain attempt creation's Sun to praise,
Song far transcending loftiest Angels lyre!
And right it is toward him I should aspire,
Wise Architect!  who form'd my sight and tongue!
Children will lisp their fondness for a sire,
E'en by the birds to him are carols sung.
This theme shall flourish ever fair and young,
Unfading glories bloom in Paradise;
Ye mortal Poets, let your harps be strung
To deathless strains, to chant your Maker wise;
Awful in thunder, beauteous in each flow'r,
The world's great harmonist, and source of pow'r.
