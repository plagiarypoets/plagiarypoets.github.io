Flowrets &mdash; wreaths &mdash; thy banks along&mdash;
Silent eve &mdash; th' accustom'd song&mdash;
Silver slipper'd &mdash; whilom &mdash; lore&mdash;
Druid &mdash; Paynim &mdash; mountain hoar&mdash;
Dulcet &mdash; eremite &mdash; what time&mdash;
("Excuse me &mdash; here I want a rhime.")
Black-brow'd night &mdash; Hark!  scretch-owls sing!
Ebon car &mdash; and raven wing&mdash;
Charnel houses &mdash; lonely dells&mdash;
Glimmering tapers &mdash; dismal cells&mdash;
Hallow'd haunts &mdash; and horrid piles&mdash;
Roseate hues &mdash; and ghastly smiles&mdash;
Solemn fanes &mdash; and cypress bowers&mdash;
Thunder-storms &mdash; and tumbling towers&mdash;

Let these be well together blended&mdash;
Dodsley's your man &mdash; the poem's ended.
