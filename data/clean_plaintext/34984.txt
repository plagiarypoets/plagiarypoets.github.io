 "Shake hands."  This has been a symbol of love and friendship from the earliest ages. Thus, a deserted maiden, in Ovid's epistles, exclaims,

Heus ubi pacta fides commissaque dextera dextra.

And thus Aeneas receives his companions.

Amicum
Ilionea petit dextra laevaque Segestum.

Achilles, as a mark of friendship, takes the Greek, envoys by the right hand.

"Dispreze."  This word, differently accented, was in use in Queen Elizabeth's time,

it was
A handsome pretty-custom'd brandy-shop
As any was in Venice, none "dispraized."  Volpone, A. 5.

i.e. No offence intended to the others by an implied degradation.  The amiable trait of character in the "no dispreze" is but faintly imitated in the translation.  It denotes, that at the same time in which she would be understood as holding the least approach towards indelicacy in abhorrence, which causes her warmth of expression, she would be extremely sorry if it was understood to proceed from any personal dislike to the swains of Paracomb or Chattacomb.  She detracts not from their merits, nor wishes to degrade their characters by elevating her own.  Her real aversion to improper liberties is again strongly marked in her following speech, as well as her secret attachment to Andrew, which makes her so soon forget her cause for resentment against him.  A striking proof of our bard's intimate acquaintance with the human heart.  And it is observable, that the endearments of Andrew are less and less strenuously resisted as the drama proceeds.

"The vary vengeance."  A passage similar to this, and, the conclusion of Margery's former speech, occurs in the opening of the xx. Idyllim:  [Greek characters].  Chaucer says, when woman

&mdash;hath caught an ire
"Vary vengeance" is all her desire. &mdash; The Sompnour's Tale.

"Creem'd ma earms."  i.e. Squeezed, from the Teutonic "Krimpen," to contract, to be "creem'd with the cold," is synonimous to be cramped "prae frigore obtorpescere."  May we derive from the same word the army "crimps," who render torpid those they lay hands upon?

"How dost try."  i.e. How d'ye do?  A sea phrase, perhaps communicated to the old Exmooreans by some navigators of the Bristol Channel.  It is used by Shakspeare in the Tempest (Act i. scene i.) in a nautical sense.

"Nort marchantable" seems a figurative expression derived from commerce, "a commodity not perfectly sound or vendible."  Andrew's meaning therfore is &mdash; "Not perfectly sound or well, ever since I interchanged some blows with Roger Vrogwell."

"Scored a tack."  From the Islandic "tak" a blow, or the Latin "tactus."  "Score" is often used in the same sense as to "reckon."

"Mun."  Perhaps for "ummun," i.e. woman.

"Mumchance."  Perhaps from "mome," a foolish creature, and "chance," or come by chance, a changeling, dropt by the fairies instead of some more promising child taken away by them from the cradle.  "Mome" or "mawm" may be derived from "momar," an old Sicilian word, which denotes an idiot.

"A gurt meazel."  A hog or sow, from the cutaneous distemper to which these animals are liable; or, it may be from the Danish "meolk," and Anglo-Saxon "meole,"  milk," their general food.

Against, those meazles which we disdain should fetter us. &mdash; Coriolanus.

Oliver, in the London Prodigal, who, from his speaking so nearly the genuine language of the Moor, shews its having prevailed much more extensively in former days, threatens to take away his mistress from "theck a measel," i.e., such a worthless despicable fellow.  He often uses the word in that sense.

"Toze," I take to be of the same meaning as another Devonian word, "towzee" to "toss or tumble."

"Tamb'd en."  From an obsolete Greek word [Greek characters] to "lick," still used in the same sense at Eaton and other learned seminaries.  Some literati derive it from the sound of a blow heartily laid on, as well as "slam," or the more expressive "slam-bang," all Exmoorean words; some from the Icelandic "lem" to kill, from whence, the proverbial expression, "to give any one a 'lam-pye,'" is ingeniously traced.

"Lace" denotes to "lash," verberare toris, for which consult Junius on lace and leash; and Skinner on lace and lash.

"True ben."  Or perhaps bent, possibly to the utmost stretch of the bow.  Thus, in Hamlet, They fool me to the top of my bent."

"Thoa."  Then.

"Wut."  Wilt.

"Geed."  Gave.

"Whisterpoop."  A close offensive whisper, as disagreeable to the ear as crepitus ventris to the nose, thence applied to a sudden unwelcome blow.

"Voreway."  Immediately; so "vore-reert" denotes forthright, headlong, without consideration.

"Vutch in the Leer," to push any one (under the ribs), as if you were underpropping, from the Anglo-Saxon.  Leery denotes, among the Exmooreans, "hollow or empty."  A "leery horse," a "leery stomach," i.e. a lean horse, an empty stomach.  "Under the leer" is under the hollow of the ribs, from the A. S.

"Kep," a cap.  A. S. or Graece [Greek characters].

This combat will lose nothing on being compared with that between Amycus and Pollux (Idyll. xxii.), which the author appears to have had in his eye.  It seems in the original to have been written in a kind of irregular lyric measure, and in acting was probably accompanied with music, which gave time to the comedian (as well as regulated it) for explaining his varied feats of prowess by gesticulation.  "Es tozed en, es lamb'd en, es laced en," &amp;c. were doubtless plaid with rapidity, and, if accompanied by the marrow-bones and cleavers, musical instruments of great antiquity and popularity, though now much in disuse, must have had a happy effect.  The precise meaning of "whisterpoop," though a word in common use, I am unacquainted with, but believe that it denotes, like "lirripoop," a blow in general.  The latter word likewise is common in the north of Devon, and was formerly so probably in other parts of England. &mdash; "So, so, I've my lerrepoop already."  ("Wit at several weapons." Fletcher's Works, Oct. vol. viii. 259.)  So Oliver, in the "London Prodigal," "Such a lirripoop, as thick ich was ne'er a sarved."

"Bet cham aghest."  The Greek [Greek characters] has the same meaning, [Greek characters]. Hom. ab [Greek characters].  "Aghast" frequently occurs in old writers, and sometimes in modern, but no longer in conversation.  So Hodge, in "Gammer Gurton's Needle," A. i. S. 3. "Cham aghast, by the masse!"

"Meended to go to la."  Andrew's affirming that he could spend 40 or 50 shillings in a law-suit as well as his adversary, is one of the circumstances on which I ground the idea that this work was composed in the early part of Henry 7th's reign.  Upon a strict inquiry, and an accurate examination of several attornies bills at that time, I find a smart contest of this kind might be carried on and concluded for that sum at the Exeter Assizes.  Some people have imagined (idly enough), that those Pastorals, like the poems of Ossian and of Rowley, were composed by their editor; but the Moor-men, at the period he published them, about sixty years since, perfectly well knew by experience that an action for assault and battery would soon swallow up treble that sum.  He would not therefore, had he meant to depicture the times as they then were, have been guilty of such an inaccuracy.  That he indeed has, in a few instances, modernised the original is evident, and perhaps in this very place has substituted 40 or 50 shillings for 3 or 4 "merkes," to render the passage more intelligible to the Moor-men of his time.  By the ideal coin merks, as by pounds at present, sums were reckoned in Henry 7th's time.  In Rowley's poems they are frequently mentioned, and spelt sometimes "merkes," sometimes "mancas."  The latter probably was the court, the former the country pronunciation, As his ingenious editor has not elucidated this difficulty, the conjecture, though rather hazardous, being supported by no authority, is, I hope, entitled to pardon.

"A grabbling."  A corruption of grapple, from the Belg. "grabbalen."

"Tetties."  From the A. S.  G. [Greek characters].

"Moulad and soulad."  Or, "moulad" and "soulad," "pulled or halled about."  Shakspeare uses the latter word, though differently spelt, in the same sense.  "He'll go," he says, "and 'sole' the porter of Rome by the ears." &mdash; Coriolanus.

"Ge o'er."  From the action here referred to in the dialogue, we may suspect that these scenes were publicly exhibited to relieve, as noticed in the preface, the melancholy impression of more serious performances.  Our forefathers, in some respects not so delicate as their descendants, smiled doubtless at the freedoms of Andrew, and triumphed over the alarmed delicacy of Margery.  Long after this performance was composed, in 1600, the Mysterie, entitled Adam and Eve, was exhibited, in which they appeared in their primitive state, and, as 'tis said, "neither they nor the audience were ashamed," so that, instead of censuring our bard for approaching so near to indecency, we should applaud him for going no nearer.  Few dramatists indeed, in the following century, sacrificed so little to, the depraved taste of the times.  If some tincture of blame still remains, let us consider that he made Theocritus his model; that those liberties are warranted by the customs of Arcadia.  I refer the learned reader to the xxvii. Idyl. where the shepherdess, in terms similar to Margery's thus upbraids her shepherd [Greek characters].  The poet of the Moor was too modest and decorous to copy the original any farther &mdash; Johnson somewhere observes, that the characters introduced in pastoral poetry are neither "in real existence nor speculative probability."  The doctor was a great man, but not infallible.  That the characters in the Exmoor Courtship are true copies of nature, no Devonshire man will deny; that they agree with those drawn by Theocritus, the father of pastoral poetry, in his Idyllia, in many striking instances, is no less certain.  That the doctor, therefore, sometimes "rationated inconsequentially" is equally indisputable.

"Lock, lock."  An expression of admiration: &mdash; "Look here &mdash; Only see!"  From 'the A. S. Locah, "to see."

"The very dowl."  "The devil" (or "Deule"), from the A. S. [...]  He said 'the Deule' would have him about women." &mdash; Hen. 5.

"Volk" and "voaken," people.

"Zure and zure and double zure," for it has sometimes that addition, is considered as a Devonshire oath. &mdash; Pol. Aedipol.

"Vump."  Lump.

"Tha crowd cried."  "Fiddle."

"Squeak, squeak."  This interruption in the Musical strain is said to be often designedly produced by the fiddler in the middle of a dance to promote a more lively intercourse between the country beaux and belles; the former being expected to salute the latter during the pause which consequently ensues.  A Moor bard of my acquaintance suspects that Horace in the following passage refers to a similar circumstance, and that by "carmina divides," we are to understand the winding the strings of the lyre so tight as to cause their breaking (division), for the same purport as is mentioned in the text; and hence the propriety of the phrase "grata faeminis."

&mdash;grataque faeminis
Imbelli cythara carmina divides. &mdash; Hor. Carm. i. Od. 15.

The epithet "imbellis" denotes a lyre liable to such accidents.  Warner, in his "Second Walk through Wales," mentions, that in the peasants' dances the men salute their partners upon the musicians playing a peculiar tune.  It tends to illustrate the custom among the Ex-moor beaux noticed above, which is perhaps merely a variation of the same ancient ceremony of Celtic origin.  It may have been at one time the proemium to the dance (another variation), and alluded to by Shakspeare in his masque in the Tempest:&mdash;

Curtsied when you have, and kist.

"Over arrant" "Very great," in which sense, conjoined to another word, it frequently occurs in various writers &mdash; "an over-mind, an over-desire, an over-weening;" &mdash; to over-eat, overrun &mdash; "errant"&mdash;"from [Greek characters] "interrogo, quero.

"Mart."  "marvel."

"Whot's thate?"  The timid delicacy of Margery, and manly affection of Andrew, cannot he sufficiently admired.  How superior &mdash; how much more natural is this love scene than any that can be found in modern novels or antiquated romances!

"Tes vull stated."  This account of setting a leasehold estate (though extremely natural and prudent), does not sound very poetical; yet I did not think myself at liberty to depart from my original &mdash; nor is that indeed destitute of classical authority.  A shepherdess in Theocritus stipulates for a jointure, and her lover promises to comply with her request.  A circumstance that is here, much more delicately, proposed by the shepherd. [Greek characters] Idyll. xxvii.

"Yallow-beets."  Guineas.

"Lant."  Land.

"Gerred-teal'd" Or "gorred-tailed," from the A. S. [...] "dirt, a dunghill."

"Zar tha ill and the barra."  "Spayed sows," and (I believe) young pigs."

"Trest no zarvants."  At the opening of the Drama we are to suppose that Andrew was just arrived from his "Lant" at Parracomb, and obliged soon to return.  His prudence in persevering in that point is admirable, as well as in making love, which partakes a good deal of the modern system; but his sentiments in regard to an illicit amour, agrees with the simplicity of the golden age in its most pure and unalloyed state.

"Bant zo mad."  I cannot forbear again recalling the reader to notice this instance of virtuous simplicity.  How delightfully innocent to suspect that illicit gallantry must proceed from some degree of insanity!  When shall we hear in these degenerate days such a sentiment in court, city, or country?

"Whot marry?"  Much to the same purpose, and with the same degree of sincerity the shepherdess in Theocritus declares, [Greek characters] Idyl. xxvii. 22.

"Crock o Zendys."  Ab A. S. [...] an earthen vessel to put butter in is styled a "pan-crock" from the A. S. Panna or Penne, a pan or deep dish.

"Tha peels."  Pillows, from the A. S. pyle, pile.

"Let's hire ye zing."  A pretty, trait of character; and discovers that the message she was engaged to carry her sister, as mentioned in her preceding speech, was fictitious, to avoid the importunities of Andrew, whose heart at this period is so deeply interested in his "godly ballet," that it escapes his observation.  It is a subject of debate among the Moor critics, whether sublimity or terror principally prevails in the analysis he gives of it.

Gurt "voul theng" &mdash; [Greek characters] &mdash; the foul thing, in former times denoted the Devil: &mdash; "shield us fro the foule thing."

"Whatycomb."  This means "the what d'ye call him, the congurer ("Haviolus"), who uses his supernatural powers to benevolent purposes;" &mdash; the "Mago Christiano" in Italian poetry.

"Ghost and gallows."  Here seems a little mistake; as the ghost appears to have been laid by the "Whit-witch," and sent to their usual place of exile, the Red Sea, which, according to the gardener's opinion in the "Drummer," and who deems to have been an honest Ex-moorean, was certainly stocked with a "power of em." However that may be, it must be allowed that the group would not have been complete with him. The concise sublimity of the original (enfeebled as I fear by the expanded version), cannot be sufficiently admired.  The terrifying aggregate of "tha parson and tha dowl, the ghost and the gallows," set all imitation at defiance. &mdash; What a noble subject for the pencil of Fuzeli!

"Tabb o' tha tongue."  A gurrulous tattling person.  By Aphaerisis for "blab," or from the Belgic "labbern," to "babble," or the Latin "labium." &mdash; In the Miller's Tale of Chaucer we have

&mdash;I am no "labbe,"
Ne, though I say it, I "n'am not lefe to gabbe."

This language of the courtly Chaucer is now only perfectly intelligible in the neighbourhood of Exmoor.

"Che'll" or "chill," I will. &mdash; "In the London Prodigal," Oliver says, "If I do not meet him, 'chill' give you leave to call me 'cut'"; &mdash; a vituperative appellation equally disliked by Sir Andrew Aguecheek&mdash;" if I don't, call me 'cut.'"

"Spicy vella and a vitty vella." "Special and clever in any kind of business;" &mdash; the latter word may he traced to the Belgic "vitten," to fit.

"Zooterly vella."  "Lubberly."

The seventh day was considered by the old Greeks as sacred to Phoebus &mdash; a Sun-day, [Greek characters].

"Meach off."  Go off secretly or clandestinely. &mdash; The boy, schoolboy, or apprentice, who absents himself without leave is called a "mitcher" universally in Devonshire.  The commonly people in Glocestershire call a notorious truant &mdash; "a blackberry moucher."

Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a "micher," and eat blackberries?  
1 Hen. IV. A. ii. S. 2.

Perhaps it may be a corruption of "march."

"Unearst."  Or "anenst &mdash; "near," from A. S.

"Ya Alkitotle."  A silly elf or oaf.  from the A. S. [...] "Alce," an elk, and [...] to totter; that animal being frequently attacked by the falling-sickness, and not able in consequence to support himself.  Hence applied to men in a similar state who have the appearance of idiocy, and to idiots themselves.  If this conjecture be allowed, we must suppose the word originally used in the forests of Germany, where this animal once abounded, and from whose inhabitants the Exmooreans descended. &mdash; "To tottle" is extensively applied in Devon to silly people, particularly to the old who "tattle" and "totter."

"Voolish trapes."  To "trapes" or "trapse" up and down, meant to saunter in an idle lazy manner. Hence, the noun "trapes," from the Teut. "traben," to walk about. A drab proceeds in the same manner from the Belgic "drabben."

"Zo zurt."  Soft.

"Nif's."  And if.

"Vall over the Desk."  "To have the banns of matrimony thrice called," which being done, it was usual for the minister in some places to throw the paper over his desk into the clerk's pew, who sat under him; as signifying, according to the phrase, that they were called out, and the parties had nothing to do now but to be married.

"Wont thir ma."  To frighten, perhaps from the Latin "terrere," or A. S. [...] or [...] "a hurt," "to hurt."  We have unluckily no Saxon types.
