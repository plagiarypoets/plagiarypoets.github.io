My soul is dark and barren: &mdash; fancy's flowers
Have perish'd long; then let my dull strain close.
Hang there, my harp!  nor through succeeding hours
Wake thy worn strings again to count my woes.
That only source from which thy song arose
I have exhausted &mdash; far as song may tell;
And if with thine my spirit could repose
From thoughts which wring it from its inmost cell,
How should I joy to breathe one long and last FAREWELL!
