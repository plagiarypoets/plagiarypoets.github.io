The room was low and lone, but lingered there,
In careless loveliness, the marks of mind;
The page of chivalry, superb and drear,
Beside a half-filled vase of wine reclined,
Told how romance and gaiety combined.
And there, like things of immortality,
Stood Statues, in their master's soul enshrin'd,
VENUS, with the sweet smile and heavenly eye,
And the sad, solemn beauty of pale NIOBE.

And scattered round, by wall and sofa, lay
Emblems of thought, that loved from Earth to spring.
Upon a portrait fell the evening ray,
Touching with splendour many an auburn ring
That veil'd a brow of snow, and crimsoning
The bending a Spanish cheek with living rose.
And there lay a guitar, whose silvery string
Is murmuring, as the soft wind o'er it flows,
The tones it breath'd on Spanish hills at evening's close.
