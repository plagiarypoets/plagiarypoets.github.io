Waft me, oh  waft me to the shade,
By close embow'ring branches made!
Where purling brooks and trinkling rills
In soft harmonious cadence play,
And sweetly murmur all the day!

Oh!  let me there for ever dwell,
In the green grot or mossy cell!
And, free from hurry, care, and strife,
Enjoy a lonely, peaceful life;
There hermit-like, with pious care,
Find out my God, for God is there!

In thoughtful mood there let me learn
The vanity of life to mourn;
Lament the dire effects of fate,
And dreadful downfalls of the great;
See pyramids and turrets high,
In piles of mighty ruin lie;
And mark how tombs of trophy'd kinds
Time into dark oblivion flings.
Oh!  happy solitude!  in thee,
At length, my greatest good I see;
Nor would I leave thy homely cell,
For domes where scepter'd monarchs dwell,
Thou spotless pleasures can'st supply,
With thee I'll live, with thee I'll die.
