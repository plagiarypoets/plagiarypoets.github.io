Ne longer beam'd the radiant god of day,
And scarce a murmur floated in the air,
The shepherd whistling homeward bent his way
To happy scenes, devoid of every care;
To smiling boys, whose blooming features wear
The marks of ruddy health, and peace, and joy,
Who strive full oft the father's gift to share,
Some blooming nosegay, or some childish toy,
Which he had kindly purchas'd at the neighbouring fair.

'Twas then a youth, oppress'd with many a woe,
Upon whose cheek oft fell the chrystal tear,
Mov'd o'er the plain, with trembling steps and slow,
Mournful, without a pitying friend to cheer
His sadden'd soul, which like the winter drear,
Was gloomy horror all, where nought but grief,
Keen, piercing grief, was found, nor there
Did smiling Hope e'er bring her sweet relief,
And shed her cheering beams, or bring kind prospects near.

His parents died, ere yet twelve times the sun
O'er his young head had run its annual round,
And ne'er a friend he knew, not one
This orphan's mournful lot with comfort crown'd;
No soothing voice he heard, no welcome sound
Of charity once met his ear, but spurn'd
By all, in lonely solitude he found
Sweet happiness, there oft his bosom burn'd
With manly virtues, hid, like ore, beneath the ground.

A little hut he rais'd with many a clod,
His food was herbs, his drink the limpid stream;
Nature the book which rais'd his soul to God,
And taught him life itself was but a dream:
'Twill soon be past, he cry'd, while many a beam
Of joy then sparkled in his youthful eye,
'Twill soon be past, no more my sorrows seem
T' oppress my soul with grief, or raise the sigh,
Ere long the rays of happiness will on me gleam.

Thus he philosophiz'd &mdash; but now remov'd
From calm retirement's ever still retreat,
He sought the fair, whom once he saw and lov'd,
Whom once he saw and lov'd, she look'd so sweet
As she pass'd by his cot on airy feet,
And fled so swift the youth pursued in vain
Thro' many a grove, the gentle muses seat,
Or o'er the mountain, or across the plain,
He found her not, she skimm'd along with steps so fleet.

Gloomy despair at length bedimm'd his soul,
As now he sought to end his numerous woes,
His yes, once sparkling, now with horror roll,
And frantic to the precipice he goes;
There gaz'd a moment, then himself he throws
Off the high summit in the stream below,
Clos'd were his eyes in death, no longer glows
His breast with ardour, ne'er again he'd know
The cares, or joys of life; but every vein is froze.
