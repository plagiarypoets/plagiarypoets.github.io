Come, thou Goddess fair and free,
Whom the meek Nymph, Simplicity,
To the Son of Maia bore,
And nursed upon th' Athenian shore,
Then to thy Sire her Charge resign'd;
Who to such Elegance of Mind
Added, whatever polished Ease
Could give, and all the Arts to please:
Whether on Reynolds (beauty's friend)
Thou biddest every Grace attend;
Or smiling dost in sportive Song
Hail the great guest of Kien-Long:
Hither various Goddess haste,
Boundless, inimitable, Taste,
And save those Charms from Fashion's tawdry Reign
Which Nature gave to Devon, and gave in vain&mdash;
From her cumbrous Forehead tear
The Architecture of her Hair,
But leave one snow-white Plume, to shew
It faintly mocks the Neck below&mdash;
Snatch from her Lips th' immodest Guile
Of Affectation's constant Smile,
And on her Cheek replace the Rose,
Which pale and wan, no longer glows,
With all that Beauty, Youth, and Love,
Could copy from some Saint above&mdash;
Would she promise real Bliss,
Bid her seem but what she is:
Or if lovelier still she'd be,
From Granby learn to worship thee.
