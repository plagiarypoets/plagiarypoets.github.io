Wretched the bard, who from a golden dream
Or splendid guineas from Sir Robert's hand
Awakes to penury and want, and kens aside
His galligaskins hang, with pocket wide,
Horrible gaping; he shudders as he views
The frightful, vacant, vast, terrific chasm,
"Ill-fated, curst receptacle of coin,
Why wert thou made?  since thou wert made in vain;
Who views thy form, but thence thy master knows,
A modern poet, like thyself, forlorn;
A wretched caitiff, like thyself despis'd:
Why, why do dull philosophers maintain
That thro' all nature's works all things are filled?
Here, here, ye speculative drones, behold
A proof that all your theory is false?
Here is a vacuum (horrible to speak)
That's not unnatural, a sport of chance;
But almost ever empty, as 'tis now.
Ye gods, why struck ye not yon yawning gulf
Wider and wider yet; expand it far,
Dilated and opaque; sink, sink it deep,
Down to the earth's midcenter:  calm and sedate,
With smiles replete, I'd view th' immense profound:
Then like the Roman, who in antient times
Impetuous drove into the Earth's wide womb
And sought with joy a voluntary death;
Like him I'd plunge head-long with pleasure down
Into the vast abyss, and think it heaven.
Strange thought!  but that a heaven must prove to me,
Where want, where duns, where bailiffs are no more."
He said, and starting on his feet upright,
Impetuous rush'd athwart the flocken bed
Disconsolate; awhile he lay intranc'd;
Till the hard matted flocks awak'd the bard
To want, to duns, to bailiffs once again.
