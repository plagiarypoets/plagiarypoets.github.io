The trembling lyre I nicely, careful strung,
Then touch'd the chords, a tender mellow sound
Sprung up and cheer'd me; for a while it rung,
And echoed were its tunes from all around.
Back on my heart returned the thrilling sound,
A sudden, inward joy was there exprest,
And many a time it gladsome did rebound,
And as it bounded, rose and fell my breast,
Till ev'ry "carking care" seem'd slumber'd and at rest.

And why the joy?  It sung of Friendship's pow'r,
Divine and holy, as the mother's kiss,
It brought to mind the happy, long-past hour
That I had spent, and spent in perfect bliss.
But ah!  how fickle, frail a world is this!
How soon our joys disperse, like loosen'd air
From strong compression; oh!  'tis then we miss
The joys which once but only tasted were,
That now make open way for dire and dark despair.

Blest lyre!  oh!  let me touch thy chords again,
Oh!  let me bring to memory the past,
Oh!  let me ease the inward-working pain,
Nor think one moment of the dread contrast;
But light my mind, yes, e'en as summer blast
That waves and kisses ev'ry blooming flower,
Nor for a while let one dark shadow cast
Itself on me; or even near me low'r,
But let me happy be, for even one short hour.
