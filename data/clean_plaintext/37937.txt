Lives there a mortal, whose unfeeling heart
Was never warmed by love's celestial glow?
To whom his smiles no pleasure can impart,
His frowns could never teach one fear to know?
If there are beings thus exempt from woe,
I envy not a calm which nought can feel;
No!  rather let my tears for ever flow,
Than thus my breast against affection steel!
Never may chilling apathy those drops congeal.

The mother, who beside her infant weeps,
Seeing the bloom of health begin to fade,
And marks his feverish snatches as he sleeps,
By dark forbodings feels her heart dismayed;
Yet how are all her anxious hours o'erpaid,
Should he survive, recovered by her care!
True to the feeling nature ne'er betrayed,
She blesses him who gave her breast to share
The raptures of delight, the anguish of despair.

The duteous daughter doomed in youth to mourn,
When pious sorrow all her soul subdues,
From parents dear, by death relentless torn,
Vain consolations will at first refuse:
And cherishing whate'er her grief renews,
Will dwell on scenes of former tenderness;
Such soothing sorrow would she rather choose,
Than the false pleasures men call happiness,
For sense of duty done has still the power to bless.

The sailor sent 'midst trackless seas to roam,
Regrets each object heeded not before,
Sadly he muses on his absent home,
And feels each friend he loves endeared the more;
But when he views again his native shore,
What transport flows through all his swelling veins!
When he recounts his toils and dangers o'er,
And on his knee his wondering boy sustains,
He envies not their bliss, who never felt his pains.
