O Liberty, that on the plain
Where gladder flows the mighty Seine,
Thy radiant form hast rear'd;
And, leaving to the stupid slave
The chains, which Gothic darkness gave,
In simple grandeur hast appear'd!

By all, who in thy cause have bled,
Or struck thy vanquish'd foes with dread,
With shouts of triumph blest;
By that brave pair, whose godlike deed
From chains immortal Athens freed,
Their swords in myrtle garlands drest;

By him, who, fir'd with patriot zeal,
Lifting on high the vengeful steel,
Bade guilty Caesar fall;
Which fearless Virtue shall commend,
Howe'er she rue the murd'rous friend,
Impell'd by her relentless call;

By his great soul, disdaining life,
When hopeless in the sacred strife;
By Cato's willing stroke;
By Orange, curst Iberia's foe;
And injur'd Tell's indignant blow,
Which dark Oppression's sceptre broke;

By Runnimede's thrice-hallow'd plain;
By worthless Stuart's short-liv'd reign,
Who fled o'erwhelm'd with shame;
By Sidney's blood, ignobly shed,
And awful arm the tyrant's dread;
By Hampden's everlasting name;

By all the sacred ties, that bind
The freeborn children of mankind;
By all, that's great and good;
By trampled want's low-mutter'd moans,
The worn-out slave's unpitied groans,
And fields deep-drench'd with guiltless blood;

By Virtue friendless and forlorn,
Mock'd by the pointing hand of scorn,
While Guilt and Falsehood rise;
By hate of superstition's pow'r,
Before whose eyes, that abject low'r,
The gen'rous soul of manhood dies;

By ev'ry sorrow of the cell,
Where Pray'r and faded Penance dwell,
Its doubts and loose desires,
Its strong regrets, heart-aching rest,
The pale-cheek'd virgin's love-sick breast,
Far-reaching thoughts, and hopeless fires;

By the dark dungeon's lone complaint,
Where, save his moan in echos faint,
The captive hears no sound;
By the slow torture's ghastly fears,
Its shrieks, its agonizing tears,
Its writhing limbs, and groans profound;

By these, O Freedom, hear thy son,
And let those triumphs, nobly won,
Still grace thy new retreat;
And he, the sacrilegious foe,
Who 'gainst thee aims the lawless blow,
May he thy tenfold vengeance meet.

But far, O far be from thy side
Fierce Anarchy, her dagger dy'd
In blood of guiltless friends;
And dark Proscription, fiend abhorr'd,
Whose savage unrelenting sword
O'er all, but chief the good, impends.

Bid Cruelty and Horror cease,
And in thy train let smiling Peace,
And Order calm appear;
And Justice, Mercy's milder mate,
That o'er her suff'ring victim's fate,
Recoiling, sheds the pitying tear.
