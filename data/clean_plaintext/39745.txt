On thy suburban bank, fair Harrow-weald!
Although thine airy downs are now enclos'd,
And tasteless ploughshares furrow up each field,
Yet once the Laureat's verse-fill'd head repos'd:
Alas, those eyes in cloud-capp'd night are clos'd!
Now from his grave alone sweet wild-flowers spring,
(His grave of briar'd turf, and moss compos'd)
Wild-flowers he gather'd when on earth, to fling
O'er Britain's matchless Queen, o'er Britain's matchless King.

Oft, where the humble-bee, with buzzing hum,
At many-colour'd evening's careless hour,
Seem'd, by the whispering air, in act to come,
And rous'd the viewless myriads round his bower,
P&mdash;e too would buzz and hum &mdash; the song-soul'd power
Of court-born panegyric on his tongue;
His ivy-mantled brow like some grey tower
Enwreath'd with frontlet green, which off he flung,
To deck that Queen and King, whom ceaselessly he sung.

But now&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
And, if Hope's faded pleasures the bosom thus melt,
What has Memory more of such pain to be felt?
