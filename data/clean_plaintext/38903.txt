Oh, hallowed heart, and dignity of worth,&mdash;
Immortal PAGET!  thy full fame is now
Fixed firm for ever: &mdash; thy fierce wars brought forth
No blossom like to this: &mdash; thy soldier brow,
Though brave, was like the many.  But the flow
Of thy heart's best affections wins for thee
What battle's carnage ne'er could gain below,
The overflowing blessing that comes free,
And glorifies a name which mourns for misery.

All hail, unsullied One! &mdash; e'en while the stream
Of Erin's blood runs quickly, shall be dear
Thy memory to her offspring:  as a beam
Of light on darkness, has thy generous tear
Fallen on her varied woes.  'Tis to revere
And love thy name, a hapless land shall smile:
If it may be allowed thus much to wear,
Unenvied by the factions, who revile
And trample on the rights of a poor, wretched Isle.

Oh, future years of Fate! &mdash; remember Him
In the far stretch of Fame's eternity!
When war's red page shall read more faint and dim,
Let this most gentle fame the brightest be,
And let it feed on Ages.  Liberty
At length shall wake its strength, and that fair day,
When Erin shall be heard, &mdash; and ANGLESEY
Shall live in her fond records, &mdash; as a ray,
Amongst her First and Dearest, &mdash; never to decay!
