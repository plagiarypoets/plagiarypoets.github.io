Snuffers, that oft were wont, with kindly aid,
The glimmering taper's dim expiring light
To reassure; and while, in absent plight,
Thy master studious hung his lumpish head,
The toil-deriding snuff with edge abrade;
What sacrilegious hand thy rivets bright,
Thrice polish'd, quaint, and pleasant to the sight,
Hath ruthless sever'd? &mdash; Now, when Night her shade
Hath spread o'er all the desolated room,
How may I chace away the dusk ambiguous?
And yon dim taper, "counterfeiting gloom,"
Vivid restore? &mdash; Or, to some cell contiguous
For aid I manful cry; or (hapless doom!)
Curtail th' aspiring snuff with thumb irriguous.
