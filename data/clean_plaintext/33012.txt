What time the Sunne, with his day-labouring teames
Is dryving downe unto the West apace,
T' refresh his cauples in the Ocean streames,
And coole the fervor glowing in his face,
Which now appeares by his hie-coloured beames,
To rest him from our Hemisphere a space,
Leaving foule darknes to possesse the skies,
The fittest time for bloody tragedies.

With torches now attempting the sad Cave,
Which at their entrance seemeth in a fright,
At the reflection that the brightnes gave,
As till that time it never saw the light,
Where light and darknes, with the power they have,
Strongly for the preheminence doe fight,
And each confounding other, both appeare
As to their owne selves they contrary were.

The craggy cleeves which crosse them as they goe,
Make as theyr passage they would have denyde,
And threatning them their journy to forslow,
As angry with the path that was their guide,
As they their griefe, and discontent would show,
Cursing the hand that did first devide.
The combrous falls, and risings seeme to say,
This wicked action could not brooke the day.

The gloomy lamps this troope still forward led,
Forcing the shadowes follow on their backe,
Are like the mourners waiting on the dead,
And as the deede, so are they ugly blacke;
Hate goes before, confusion followed,
The sad portents of blood-shed, and of wrack,
These fain dym-burning lights as all amazed,
At those deformed shades whereon they gazed.

The clattering Armes their Maisters seeme to chide,
As they would reason wherefore they should wound,
And striking with the poynts from side to side,
As though even angry with the hollow ground
That it this vile and ruthlesse act should hide,
Whose stony roofe lock'd in their dolefull sound,
And hanging in the creekes, draw backe againe,
As willing them from murther to refraine.
