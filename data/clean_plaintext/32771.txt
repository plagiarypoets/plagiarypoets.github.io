Sidney, sweet Cignet, pride of Thamesis;
Apollos laurel; Mars-his proud prowesse:
Bodine, register of Realmes happinesse,
Which Italyes, and Fraunce's wonder is:
Hatcher, with silence whom I may not misse:
Nor Lewen, Rhetoriques richest noblesse:
Nor Wilson, whose discretion did redresse
Our English Barbarisme:  adjoyne to this
Divinest morall Spencer:  let these speake
By their sweet Letters, which do best unfould
Harveys deserved prayse:  since my Muse weake
Cannot relate somuch, as hath bene tould
By these Fornam'd:  then vaine it were to bring
New feather to his Fames swift-feathered wing.
