Bleak winter reigns, ilk hill's o'erlaid wi' snaw,
Cauld frae the north wi' bir the tempests blaw;
The rowan spait ilk neib'ring tenant drees,
While brattling hailstanes sough amang the trees:
Syne the herd lads, saeblens they canna' tent
Their cauldrise hirsles on the elricht bent,
To shun the storm their doors they carefu' steek,
And 'mang the au'd fowk round the ingle beek,
There joke, and crack, and jilt a dainty sang,
Ilk ane as happy as the night is lang.

MARION, begrutten (for her jo' nae doubt),
Spite o' the weather bides alane thereout;
She leaves her cosy beild the sharpest day,
Ayont the know 'mang birks to speak her wae,
To mourn her WILL, gane o'er the rowan flood,
To fight wi' honour for his country's good;
There recklessly she wanders aft alane,
And to the naked scroggs thus makes her mane.

"Ye dreary howms, that smil'd sae blithe shortsyne,
How like, waes me!  your dowy state to mine!
Nae gowans sprout; a's darn'd in wreaths o' snaw,
As I'm in grief since Willie gade awa'!
My winsome Will, o' a' our herds the wale,
The sweetest singer on the flow'ry dale,
Has cross'd the seas, left me behind to mourn,
Has left me, eblins never to return!
O what cou'd tempt my lad sic risks to rin!
His country to forsake, and a' his kin:
Cou'd his bien rooms, his hills clad o'er wi' sheep,
His droves o' ky, and gaits on ilke sheep,
His dainty pipe that a' our hearts cou'd raise;
Nor Marion, anes sae meikle made o', please?
He wadna' be advis'd at ony riate;
He'd be a soger, nought could wise him frae't;
'And can yon ferly why sae fair I mourn,
When Will's awa', and never may return?'

"How mair than happy were you blithesome days!
The whilk to think on still sic pleasure gi'es:
Yon days I lilted on the sunny hill,
Frae morn to e'ening dawred by my Will!
When aft he talk his love, and ca'd me his,
And sweetly toolied for the tither kiss;
Yet a' my pleasure's intermix'd wi' pain,
To think I'll never be sae blithe again&mdash;
'To think my Will whom late and ear' I mourn,
May never &mdash; never to my arms return!'

"Vocky was I ere yet he gade awa',
He look'd sae trig, and buskit was sae bra';
Upon the field he shaw'd sae meikle skill,
The lave were coofs when even'd to my Will:
But when that mourning came we were to part,
How wae was I, how heavy was my heart!
Fu' lang he held me in his loving grips,
Dighted my een, and kiss'd my glowing lips,
Syne cry'd farewel, I'se ay hae mind o' thee,
Remember Marion when ayont the sea!
And will my jewel ay o' me had mind!
Think on his Marion he has left behind?&mdash;
Thee too I'll think on, or I've tint my skill;
Nae inn shall rise when I forget my Will!
'He ha'ds my heart &mdash; for him I dowy mourn,
For fear he never frae the wars return!'

"Ye feckless lambkins, gang nae out o' view!
I'm laith to tyne you, Willy liked you:
Aft has he led you to the clover green,
Was carefu' ay to bught you in at e'en:
Youth on his brent brow smil'd, and sweet content,
While herding you he whistled on the bent.
Ablins my Willy, winsome Will, e'en now,
Wi' sabbing bosom, thinks o' me and you;
And canty sang, you feeding by our side:
But now far aff frae kindred and frae hame,
Expos'd to hardships Willie hunts for fame:
Ablins enow the nipping frost he drees,
Nae house near hand, nae comfortable bleeze!
Wou'd I were there &mdash; but dread o' skaith or harm,
Thir arms shou'd clasp &mdash; this bosom keep him warm:
'But far my Willie's frae me whom I mourn,
And ablins never &mdash; never may return!'

"Fain wad I trow that which I green for maist!
Wad fain believe I'll see him safe at last;
Think he'll return a comfort to us a',
And gar me bless the day he gade awa'!
But soon my mind misgies &mdash; the warst I dread;
What numbers die in this unnatr'ral fee'd!
And may nae he, my Will, amang the lave,
Untimely fa', and fill ae common grave?
Wi' sicklike thoughts I'm ilka night opprest,
And awfu' dreams deprive me o' my rest:
Lest owk the candle burning blue was seen,
And trenchers jingled mair than anes yestreen:
Welt'ring in blood, nae ane to mind his cries?
His comely cheeks deform'd wi' mony a scar,
Far frae his friends, frae dowy Marion far;
Nae pitying ee his wounds in tears to bathes!
Nae Christian hand to close his een in death!
Forbid it, hea'n!  ay let me hope the best:
Compose my thoughts, and calm my troubled breast:
And, a' ye pow'rs aboon!  let Willie skair
Your greatest benisons &mdash; your eident care:
O skaithless keep him in this bloody fray!
And a' my thoughts and a' my doubts forgie."

By this time night was drooping hastly down,
Nae starns appear'd, clouds darn'd fare sight the moon;
Her sheep she faulded, hameward bent her way,
And drown'd in sleep the sorrows of the day.
