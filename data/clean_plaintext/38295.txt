May I, while health and strength remains,
And blood flows warm within my veins;
Find out some virgin, soft and kind,
Who is to social joy inclin'd;
A nymph who can for me forgo,
The fop, the fribble, and the beau;
From noise and show, content can be,
To live at home with love and me:
Such pleasures Love and Hymen give,
And such a life I wish to live.
