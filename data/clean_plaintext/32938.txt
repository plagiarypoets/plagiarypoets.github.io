Colin's gone home, the glorie of his clime,
The Muses Mirrour, and the Shepheards Saint;
Spencer is ruin'd, of our latter time
The fairest ruine, Faeries foulest want:
Then his Time ruines did our ruine show,
Which by his ruine we untimely know:
Spencer therfore thy Ruines were cal'd in,
Too soone to sorrow least we should begin.
