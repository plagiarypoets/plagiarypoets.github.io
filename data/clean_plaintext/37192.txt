Cowards have bravely died &mdash; when worlds beheld,
And cheering Fame her banners wav'd in air;
Revenge and ire have nature's pleadings quell'd,
And valiant moments have releas'd despair;
Ev'n stripling Love, the dimpled and the fair,
Hath press'd the mortal lancet to his breast,&mdash;
And shiv'ring Penury willing turn'd to rest
From life's dark augury of ceaseless care&mdash;
Not bravely scorning death, &mdash; but weak, by life opprest.

Lo!  bigot Mary bids the faggot blaze,
And stedfast saints undaunted hail their doom;
For, from the pyre shoot crowns of heavenly rays,
And golden censers kindle sweet perfume.
Ye glorious visions!  hide the yawning tomb!&mdash;
The tomb is hid!  the strengthen'd martyr dies!
His soul, impregnate with immortal bloom,
Triumphant seeks her summer in the skies,
Nor heeds the scattered dust that prone in ruin lies.

And what was life in sad Cornelia's view,
When, from the deck, she saw her Pompey slain?
How did she blame the rash officious crew,
Whose keel reverted bore her o'er the main,
Never to view that mangl'd corse again!
Oh!  rather far with him she would have died,
Who, press'd by fate, by faithless friends betray'd,
Fond, tho' forlorn, had call'd her to his side&mdash;
Perish the woman's name, who fear had then obey'd!

Nor singly Arria decks th' historic page,
To speak the triumphs of courageous love,&mdash;
Nor Decius, singly, breasts the battle's rage,
To tell mankind how patriot passions move:&mdash;
Let blazing Moscow, Talavera prove,
How, mid the throes of fate the soul is strong!
As sand and pebbles swept by Ocean's tide,
Bears Passion's swell, Life's scatter'd ties along,
While o'er the surge prevails the buoyant bubble &mdash; Pride.

But oh!  when ebbing life lies lone and low,
When the clos'd chamber images the tomb,&mdash;
When all around is still, save gliding slow
The stealthy nurse with brow of boding gloom,
Or the fond friend, who vainly would assume
The smile of Hope, mock'd by the starting tear&mdash;
What boots it then to be renown'd or great!
Heroes and slaves alike are vanquish'd here!
All dread the curtain'd hour of solemn parleying fate;

Here are no laurels &mdash; here no loud acclaim
Drowning the "still small voice," the nat'ral fear,&mdash;
Vain is the promise of a deathless name,
Unreal breath!  to him whom death is near,
In act deliberate, in aspect drear;&mdash;
Where, sad Ambition!  are your wonted fires?
A common debt, a common lot prevail,&mdash;
Nor valour, nor consent stern death requires,
No terror can appease, nor flatt'ring vows avail;

He, o'er whose lofty front the war-plumes wav'd,
Nodding defiance of the grisly king&mdash;
Thro' flood and fire who various fortunes brav'd,
And counted danger a contemptuous thing,
To humbler service doth his brav'ry bring&mdash;
To war with common aches &mdash; to bow his pride
To woman's rule, to bless the dext'rous hand
Whose art may one oblivious hour provide&mdash;
Imperious now no more, &mdash; he quails to her command;

Here the vain beauty, and the modest maid,
Forget alike, their conquests and their charms
Devoted lover!  where's your proffer'd aid?
A mighty rival tears her from your arms,
Whom you, so oft, have vow'd to shield from harms,
And you, with all your love, can only weep!
With the vow'd partner of your future hours;
Say, will you now your fond engagements keep?
She dies &mdash; and you return to pleasure's rosy bow'rs!

Return unwarn'd, though you beheld her die,&mdash;
Saw the dread change, the terror and the tomb,
And for a moment deem'd 'twere sweet to lie,
Ev'n in the grave that did her charms inhume!
Nor yet, as vaguely!  to dispel the gloom
Of transient mem'ry, cease, by fits, to paint
Future re-union in some region bright,&mdash;
Some distant future &mdash; fancy's flimsy feint,
To baffle sober search, and reason's steady light!

Oh!  of all human madness, 'tis most strange
That man should still neglect his strongest need!
Lavish his soul on toys of time and change,
Yet slight, for transient pleasure's dubious meed,
The only certainty to man decreed!
Hope's cheated creditor should still pursue
To-morrow's promise, reckless of the past!
Live on brief futures, yet with death in view,
Provide for all but this &mdash; the surest and the last.

Thou Bard "unknown!"  like him of old disguis'd,
Who, among shepherds, breath'd Olympian strains,
And through veil'd Godhead, and a lot despised,
Bestow'd his lyre to humanize the plains,&mdash;
(Bard, let me call thee, tho' no verse restrains!)
Oh!  if the Passion's move at thy command,
And thoughts take life, which others feebly dream,&mdash;
Warm'd by the touch of thy Promethean wand,
Win back thy way to heav'n &mdash; be heav'n thy theme!

Well hast thou painted Superstition's woes,
Th' enthusiast's dream, the bigot's gloom severe,
All the wild various anarchy that flows
From blind-fold zeal, led on by frantic fear;
(Well know th' unlisted, truth presides not here!)
But boots it thee, so gifted &mdash; to confine
Thy skill in human phantasy, to prove
That fallen man has lost that light divine?
Can laughter heal our tears? &mdash; scorn, madd'ning doubts remove?

If so, the harshest were the wisest art,
And all that faery net-work of the brain
Imagination weaves, to win the heart,
Was given to thee, &mdash; to us who read &mdash; in vain!
Oh!  mock not idly her important reign.
Regent of Hope and Fear! &mdash; be thou her friend,
And kindly counsellor, not anarch rude,
Blazoning the erring rule he fails to mend&mdash;
Wayward, though kind, is she, and gently should be woo'd!

Where was thy scoff's illustrious pattern &mdash; where
Heaven's genuine offspring, clad in native white&mdash;
When heaven's dishonour'd altars were thy care?
Why the true Priestess banish'd from our sight?
Chissel'd by thee, chaste, fair, divinely bright,
Shedding angelic tears by Burley's side,
Had she appeared &mdash; like column more sublime
O'er ruin's darken'd mass &mdash; then had defy'd
Thy fame all rival boast, and shar'd all after time.

The richest banquet Genius ever spread,
Transcending far, Apicius' snares of sense&mdash;
Brief as convivial hours, but warms the head
To vainer dreams, if soul's immortal thence,
Draw not some nourishment of fair pretence
To sate immortal cravings &mdash; man must die!
This thought, which folly shrinks to entertain,
Haunts reason still &mdash; the hair-hung sword on high,
Scaring life's feast &mdash; or kind, parting the pris'ner's chain;

Kind, if Religion comment on the theme,
And wisdom listen to the heavenly maid!
Dread, if abandon'd to conjecture's stream,
Man float his all where helm nor star give aid!
What human thought can pierce the dismal shade
Of death's dark valley?  who assurance find
Of an hereafter, from aught imaged here&mdash;
Where change perpetual, laws unvarying bind,
And Nature still rolls on her ever circling sphere

In calm mutation?  death succeeding life&mdash;
(Brief life!  the guest that tarrieth but a day);
Yet with fresh births, fresh seasons, ever rife,
Majestic Nature shares not the decay&mdash;
What then forbids that she endure for aye?
Remorseless of her buried sons, move on
Through endless ages, leaving to their sleep,
Them on whom one day's sun so brightly shone!&mdash;
They who lov'd life so well, and could for others weep?

Oh!  the sad thought &mdash; to slumber in the dust---
Hope quench'd, ambition cold, joy, friendship, love,
The faithful heart, the generous, and the just,
Never again like sympathies to prove!
Did ardent Genius, then, so vainly move?
Taste, art inventive, labour for a shroud?
Was it for this that poesy was fired,
And Music, mystic warbler!  breath'd aloud
Her prophecy of Heaven, and seraph dreams inspired?

Well might the Persian monarch weep his host,
Clad	in their glittering pomp, death's future prey!
Why, vent'rous Gama, tempt an unknown coast?
Why, Abyssinian wanderer, fondly stray?
Nor Nile nor Ganges can revive your clay,
If "Macedonia's madman" (truly styled!)
And Shakspeare, conqu'ring Fancy's boundless realm,
He whose ambition walk'd the starry wild,
And he who soar'd beyond &mdash; one night eternal whelm!

Forth new array'd the lilies of the field,
That "toil not, spin not," lead their annual train;
The tufted wild-thyme winter had conceal'd,
Listens to Spring, and scents the breeze again
But man, the reasoning tenant of the plain,
No vernal voice awakens from the dead&mdash;
His broken clay-house mingles with the soil&mdash;
Eternity is booming o'er his head,
The place that knew him once, for him no more shall smile.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Ha!  what sad dissonance of woe was there!
Britannia shrieking to her distant realms,
While half earth's caverns echo her despair;
Pride droops, hate dies, a common shock o'erwhelms
All diverse hearts that human passions share!
A mighty nation's hope and joy lies dead&mdash;
Europe's fair Cynosure, nor her alone&mdash;
One blast the blossom and the bud hath shed&mdash;
The teeming grave claims both, unreck'd the needy throne!

Thou, by one flash of Fate relentless, reft
Of love and empire &mdash; pity writhes for thee!
Of all thy hopes, bright Iris, what is left
Save the sad dews of weeping constancy?
To gaze on scenes she never more shall see,
Hang on thy heart each relic that she wore,
Word she last breath'd, or look last beaming love&mdash;
These are but subject griefs &mdash; thine one pang more&mdash;
To balance love with realms, and know, how far above!

O!  make an altar of her sacred tomb,
And vow upon it a life-lasting grief!
Vi'lets less bright than sweet &mdash; the rose perfume
That dies not with the pale and scatter'd leaf,
And every fragrance rare, and every tincture brief
With daily duty, shed profusely there!
Spiced like the ashes of Arabia's bird,
They'll medicate all souls that breathe that air,
To higher, holier aims, than e'er ambition stirr'd;

For who, that fatal night so long desir'd,
Saw the destroying angel hov'ring nigh?
Not that when Egypt's first-born sons expir'd,
Rais'd to mysterious heav'n a wilder cry,
Nor sunk the oft-harden'd heart more helplessly!
The great &mdash; the fair &mdash; the young &mdash; Death could not charm,
Nor palace-guards secure, nor sheltering love;
Not all that waste of worth could Heav'n disarm;
Then die!  sand-clinging hopes!  scorn, more than ruth, ye move!

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

For gain or fame to visit realms unknown,
(Gain others reap, fame few survive to hear),
What band of travellers pass in silence on,
Nor oft and daily, anxious councils share?
Each communes largely on their common care,
Each tells his hopes, his doubts &mdash; thus all provide
By thought's exchange some dole in wisdom's aid;
Travellers of Death's dark valley!  wand'ring wide
From wisdom's chart celestial &mdash; wherefore have ye strayed?

Why will ye die?  Alas!  with coward heart,
Like children in the dark, you close your eyes,
To hide your own chimeras; &mdash; all your art
To cheat, not heal, the terrors that arise
At nature's friendly bidding, you devise;
Then talk, laugh, revel, carrol to the moon,
Till clouds and darkness settle on the soul;
Too late for wisdom &mdash; for remorse too soon&mdash;
The day-star dawns afar, and shews the distanc'd goal!

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

'Twas need that man should fear, when Belial's wrath
Unchain'd, but unsuspect, besets his way;
Within, &mdash; worse foe, &mdash; without the world he hath,
All, all in league his purpose to bewray&mdash;
Earth hems him round, and heavn's too far away!
Too high that throne of stars to rule his soul,
By clouds of sense obscur'd, and pleas'd to rove
This flowery Eden!  did not fear controul:&mdash;
Hallow the fear of death, &mdash; twas giv'n to man in love!

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
