Nor shrieking owls were heard, nor crowing cocks,
But sleep and silence held their peaceful reign;
No foot that stirr'd, save of the prowling fox,
Or hare that crop'd the verdure of the plain:

The plain, where, on a gibbet high in air
The Murd'rer hangs; and veers with every wind,
The gaze of reckless fools, the maiden's fear,
But moral lesson to the thoughtful mind.

At that drear time of night the flitting Ghost
That once had dwelt within those foul remains,
Hov'ring around, now view'd the fatal spot,
Now mark'd with anguish the impris'ning chains.

Oh, dire effect of passion and excess!
Such are, she cries, the triumphs you obtain,
These iron wreaths, O guilt, thy temples press,
And this the pile thou rear'st with so much pain.

Ah, much-lov'd carcass once!  now doom'd to bear
The North hard-driving, and the biting East;
Thy guardian I!  corruption learn to spare,
Flee hungry ravens the forbidden feast.

But why thy far less dreadful lot deplore?
Ye hungry ravens, make your putrid meal;
Past thy last fatal struggle, thou no more
Nor driving North, nor biting East canst feel.

Those feet that once my active impulse own'd,
That impious hand, whose aim, alas!  too just
Obey'd my rage (Oh, be that rage aton'd)
Depriv'd of sense, shall moulder into dust.

Vain is the hope of sinking into nought,
Thy envied privilege to me deny'd;
Oh!  could I taste like thee Oblivion's draught,
To hush my fears, and lay my griefs aside.

Driven with winds, or drench'd in misty air,
I, like a wounded stag, no rest can find;
Guilt's arrows deep infix'd about me bear,
Whilst angry Justice presses hard behind.

Yet, impious wretch, that dar'st to bound what knows
No bounds &mdash; the tender mercies of thy God;
Kiss the inflicted, that in soft repose
Ev'n thou, perhaps, may'st bless th' averted rod.
