Two prettie Rills doe meet, and meeting make
Within one vally, a large silver lake:
About whose bankes the fertile mountainees stood,
In ages passed bravely crownd with wood;
Which lending Cold-sweet-shadowes, gave it grace,
To be accounted Cynthia's Bathing place.
And from her father Neptunes brackish Court
Faire Thetis thither often would resort,
Attended by the Fishes of the Sea,
Which in those sweeter waters came to plea.
There, would the daughter of the Sea-God dive;
And thither came the Land-Nymphs every Eve,
To wait upon her:  bringing for her browes,
Rich garlands of sweet flowres, and Beechy boughs.

For pleasant was that Poole, and neere it, then
Was neither rotten Mersh, nor boggy Fen.
It was nor overgrowne with boystrous Sedge,
Nor grew there rudely then along the edge,
A bending Willow, nor a pricky Bush,
Nor broadleafd Flag, nor Reed, nor knotty Rush.
But here, wel order'd was a grove with Bowers:
There grassy plots set round about with Flowers.
Here, you might (through the water) see the land
Appeare, strowd o'er with white or yellow sand.
Yon, deeper was it; and the wind by whiffes,
Would make it rise, and wash the little cliffes,
On which, oft pluming sate (unfrighted than)
The gagling Wildgoose, and the snow-white Swan:
With all those flockes of Fowles, which to this day,
Upon those quiet waters breed, and play.

For, though those excellences wanting be,
Which once it had; it is the same, that we
By Transposition name the Ford of Arle.
And out of which along a Chalky Marle
That River trils, whose waters wash the Fort,
In which brave Arthur kept his royall Court.
North-east (not far from this great Poole) there lies
A tract of Beechy mountaines, that arise
With leasurely-ascending to such height,
As from their tops the warlike Ile of Wight,
You in the Oceans bosome may espie,
Though neere two hundred furlongs thence it lie.
The pleasant way, as up those hils you clime,
Is strewed o'er, with Marjorame, and Thyme,
Which growes unset.  The hedge-rowes do not want
The Cowslip, violet, Primrose, nor a plant
That freshly sents:  as Birch both greene and tall;
Low Sallowes, on whose bloomings Bees do fall.
Fair Woodbinds which, about the hedges twine,
Smooth Privet, and the sharp, sweete Eglantine.
With many moe, whose leaves and blossomes faire,
The Earth adorne, and oft perfumes the ayre.

When you unto the highest doe attaine;
An intermixture both of Wood and plain,
You shall behold:  which (though aloft it lye)
Hath downes for sheepe, and fields for husbandry.
So much (at least) as little needeth more,
If not enough to marchandize their store.

In every Rowe hath Nature planted there,
Some banquet, for the hungry passenger.
For here, the Hasle-nut and Filberd growes;
There Bulloes, and a little further Sloes.
On this hand, standeth a faire weilding-tree;
On that, large thickets of blacke Cherries be.
The shrubbie fields are Raspice-Orchards there,
The new-fel'd woods, like Strabery-gardens are:
And had the King of Rivers blest those hills
With some small number of such prettie Rills
As flow elsewhere, Arcadia had not seene,
A sweeter plot of Earth than this had beene.

For what offence this Place was scanted so
Of springing waters, no record doth show:
Nor have they old tradition left that tels;
But till this day, at fiftie fathome Wels
The Shepherds drink.  And strange it was to heare
Of any Swaine that ever lived there,
Who either in a Pastorall-Ode had skill,
Or knew to set his fingers to a quill.
For, rude they were who there inhabited,
And to a dull contentment being bred,
They no such Art esteem'd, nor tooke much heed
Of any thing, the world without them did.

E'en there; and in the least frequented place
Of all these mountaines, is a little space
Of pleasant ground hemd in with dropping trees,
And those so thicke, that Phoebus scarcely sees,
The earth they grow on once in all the yeere,
Nor what is done among the shaddowes there.
Along those lovely pathes (where never came
Report of Pan, or of Apollo's name,
Nor rumour of the Muses till of late)
Some Nymphs were wandring; and by chance, or Fate
Upon a Laund arrived, where they met
The little flocke of Pastor Philaret.
They were a troupe of Beauties knowne well nigh
Through all the Plaines of happy Britany.
A Shepherds lad was he, obscure and young,
Who (being first that ever there had sung)
In homely Verse, expressed Countrey loves;
And onely told them to the Beechy groves:
As if to sound his name he never meant
Beyond the compasse that his Sheep-walke went.

They saw not him; nor them perceived he:
For, in the branches of a Maple-tree
He shrouded sate, and taught the hollow hill
To Eccho foorth the Musique of his quill:
Whose tatling voice redoubled so the sound,
That where he was conceald, they quickly found.
And there, they heard him sing a Madrigall,
That soone betrayd his cunning to them all.

Full rude it was, no doubt, but such a Song,
Those rusticke, and obscured shades among,
Was never heard (they say) by any eare;
Untill his Muses had inspir'd him there.
Though meane and plain, his Country habit seemd,
Yet by his Song the Ladies rightly deemd
That either he had traveiled abrode,
Where Swaines of better knowledge make abode,
Or else, that some brave Nimph who used that Grove,
Had dained to inrich him, with her love.

Approaching nearer, therefore, to this Swaine,
They him saluted; and he, them againe:
In such good fashion, as well seemd to be
According to their state and his degree.
Which greetings, being passed; and much chat,
Concerning him, the place, with this and that,
He to an Arbor doth those beauties bring;
Where he them prayes to sit, they him to sing:
And to expresse that untaught Country Art,
In setting forth the Mistresse of his hart,
Which they oreheard him practise, when unseene,
He thought no eare had witnesse of it beene.

At first (as much unable) he refusd;
And seemed willing to have been excusde
From such a taske.  For, trust me, Nimphs (quoth he)
I would not purposely uncivill be,
Nor churlish in denying what you crave;
But, as I hope Great Pan my flocke will save,
I rather wish, that I might heard of none,
Enjoy my Musick, by my selfe alone:
Or, that the murmurs of some little Flood,
(Joind with the friendly Ecchoes of the wood)
Might be th' impartiall Umpires of my wit,
Then vent it, where the world might heare of it.
And doubtlesse, I had sung lesse loud while-ere,
Had I but thought of any such so neere.
Not that I either wish obscurified,
Her matchlesse Beauty; or desire to hide
Her sweet perfections.  For, by Love I sweare,
The utmost happinesse I ayme at here,
Is but to compasse worth enough to raise
A high-built Trophee equall with her praise.

Which (fairest Ladies) I shall hope in vaine:
For, I was meanly bred on yonder Plaine.
And, though I can well proove my Blood to be
Deriv'd from no ignoble Stems to me:
Yet Fate and Time them so obscur'd and crost,
That with their Fortunes their esteeme is lost.
And whatsoere repute I strive to win,
Now from my selfe alone, it must begin.
For, I have nor estate, nor friends, nor fame,
To purchase either credit to my name,
Or gaine a good Opinion; though I doe
Ascend the height I shall aspire unto.

If any of those virtues yet I have,
Which honour to my Predecessors gave,
Ther's all that's left me.  And though some contemn
Such needy Jewels; yet it was for them,
My Faire-one did my humble suit affect,
And dayned my adventurous love respect.
And by their helpe, I passage hope to make
Through such poore things, as I dare undertake.

But, you may say; what goodly thing alas!
Can my despised meannesse bring to passe?
Or what great Monument of honour raise
To Virtue, in these Vice abounding days?
In which (a thousand times) more honor finds,
Ignoble gotten meanes, then noble minds?
Indeed, the world affoordeth small reward
For honest minds; and therefore her regard
I seeke not after:  neither do I care,
If I have blisse, how others thinke I fare.
For, so my thoughts have rest, it yrkes not me,
Though none but I doe know how blest they be.
Here therefore, in these groves and hidden plaines,
I pleased sit alone:  and many straines
I caroll to my selfe, these hills among:
Where no man comes to interrupt my Song.
Whereas, if my rude layes make knowne I should,
Beyond their home; perhaps, some Carpers would,
(Because they have not heard from whence we be)
Traduce, abuse, and scoffe both them and me.
For, if our great and learned Shepheards (who
Are grac't with wit, and fame, and favours to,)
With much adoe, escape uncensurd may;
What hopes have I to passe unscoft I pray,
Who yet unto the Muses am unknown?
And live unhonour'd, heere among mine owne?

A gadding humour seldome taketh me,
To range out further than yonn mountaines be:
Nor hath applausive Rumour borne my name
Upon the spreading wings of sounding Fame.
Nor can I thinke (faire Nymphs) that you resort
For other purpose, than to make a sport
At that simplicitie which shall appear
Among the rude untutor'd Shepheards here.

I know that you my Noble Mistresse ween
At best, a homely Milk-maid on the Greene;
Or some such Country lass, as tasked stayes
At servile labour untill Holy dayes.
For poore mens vertues so neglected grow,
And are now prized at a rate so low,
As tis impossible, you should bee brought,
To let it with beleefe possesse your thought,
That any Nymph whose love might worthy be;
Would daigne to cast respective eyes on me.

You see I live, possessing none of those
Gay things, with which the world enamor'd grows.
To woo a Courtly Beautie, I have neither
Rings, Bracelets, Jewels, nor a Scarfe, nor Feather.
I use no double dyed Cloth to weare;
No Scrip embroydered richly doe I bear:
No silken Belt, nor Sheephooke layd with pearles,
To win me favour from the Shepherds Girles.
No place of office, or Command I keepe,
But this my little Flocke of homely sheepe.
And in a word; the summe of all my pelfe
Is this; I am the Master of my selfe.

No doubt; in Courts of Princes you have beene,
And all the pleasures of the Palace seene.
There, you beheld brave Courtly passages,
Between Heroes and their Mistresses.
You, there perhaps (in presence of the King)
Have heard his learned Bards and Poets sing.
And what contentment, then, can wood, or field,
To please your curious understandings yeeld?
I know, you walked hither, but to proove,
What silly Shepheards doe conceive of love:
Or to make triall how our simplenesse
Can passions force, or beauties power expresse:
And when you are departed, you will joy,
To laugh, or descant on the Shepheards boy.

But yet (I vow) if all the Art I had
Could any more esteeme, or glory add
To her unmatched worth; I would not weigh
What you intended.  Prethee lad, quoth they,
Distrustfull of our Courtsie doe not seeme.
Her Noblenesse can never want esteeme,
Nor thy concealed Measures be disgrac't,
Though in a meaner person they were plac't:
If thy too modestly reserved Quill
But reach that height, which we suppose it will.

Thy meannesse or obscurenesse cannot wrong,
The Nymph thou shalt eternize in thy Song.
For, as it higher reares thy glory, that
A noble Mistresse thou hast aimed at:
So, more unto her honour it will proove,
That whilst deceaving shadowes others move,
Her constant eyes, could passe unmoved by,
The subtill times bewitching bravery;
And those obscured virtues love in thee,
That with despised meannesse clouded be.
Now then, for her sweet sake, whose Beautious eye,
Hath filled thy soule with heavenly Poesie,
Sing in her praise some new inspired straine:
And, if within our power there shall remaine,
A favour to be done may pleasure thee:
Aske, and obtaine it, whatsoe'er it be.

Faire Ladies, quoth the lad, such words as those,
Compell me can: and, therewithall he rose;
Return'd them thanks, obeisance made, and than,
Downe sate againe, and thus to sing began.

You, that at a blush can tell,
Where the best perfections dwell;
And the substance can conjecture,
By a shaddow, or a Picture:
Come, and try, if you by this;
Know my Mistresse, who she is.

For, though I am farre unable
Here to match Apelles table,
Or draw Zeuxes, cunning Lines,
Who, so painted Bacchus Vines,
That the hungry Byrds did muster,
Round the counterfeited Cluster.
Though, I vaunt not to inherit
Petrarchs, yet unequal'd spirit;
Nor to quaffe the sacred Well,
Half so deepe as Astrophill:
Though, the much-commended Celia,
Lovely Laura, Stella, Delia,
(Who in former times excell'd)
Live in Lines unparaled;
Making us beleeve 'twere much,
Earth should yeeld another such.

Yet, assisted but by Nature,
I essay to paint a Creature
Whose rare worth, in future yeares
Shall be praysd, as much as theirs.
Nor let any thinke amisse,
That I have presumed this:
For a gentle Nimph is shee,
And hath often honor'd me.
Shees, a noble sparke of light,
In each part so exquisit,
Had she in times passed beene,
They had made her, beauties Queene.

Then, shall cowardly despaire,
Let the most unblemisht faire,
For default of some poore Art
(Which her favour may impart)
And the sweetest Beauty fade,
That was ever borne or made?
Shall, of all the faire ones, shee
Onely so unhappy be;
As to live in such a Time,
In so rude, so dull a Clime,
Where no spirit can ascend
High enough, to apprehend
Her unprized excellence,
Which lies hid from common sense?
Never shall a staine so vile
Blemish this, our Poets Ile.
I my selfe, will rather runne,
And seeke out for Helicon.
I, will wash, and make me cleane,
In the waves of Hyppocrene:
And in spite of Fortunes barres,
Climbe the Hill that braves the starres.
Where, if I can get no Muse
That will any skill infuse,
(Or my just attempt prefer)
I will make a Muse of Her:
Whose kind heat shall soone distill,
Art, into my ruder quill.
By her favour, I will gaine
Help to reach so rare a Straine:
That the learned Hils shall wonder,
How the untaught vallies under,
Met with Raptures so divine,
Without knowledge of the NINE.

I, that am a Shepheards Swaine,
Piping on the lowly plaine,
And no other Musique can,
Than what learn'd I have of Pan,
I, who never sung the Layes,
That deserve Apollo's bayes,
Hope not onely, here to frame,
Measures, which shall keepe Her name,
From the spite of wasting Times,
But (enshrin'd in sacred Rimes)
Place her, where her forme divine,
Shall to after ages shine:
And without respect of Odds,
Vye renowne with Demy-Gods.

Then, whilst of her praise I sing,
Hearken, Vally, Grove and Spring;
Listen to me sacred Fountaines,
Solitarie Rocks, and Mountaines:
Satyres, and you wanton Elves,
That doe nightly sport your selves.
Shepheards, you that on the Reede,
Whistle while your lambes doe feed:
Aged Woods, and Floods, that know,
What hath beene long times agoe.
Your more serious Notes among,
Hear how I can in my Song,
Set a Nimphs perfection forth:
And when you have heard her worth;
Say, if such another Lasse,
Ever known to mortall was.

Listen, Lordlings; you that most
Of your outward honors boast.
And you Gallants; that thinke scorne,
We to lowly fortunes borne,
Should attaine to any graces,
Where, you looke for sweet embraces.

See; if all those vanities,
Whereon your affection lies,
Or the Titles, or the power,
By your Fathers virtues your,
Can your Mistresses enshrine,
In such state, as I will mine:
Who am forced, to importune
Favours, in despite of Fortune.

Beauties listen; chiefly you,
That yet know not Virtues due.
You, that thinke there are no sports,
Nor no honours but in Courts.
(Though of thousands there lives not
Two, but dye and are forgot:)
See, if any palace yeelds
Ought more glorious, than the Fields.
And consider well, if we
May not as high-flying be
In our thoughts, as you that sing
In the Chambers of a King.
See, if our contented minds,
Whom Ambition never blinds:
(We, that clad in home-spun gray,
On our owne sweet Meadowes play)
Cannot honour (if we please)
Where we list as well as these.
Or as well of worth approve;
Or with equall passions love.
See, if beauties may not touch
Our soone-loving hearts as much:
Or our services effect
Favours, with as true respect
In your good conceits to rise,
As our painted Butterflies.

And you Fairest give her roome,
When your Sexes pride doth come:
For that Subject of my song,
I invoke these Groves among,
To be witnesse of the Layes,
Which I caroll in her praise.
And because shee soone will see,
If my Measures faultie be;
Whilst I chaunt them, let each Rime
Keepe a well-proportion'd time:
And with straines that are divine,
Meet her thoughts in every line.
Let each accent there, present
To her Soule a new content;
And with ravishings so ceaze her,
She may feele the height of pleasure.

You enchanting spells, that lye,
Lurking in sweet Poesie,
(And to none else will appeare,
But to those that worthy are)
Make Her know there is a power
Ruling in these Charmes of your;
That transcends (a thousand heights)
Ordinary mens delights:
And can leave within her brest,
Pleasures, not to be exprest.
Let her linger, on each straine,
As if shee would heare't againe;
And were loth to part from thence,
Till shee had the quintessence,
Out of each conceit shee meets,
And had stord her, with those sweets.

Make her, by your Art to see:
I, that am her Swaine, was he,
Unto whom all beauties here,
Were alike, and equall deare.
That I could of freedome boast,
And of favours with the most:
Yet, now (nothing more affecting)
Sing of Her, the rest neglecting.

Make her heart, with full Compassion,
Judge the merit of true passion;
And, as much my love prefer,
As I strive to honour Her.

Lastly; you, that will (I know)
Heare me, wh'ere you should or no.
You, that seeke to turne all Flowers,
By your breathes infectious powers,
Into such ranke loathsome weedes,
As your dunghill nature breeds.
Let your hearts be chast, or here
Come not, till you purge them cleare.
Marke; and marke then, what is worst:
For, what ere it seem at first;
If you bring a modest minde,
You shall nought immodest finde.

But, if any too severe
Happ to lend a partiall eare;
Or out of his blindnesse yawne,
Such a word, as Oh profane:
Let him know thus much from me,
If here's ought profane, tis he;
Who applies these excellences,
Onely to the touch of senses:
And, dimm sighted, cannot see
Where the soule of this, may bee.

Yet, that no offence may grow,
Tis their choice, to stay, or goe.
Or, if any for despite,
Rather comes, then for delight:
For his presence Ile not pray,
Nor his absence:  come he may.
Critticks shall admitted be,
Though I know theile carpe at me.
For I neither feare nor care,
What in this, their censures are.

If the Verse heere used, be
Their dislike; it liketh me.
If my Methode they deride,
Let them know, Love is not tide
In his free Discourse, to chuse
Such strict rules as Arts-men use.
These may prate of Love; but they,
Know him not:  for Hee will play
From the matter, now and then,
Off and on, and off again.

If this Prologue tedious seeme,
Or the rest too long they deeme:
Let them know, my love they win,
Though they goe ere I begin,
Just as if they should attend me,
Till the last, and there commend me.
For, I will for no mans pleasure
Change a Syllable or measure:
Neither for their praises adde
Ought to mend what they thinke bad:
Since it never was my fashion
To make worke of Recreation.

Pedants shall not tye my straines,
To our Antique Poets vaines;
As if we, in latter dayes,
Knew to love, but not to praise.
Being borne as free as these,
I will sing, as I shall please;
Who, as well new paths may run,
As the best before have done.
I disdaine to make my Song,
For their pleasures short or long.
If I please Ile end it here:
If I list Ile sing this yeere.
And, though none regard of it,
By my selfe I pleas'd can sit,
And, with that contentment cheare me,
As if halfe the world did heare me.

But because I am assured,
All are either so conjured,
As they will my Song attend,
With the patience of a friend;
Or (at least) take note, that I
Care not much:  now willingly
I these goodly Colours lay,
Wind, nor raine, shall weare away.
But retaine their purest glasse,
When the Statues made of brasse,
For some Princes more renowne,
Shall be wholly overthrowne:
Or (consum'd with cankred rust)
Lie neglected in the dust.

And my Reason gives direction,
(When I sing of such perfection)
First, those beauties to declare,
Which (though hers) without her are.
To advance her fame, I find,
Those are of a triple kind.
Priviledges she hath store,
At her birth, since, and before.
From before her birth, the fame,
Shee of high discents may claime;
(Whose wel-gotten honors, may
Her deserving more display)
For, from heavenly race shee springs,
And from high and mightie Kings.

At her birth; shee was by Fate
In those Parents fortunate,
Whose estates and virtues stood,
Answerable to their Blood.

Then, the Nation, Time, and Place,
To the rest may adde some grace.
For the People, with the Clime,
And the fashions of the time;
(In all which she hath been blest,
By enjoying them at best)
Do not onely mend the features,
But oft times make better natures.
Whereas, those who hap not so,
Both deform'd, and ruder grow.

In these Climes, and latter dayes,
To deserve sweet Beauties praise,
(Where so many females dwell,
That each seemeth to excell)
Is more glory twentie-fold,
Then it was in dayes of old,
When our ordinary Faire ones
Might have been esteemed rare ones;
And have made a subject fit
For their bravest Poets wit.
Little Rush-lights, or a sparke,
Shineth fairely in the darke:
And, to him occasion gives
That from sight of lesser lives
To adore it:  yet the Ray
Of one Torch will take away
All the light of twentie more
That shin'd very well before.
So, those pettie Beauties, which
Made the times before us rich;
Though but sparkles seemd a flame
Which hath been increast by Fame,
And their true affections, who
Better never liv'd to know.
Whereas, her if they had seene,
Shee had sure adored beene,
And taught Ages past, to sing
Sweeter in their Sonneting.

Such a Ray, so cleare, so bright,
Had out shined all the light
Of a thousand such as theirs,
Who were then esteemed Starres;
And would have enlighten'd, neere
Half the worlds wide Hemisphere.
Shee is fairest, that may passe
For a faire one, where the Lasse
Trips it on the Countrie greene,
That may equall Spartas Queene.
(Where in every street you see)
Throngs of Nymphs and Ladies be,
That are faire enough to move
Angels, and enamour Jove.
Shee must matchlesse features bring
That now mooves a Muse to sing,
When as one small Province may
Shew more Beauties in a day,
Than the halfe of Europe could,
Breed them in an age of old.
Such is shee, and such a lot
Hath her rare perfection got.

Since her birth; to make the colour
Of so true a Beautie fuller;
And to give a better grace
To that sweetnesse in the face:
Shee, hath all the furthrance had,
Noble educations add.
And not onely knoweth all
Which our Ladies, Courtship call,
With those knowledges, that doe
Grace her sex, and sute thereto:
But shee hath attain'd to find,
(What is rare with womankind)
Excellences, whereby she
May in soule delighted be;
And reape more contentment, than
One of twentie thousand can.

By this meanes, hath better'd bin,
All without her, and within.
For, it hath by adding Arts,
To addorne her native parts,
Raised to a noble flame,
(Which shall lighten forth her fame)
Those deare sparkes of sacred fire,
Which the Muses did inspire
At her birth:  that she compleat,
Might with them befit a seat.

But, perhaps I doe amiss,
To insist so long on this.
These, are superficiall things;
And but slender shaddowings,
To the worke I have in hand.
Neither can you understand,
What her excellence may be,
Till her selfe describ'd you see.
Nor can mine, or any penn,
Paint her halfe so lovely then,
As she is indeed.  For, here
Might those Deities appeare,
Which young Paris view'd, at will,
Naked, upon Ida hill;
That I from those three might take,
All their beauties One to make;
(Those, no question well compact,
Would have made up one exact)
Something yet, we misse of might,
To expresse her sweetnesse right;
Juno's majestie would fit;
Venus beauty, Pallas wit
Might have brought to patterne hers,
In some shew'd particulers.
But, they never can expresse,
Her whole frame or worthinesse:
With those excellences, which
Make both soule and body rich.

Pallas sometimes was untoward,
Venus wanton, Juno froward:
Yea, all three infected were,
With such faults as women are.
And though falsely Deifi'd,
Fraileties had, which shee'le deride.

By herselfe, must therefore she,
Or by nothing pattern'd, be.
And I hope to paynt her so,
By her selfe, that you shall know,
I have serv'd no common Dame,
Of meane worth or vulger fame,
But a Nimph that's fairer than,
Pen, or Pencill, portrait can.
And to morrow if you stray,
Back againe this uncoth way:
I my simple art will show:
But, the time prevents me now.
For, except at yonder glade,
All the Laund is under shade.
That, before these Ewes be told,
Those my Weathers in the fold,
Ten young Wainlings driven downe
To the well beneath the Towne,
And my Lambkins changed from
Brome leaze, to the Mead at home:
Twill be furre in night:  and so,
I shall make my father woe
For my stay, and be in feare
Some what is mischanced here.
On your way, Ile therefore bring you,
And a Song or two Ile sing you,
Such as I (halfe in despaire)
Made when first I woo'd my Faire:
Whereunto my Boy shall play,
That my voyce assist, it may.

1.
Come, my Muse, if thou disdaine,
All my comforts are bereft me;
No delight doth now remaine,
I nor friend nor flocke have left me,
They are scattered on the plaine.

(Men, alas) are too severe,
And make scoffes at Lovers Fortunes;
Women, hearted like the Beare,
That regards not who importunes,
But, doth all in pieces teare.

If I should my sorrowes show
Unto Rivers, Springs, or fountaines,
They are senselesse of my woe;
So are groves, and rockes, and mountaines.
Then, oh whither shall I goe?

Meanes of harbour me to shield
From despaire; Ah, know you any?
For, nor Citie, Grange, nor Field
(Though they lend content to many)
Unto me, can comfort yeeld.

I have wept and sighed too,
For compassion to make triall:
Yea, done all that words can doe,
Yet have nothing but denyall.
What way is there then to wooe?

Shall I sweare, protest, and vow?
So have I done most extreamely.
Should I die?  I know not how.
For, from all attempts unseemely,
Love, and Virtue keepes me now.

I have heard that Time prevailes;
But I feare me tis a fable.
Time, and all endeavour failes;
To beare more, my heart's unable,
Yet none careth what it ayles.

Lines, to some have op't the dore,
And got entrance for affection.
Words well spoken, much implore
By the Gestures good direction:
But a Looke doth ten times more.

Tis the Eye that onely reades,
To the heart, love's deepest Lectures.
By a mooving looke it pleads,
More than common sence conjectures:
And, a way to pittie leades.

This, I knowing did observe,
(Both by Words, and Looks complayning)
Yet for pittie I may starve:
There's no hope of my obtaining;
Till I better can deserve.

Yea, and he that thinkes to winne
By desert, may bee deceived.
For, they who have worthiest bin,
Of their right have beene bereaved,
And a Groome admitted in.

Wherefore Muse, to thee I call;
Thou (since nothing else availes me)
Must redeeme mee from my thrall.
If thy sweet enchauntment failes me,
Then adieu, love, life, and all.

2.
Tell me my hart, what Thoughts these pantings move?
My Thoughts of LOVE.
What Flames are these, that set thee so on fire?
Flames of DESIRE.
What Meanes hast thou, contentment's floure to crop?
No Meanes but HOPE.
Yet let us feed on Hope, and Hope the best.
For, they amid their griefes are something blest;
Whose Thoughts, and Flames, and Meanes, have such free scope
They may at once, both LOVE, DESIRE, and HOPE.

But say; what Fruit will love at last obtaine?
Fruitlesse DISDAINE.
What will those Hopes prove, which yet seeme so faire?
Hopelesse DESPAIRE.
What End shall runne those passions out of breath?
An endlesse DEATH.
Oh can there be such crueltie in LOVE?
And doth my Fortune so ungentle prove,
She will no Fruit, nor Hope, nor End bequeath,
But cruellest DISDAIN, DESPAIRE, and DEATH?

Then what new Studie shall I now apply?
Studie to DIE.
How might I end my Care, and dye content?
Care to REPENT.
And what good Thoughts may make my end more holy?
Thinke on thy FOLLY.
Yes, so I will; and since my Fate can give
No Hope, but ever without Hope to live,
My Studies, Cares, and Thoughts, Ile all apply
To weigh my FOLLY well, REPENT and DIE.

3.
Sad Eyes what doe you ayle
To be thus ill disposed?
Why doth your sleeping faile,
Now all mens else are closed?
Wast I, that nere did bow
In any servile dutie;
And will you make me, now,
A slave to Love and beautie?

What though thy Mistresse smile,
And in her love affects thee?
Let not her eye beguile,
I feare shee disrespects thee.
Doe not poore heart depend
On those vaine thoughts that fill thee;
Theyle faile thee in the end,
So must thy passions kill thee.

What hopes have I, that shee
Will hold her favours ever;
When so few women be,
That constant can persever?
What ere shee doe protest,
When Fortunes doe deceive me;
Then shee, with all the rest,
I feare, alas!  will leave me.

Whilst youth, and strength remains,
With art that may commend her;
Perhaps, she nought disdaines,
Her servant should attend her.
But, it is one to ten,
If crosses overtake me;
Shee will not know me then,
But scorne, and so forsake mee.

Shall then in earnest truth,
My carefull eyes observe her?
Shall I consume my youth,
And short my time to serve her?
Shall I, beyond my strength,
Let passion's torments proove me,
To heare her say at length,
Away, I cannot love thee?

Oh, rather let me dye,
Whilst I thus gentle find her;
Twere worse than death, if I,
Should finde shee proves unkinder.
One frowne (though but in jest)
Or one unkindnes, feigned,
Would rob me of more rest,
Than ere could be regained.

But, in her eyes I finde,
Such signes of pittie mooving,
She cannot be unkinde:
Nor erre, nor faile in loving.
And, on her forehead, this,
Seemes written to relieve me;
My heart no joy shall misse,
That Love, or Shee, can give me.

Which, if I finde, I vow,
My service shall persever:
The same that I am now,
I will continue ever.
No others high degree,
Nor beauteous looke shall change me.
My love shall constant bee,
And no estate estrange me.

When other noble Dames
By greater men attended;
Shall with their Lives, and Names,
Have all their glories ended;
With fairest Queenes shall she,
Sit sharing equall glory:
And Times to come, shall be,
Delighted with our Story.

In spite of others hates,
More honour I will doe her,
Than those that with Estates,
And helpes of Fortune wooe her.
Yea, that true worth I spie,
Though Monarchs strove to grace it,
They should not reach more hie,
Than I dare hope to place it.

And though I never vaunt,
What favours are possessed,
Much lesse content I want,
Than if they were expressed.
Let others make their mirth
To blab each kisse, or toying;
I know no blisse on earth,
Like, secret Love enjoying.

And this shall be the worst,
Of all that can betide me;
If I, like some accurst,
Should finde my hopes deride me.
My Cares will not be long,
I know which way to mend them;
Ile thinke who did the wrong,
Sigh, breake my heart, and end them.


Haile faire beauties, and againe,
Haile to all your goodly traine.
What I promisd yesterday,
If it please you, heare yee may:
For, now once begun have I,
Sing I will, though none were by.
And, though freely on I runne,
Yet confused paths to shunne,
First, that part shall be disclos'd,
Thats of Elements compos'd.
There, the two unequall paire,
Water, Fire, Earth and Ayre.
(Each one suting a Complexion,)
Have so cunning a Commixtion,
As they, in proportion sweet,
With the rarest temper meete.
Either, in as much as needeth,
So as neither, ought exceedeth.
This pure substance, is the same,
Which the Body we doe name.
Were that, of immortall stuffe;
Tis refin'd and pure enough,
To be cald a Soule:  for sure,
Many Soules are not so pure.
I (that with a serious looke
Note of this rare moddel tooke)
Find, that Nature in their places,
So well couched all the Graces,
As the Curioust eies that be,
Can nor blot, nor blemish see.

Like a Pine it groweth streight,
Reaching an approved height:
And hath all the choice perfections,
That inflame the best affections.
In the motion of each part,
Nature seemes to strive with Art,
Which her gestures most shall blesse,
With the guifts of Pleasingnesse.

When she sits; me, thinkes, I see,
How all virtues fixed be,
In a frame; whose constant mould,
Will the same unchanged hold.
If you note her when she moves,
Cytherea drawne with doves:
May come learne such winning motions,
As will gaine to loves devotions,
More than all her painted wiles;
Such as teares, or sighs, or smiles.

Some, whose bodies want true graces,
Have sweete features in their faces;
Others, that doe misse them there,
Lovely are some other where;
And to our desires doe fitte,
In behaviour, or in witte;
Or some inward worth appearing,
To the soule, the soule endearing.
But, in her your eie may find,
All thats good in Womankind.
What in others we preferre,
Are but sundry parts of her:
Who, most perfect, doth present,
What might one, and all content.
Yea, he that in love still ranges,
And each day, or howrly changes;
(Had he judgement but to know,
What perfection in her grow)
There would find the spring of store,
Sweare a faith, and change no more.

Neither in the totall frame,
Is she onely void of blame;
But, each part survei'd a sunder,
Might beget both love and wonder.
If you dare to looke so high,
Or behold such majestie;
Lift your wondring eies and see
Whether ought can better'd be.

There's her Haire, with which Love angles,
And beholders eies intangles;
For, in those faire curled snares,
They are hampered unawares:
And compeld to sweare a duty,
To her sweete enthrauling beauty.
In my mind tis the most faire,
That was ever called haire,
Somewhat brighter than a browne,
And her Tresses waving downe,
At full length, and so dispread:
Mantles her from foote to head.

If you saw her Arched Brow,
Tell me pray, what Art knows how
To have made it in a line,
More exact, or more divine.
Beauty there may be descri'd,
In the height of all her pride,
Tis a meanly-rising plaine,
Whose pure white hath many a vaine,
Interlacing like the springs,
In the earths enamilings.
If the tale be not a toy
Of the little winged Boy;
When he meanes to strike a heart,
Thence, he throwes the fatall dart:
Which of wounds still makes a paire,
One of Love, one of Despaire.

Round her visage:  or so neare,
To a roundnes doth appeare,
That no more of length it takes,
Than what best proportion makes.

Short her Chinne is; and yet so,
As it is just long enow:
Lovelines, doth seeme to glory,
In that Cyrcling Promontory.
Pretty moving features skip
Twixt that hillocke and the lip:
If you note her, but the while
She is pleas'd to speake, or smile.

And her Lips (that knew no dulnes)
Full are, in the meanest fullnes:
Those, the leaves be, whose unfolding,
Brings sweete pleasures to beholding:
For, such pearles they doe disclose,
Both the Indies match not those:
Yet, are so in order placed,
As their whitenesse is more graced.
Each part is so well disposed,
And her dainty mouth composed,
So, as there is no distortion,
Misbeseemes that sweete proportion.

When her Ivorie Teeth she buries,
Twixt her two enticing cherries,
There appeares such pleasures hidden,
As might tempt what were forbidden.
If you looke againe the whiles,
She doth part those lips in smiles:
Tis as when a flash of light,
Breakes from heaven to glad the night.

Other parts my pencill crave,
But those lips I cannot leave;
For (me thinkes) I should goe,
And forsake those cherries so.
Ther's a kind of excellence,
Holds me from departing hence.
I would tell you what it were,
But my cunning failes me there.
They are like in their discloses,
To the mornings dewie roses:
That beside the name of faire,
Cast perfumes that sweet the Aire.
Melting soft her kisses be,
And had I, now, two or three;
(More inspired, by their touch)
I had praisd them twise as much.

But sweete Muses marke yee how,
Her faire eies doe checke me now,
That I seem'd to passe them so,
And their praises over goe:
And yet blame me not, that I
Would so faine have past them by.
For, I feared to have seene them,
Lest there were some danger in them.
Yet, such gentle lookes they lend,
As might make her foe, a friend;
And by their allurings move,
All beholders, unto love.
Such a power is also there,
As will keepe those thoughts in feare;
And command enough I saw,
To hold impudence in awe.
There, may he that knowes to love,
Read contents, which are above
Their ignoble aimes, who know
Nothing, that so high doth grow.
Whilst she me beholding is,
My heart dares not thinke amisse:
For, her sight most piercing cleare,
Seemes to see, whats written there.

Those bright Eies, that with their light,
Often times have blest my sight,
And in turning thence their shining
Left me in sad darkenes pining:
Are the rarest, loveliest gray,
And do cast forth such a ray;
As the man, that black prefers,
More would like this gray of hers.

When their matchles beames she shrouds,
Tis like Cynthia hid in Clouds.
If againe she shew them light,
Tis like morning after night.
And, tis worthy well beholding,
With how many a prettie folding,
Her sweet eye lids grace that faire,
Meanly fring'd with beaming haire:
Whereby, neatly overspread,
Those bright lamps are shaddowed.

Twixt the Eyes, no hollow place,
Wrinkle nor undecent space,
Disproportions her in ought,
Though by Envie, faults were sought.

On those Eye-browes never yet,
Did disdainfull scowling sit.
Love and Goodnesse gotten thither,
Sit on equall thrones together;
And doe throw just scorne on them,
That their government contemne.

Then (almost obscur'd) appeares
Those her Jewel-gracing Eares,
Whose owne Beauties more adorne,
Than the richest Pearle that's worne
By the proudest Persian Dames,
Or the best that Nature frames.
There, the voice (in love's meanders)
Those their pretty cirklings, wanders:
Whose rare turnings will admit,
No rude speech to enter it.

Stretching from mount Forhead lies,
Beauties Cape betwixt her eyes.
Which two Chrystall-passing lakes,
Love's delightfull Isthmus makes;
Neither more nor lesse extending
Then most meriteth commending.
Those, in whom that part hath beene,
Best deserving praises seene:
Or, (surveid without affection)
Came the neereest to perfection.
Would scarce handsome ones appeare,
If with her compar'd they were.
For, it is so much excelling,
That it passeth meanes of telling.

On the either side of this,
Loves most lovely Prospect is.
Those her smiling Cheekes, whose colour
Comprehends true Beautie fuller,
Than the curioust mixtures can,
That are made by art of Man.
It is Beauties Garden plot,
Where, as in a True-love knot,
So, the Snowy Lilly growes,
Mixed with the Crimson Rose,
That, as friends they joyned be.
Yet, they seeme to disagree,
Whether of the two shall raigne;
And the Lillies oft obtain
Greatest sway, unlesse a blush
Helpe the roses at a push.
Hollow fallings, none there are;
Ther's no wrinkle, ther's no scar:
Onely ther's a little Mole,
Which from Venus cheeke was stole.

If it were a thing in Nature
Possible, that any Creature
Might decaying life repaire
Onely by the helpe of Aire:
There were no such Salve for death,
As the balme of her sweet breath.
Or, if any humane power,
Might detaine the Soule an houre,
From the flesh to dust bequeathing,
It would linger on her breathing:
And be halfe in mind, that there;
More than mortall pleasures were.
And whose fortune were so faire,
As to draw so sweet an ayre,
Would no doubt, let sleighted lie
The perfumes of Arabie.
For the English Eglantine
Doth through envy of her, pine.
Violets, and Roses to;
Feares that she will them undoe.
And it seemes that in her brest,
Is compos'd the Phoenix nest.

But, descend awhile, mine eye.
See, if polisht Ivory,
Or the finest-fleeced flockes,
Or the whitest Albion Rocks;
For comparisons may stand,
To expresse that snowy hand.
When she drawes it from her glove,
It hath virtue to remove,
Or disperst; if there be ought,
Cloudeth the beholders thought.
If that palme but toucheth your,
You shall feele a secret power
Cheare your heart; and glad it more,
Though it droopt with griefe before.

Through the vaines disposed true
Crimson yeelds a Saphir hue:
Which adds grace, and more delight,
By embracing with the white.
Smooth, and moist, and soft, and tender,
Are her palmes; the fingers slender;
Tipt with mollified Pearle:
And if that transformed Girle,
Whose much cunning, made her dare,
With Joves daughter to compare,
Had that hand worne; maugre spight,
Shee had sham'd the Goddesse quite.
For, there is in every part,
Nature perfecter than Art.

These, were joyned to those Armes,
That were never made for harmes:
But, possesse the sweetest graces,
That may apt them for imbraces.
Like the Silver streames they be,
Which from some high hill we see
Clipping in a goodly Vale,
That grows prowd of such a thrall.

Neither Alabaster Rocks,
Pearl strow'd-shores, nor Cotswold flockes,
Nor the Mountaines tipt with snow,
Nor the milk-white Swannes of Po,
Can appeare so faire to me,
As her spotlesse shoulders be.
They are like some worke of state,
Cover'd with the richest plate:
And a presence have, that strike
With devotions, Goddess-like.

Twixt those shoulders (meanly spread)
To support that Globe-like head,
Riseth up her Necke; wherein,
Beautie seemeth to beginne
To disclose it selfe, in more
Tempting manner than before.
How, therein she doth excell,
(Though I would) I cannot tell:
For, I naught on earth espie,
That I may expresse it by.

There, should Lovers as in dutie,
Hange rich Trophes up to Beauty.
Tis proportion'd to a height,
That is even with delight.
Yet, it is a great deale higher,
Then to answere base desire.

Where the Necke hath end, begins
That smooth path, where loves close ginns
Are thicke placed to inthrall,
Such, as that way straggle shall.
There, a pleasing passage lies,
Farre beyond the sight of eies:
And much more delight containes,
Then the old Elyzian plaines.

Whatsoever others say,
There's alone the Milkie-way;
That to beauties walkes doth goe,
Which, if others came to know;
In possessing their delight,
They should never reach the height,
Of the pleasures which I share,
Whilst that those debarred are.

Yet (unspoken of) there rests,
Her two twinlike lovely Breasts,
Whose round-rising, pretty panting
I would tell, but art is wanting.
Words can never well declare,
Her faire sweete perfections there:
For, would measures give me leave
To expresse what I conceive,
I doe know I should goe neare
Halfe to ravish all that heare.
And, but that I learne to season,
What I apprehend with Feason,
It had made my Passions weight
Sincke me through my owne conceit.
There I finde so large a measure,
Of an unexpressed pleasure;
That my heart, through strong surmise,
In a pleasing fainting lies.

He that there may rest to prove,
Softer finds those beds of love,
Than the Cotton ripest growne;
Or fine pillowes of such downe,
As in time of Molting, fanns,
From the breasts of silver Swannes.
Those two sisters are a paire
Smooth alike, like soft, like faire;
If together they be vewed.
Yet if they a part be shewed,
That you touch, or see, seemes smoother;
Softer, fairer, then the other.

That the Colour may delight,
So much red as makes the white,
Purer seeme, is shed among:
And then, here, and there, along,
Runnes a Saphire-Mine, whose blew
Shaddowd, makes so brave a shew
On those lillie mounts, as tho,
Beauties simples there did grow.
In the vale, twixt either hill,
Lies Desire in ambush still;
And surprizeth every eie,
Which doth that way dare to pry.

There, is sure the twy-top Hill,
Where the Poets, learne their skill.
Thats Parnassus where the Muses,
Chast, and wise Minerva uses.
Her two Cherrilets are those,
Whence the pleasantst Nectar flowes:
And no fruits ere equall'd these,
Fetcht from the Hesperides.

Once, as Cynthia's games she Chased,
And for Aire, left halfe unlased,
Her light summer-robe of greene,
(Beauties safe, but slender skreene)
Unawares, I partly spide,
That faire Lille field unhid,
Which you may her Belly name;
Yet, nor she, nor I, to blame.
For, it was but what mine eie,
Might behold with modestie.

Tis a faire and matchlesse Plaine,
Where unknowne delights remaine,
Tis the store-house wherein, Pleasure,
Hides the richest of her treasure.
Which, true Modestie (in ward)
Keepes with a continuall guard,
Of such Virtues; as shee's sure,
No corruption can allure.

There they say (for mind it well)
I doe this by hearsay, tell,
Grows her Navell, which doth seeme,
Like some Jewel of esteeme:
With so wondrous cunning wrought,
That an injury tis thought:
Such a beauty, with the rest,
(Should unknowne) be unexprest.

Somewhat else there is, thats hidden,
Which to name I am forbidden:
Neither have I ever pried,
After that should be unspied.
Never shall my Maiden-Muse,
So herselfe, and me abuse,
As to sing what I may feare,
Will offend the Choicest eare.
Though I know, if none be by
But true friends to Modestie,
I might name each part at will,
And yet no mans thought be ill.

Yet, for feare loose hearers may,
Judge amisse, if more I say:
Ile descend to shunn all blame,
To the Pillers of this Frame.
Where, though I nere aimd so high
As her daintie youthfull Thigh;
(Whose rare softnes, smothnes, fulnes,
Being knowne, would teach my dullnes
Such a straine, as might befit,
Some brave Tuscan Poets wit)
Once a sawcie bush I spide,
Plucke her silken skirts aside;
So discovered unto me,
All those beauties to the knee.
And, before the thornes entanglings,
Had let goe the Silver spanglings,
I perceivd the curious knitting
Of those joynts were well befitting;
Such a Noble piece of worke,
Mongst whose turnings, seem'd to lurke,
Much to entertaine the sight,
With new objects of delight.

Then the Legge for shape as rare,
Will admit of no compare.
Streight it is; the Anckle leane,
Full the Calfe, but in the meane:
And the slender Foote doth fit,
So each way to suit with it,
As she nothing lesse excells
Therein, then in all things els.
Yea from Head to Foote, her feature,
Shewes her an unblemisht Creature:
In whom love with reason, might,
Finds so matchlesse a Delight.
That more cannot be acquired,
Nor a greater blisse desired.

Yet if you will rest an howre,
Under yonder shady bowre:
I, anon my Muse will raise
To a higher pitch of praise.
But a while with Raspice-berries,
Strawberries, ripe Peares, and Cherries,
(Such as these our Groves doe beare)
We will coole our palats there.
And those homely Cates among,
Now and then a Past'rall Song,
Shall my Lad, here, sing, and play:
Such, as you had yesterday.

1.
A Lad whose faith will constant prove,
And never know an end:
Late by an oversight in love,
Displeas'd his dearest friend.
For which, incens'd shee did retake,
The favours which he wore;
And said, he never for her sake,
Should weare, or see them more.

The griefe whereof, how neere it went,
And how unkindly tooke,
Was figur'd by the discontent
Appearing in his looke.
At first, he could not silence breake,
(So heavy sorrow lay)
But when his sighs gave way to speake,
Thus, sadly did he say:

My onely Deare; and with that speech,
Not able to sustaine,
The floods of griefe at sorrowes breach,
He paus'd awhile againe.
At length (nigh fainting) did expresse,
These words, with much adoe;
Oh deare!  let not my loves excesse,
Me, and my love undo.

Shee, little mooved with his paine,
His much distraction eyde;
And changing love, into disdaine,
Thus (still unkind) replide:
Forbeare to urge one kindnesse more,
Unlesse you long to see,
The good respect you had before,
At once all lost in me.

With that, dismaid, his suit he ceast,
And, downe his head he hung:
And, as his Reasons strength decreast,
His passion grew more strong.
But, seeing shee did slight his mone
(With Willow Garlands wreath'd)
He sate him downe, and all alone,
This sad complaint he breath'd.

Oh Heavens!  Quoth he, Why doe we spend,
Endeavours thus in vaine;
Since what the Fates doe fore-intend,
They never change againe?
Nor Faith, nor Love, nor true Desert,
Nor all that man can doe,
Can winne him place within her heart,
That is not borne thereto.

Why doe I fondly waste my youth,
In secret sighs, and teares?
Why to preserve a spotlesse truth,
Taste I, so many cares?
For, women that no worth respect,
Doe so ungentle proove,
That some shall winne by their neglect,
What others lose with love.

Those, that have set the best at naught,
And no man could enjoy,
At last, by some base Gull are caught,
And gotten with a toy.
Yea, they that spend an ages light,
Their favours to obtaine;
For one unwilling over sight
May loose them all againe.

How glad, and faine, alas would I,
For her have underwent,
The greatest care, ere she should trie,
The smallest discontent?
Yet she, that may my life commaund,
And doth those passions know,
Denieth me a poore demaund,
In height of all my woe.

Oh, if the Noblest of her time,
And best belov'd of me;
Could for so poore, so slight a crime,
So voyd of pittie be,
Sure, had it beene some common one
Whose patience I had tride;
No wonder I had been undone,
Or unforgiven di'de.

A thousand lives I would have layd,
So well I once beleev'd,
She would have dain'd to lend me ayd,
If she had seene me greev'd.
But now, I live to see the day,
Where I presumed so;
I neither dare for pittie pray,
Nor tell her of my woe.

Yet, let not poore despised heart,
Her worth ought question'd be
Hadst thou not fayled in desert,
Shee had not failed thee.
But lest, perhaps, they flout thy mone,
That should esteem thee deare,
Goe, make it by thy selfe alone,
Where none may come to heare.

Still keepe thy forhead crown'd with smiles,
What passion ere thou trie;
That none may laugh at thee the whiles,
Thou discontented lye.
And let no wrong, by chance distaine
A love so truely faire:
But rather, never hope againe,
And thou shalt ne're despaire.

2.
O'ertyr'd by cruell passions that oppress me,
With heart nigh broken, Time no hope would give me,
Upon my bed I laid me downe to rest me;
And gentle sleepe, I wooed to relieve me.
But oh alas!  I found that on the morrow
My sleeping Joyes, brought forth my waking Sorrow.

For loe, a dreame I had so full of pleasure,
That to possesse, what to imbrace I seemed
Could not affect my Joy in higher measure,
Then now it greeves mee, that I have but dreamed.
Oh let my dreames be sighs and teares hereafter:
So, I that sleeping weepe, may wake in laughter.

Faine would I tell, how much that shaddow pleased me;
But tongue and pen, want words, and art in telling.
Yet this Ile say, to shew what horrour seazed me;
(When I was rob'd of blisse, so much excelling)
Might all my dreames be such; oh let me never
Awake againe:  but sleep and dreame for ever.

For, when I waking saw my selfe deceived,
And what an inward Hell it had procured,
To finde my selfe of all my hopes bereaved,
It brought on passions not to be endured:
And, knew I; next night had such dreames in keeping,
I'de make my eyes, forsweare, for ever sleeping.

3.
You wooddy Hils, you Dales, you Groves,
You Floods, and every Spring,
You Creatures, come, whom nothing moves,
And hear a Shepheard sing.
For to Heroes, Nymphes, and Swaines,
I long have made my mone:
Yet, what my mournfull verse containes,
Is understood of none.

In Song, APOLLO gave me skill;
Their love, his Sisters daine.
With those, that haunt Pernassus hill,
I friendship entertaine.
Yet, this is all in vaine to me,
So haplessely I fare,
As those things which my glory be,
My cause of ruine, are.

For, Love hath kindled in my brest,
His never quenched fire:
And I, who often have exprest,
What other men desire,
(Because I could so dive into,
The depth of others mone,
Now I my owne affliction show,
I heeded am, of none.

Oft have the Nymphs of greatest worth,
Made sute my Songs to heare.
As oft (when I have sighed forth,
Such notes as saddest were)
Alas!  said they, poore gentle heart,
Who ere that Shepheard be:
But, none of them suspects my smart,
Nor thinkes, it meaneth me.

When I have reacht so high a straine,
Of passion in my Song;
That they have seene the teares to raine
And trill my cheeke along:
Instead of sigh, or weeping eye,
To sympathize with me;
Oh, were he once in love, they crie,
How moving would he be?

Oh, pitie me, you Powers above,
And take my skill away:
Or let my hearers thinke I love,
And faine not what I say.
For, if I could disclose the smart,
Which I unknowne doe beare,
Each line would make them sighs impart,
And every word, a teare.

Had I a Mistresse, some doe thinke,
Shee should revealed be;
And I would favours weare, or drinke
Her health upon my Knee.
Alas poore fools!  they ayme awry,
Their fancy flags too low:
Could they my loves rare course espie,
They would amazed grow.

But, let nor Nymph nor Swaine conceive,
My tongue shall ever tell,
Who of this rest, doth mee bereave,
Or where I am not well.
But, if you sighing me espie,
Where rarest features be;
Marke, where I fixe a weeping eye,
And sweare you, There is shee.

Yet, ere my eyes betray me shall,
Ile swell, and burst with paine:
And, for each drop they would let fall,
My heart shall bleed me twaine.
For, since my soule more sorrow beares,
Then common lovers know;
I scorne, my passions should like theirs,
A common humour show.

Eare, never heard of, heretofore,
Of any Love like mine.
Nor shall there be for evermore,
Affection so divine.
And, that to faine it, none may try,
When I dissolv'd must be;
The first I am, it lived by,
And die it shall, with me.
