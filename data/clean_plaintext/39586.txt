Look on that flower &mdash; the daughter of the vale,
The Medicean statue of the shade!
Her limbs of modest beauty, aspect pale,
Are but by her ambrosial breath betray'd.
Those half in elegant relief display'd,
She standeth to our gaze, half-shrinking shuns&mdash;
Folding her green scarf, like a bashful maid,
Around to screen her from her suitor suns;
Not all her many sweets she lavisheth at once.

Locked in the twilight of depending boughs,
Where night and day commingled, she doth shoot
Where nightingales repeat their marriage vows:
First by retiring, wins our curious foot,
Then charms us by her loveliness to suit
Our contemplation to her lonely lot;
Her gloom, leaf, blossom, fragrance, form, dispute
Which shall attract most belgards to the spot&mdash;
And loveliest her array who fain would be forgot.

Her gloom, the aisle of heavenly solitude,
Her flower, the vestal Nun who there abideth;
Her breath, that of celestials, meekly woo'd
From heaven; her leaf, the holy veil which hideth
Her form, with purity resideth.
Spring's darling!  Nature's pride the Sylvan Queen!
To her, at eve, enamoured Zephyr glideth!
Trembling, she bids him waft aside her screen,
And to his kisses wakes &mdash; the Flora of the scene.
