EXTRACT.
Syr Johne, a Knyghte, who hath a barne of Lore,
Kenns Latyne at fyrste syghte from Frenche or Greke,
Tortures his Knowledge for ten Years or more,
To rynge upon the Latyne Worde to speke:
Whoever speke the Englysch is despised,
The Englysch hym to please, must fyrst be Latynyzed.

PARODY.
Caelya a Nymphe of mickle Witte, and Faire:
Kenns Fashyonne at fyrste syghte; from France ne doubt;
Nice to a poynte; the placynge of a Hair;
And never failynge every public Route:
What pity she to Anglo is ally'd!
The Englysch her to please, must fyrste be Frencheifyed.
