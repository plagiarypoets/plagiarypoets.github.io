Come forth, fair waters, from the classic spring,
And let me quaff your nectar, that my soul
May lift itself upon a bolder wing,
And spurn awhile this being's base control.&mdash;
How many a cup of inspiration stole
The bards from out thy sparkling well, and sung
Strains high, and worthy of the kindling bowl,
'Till all Aonia and Hesperia rung&mdash;
And on the green isles of the ocean sprung
A wilder race of minstrels, like the storm,
Which beats their rocky bulwarks; there thy strung
A louder harp, and show'd a prouder form;
And sending o'er the sea their song, our shore
Shall catch the sound, and silent sleep no more.
