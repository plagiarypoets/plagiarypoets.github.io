Perchance this auburn lock did erst adorn
The frizzled head of dwarf, or meagre beau;
And this, perchance, from poney's tail was shorn,
Or e'er the sheerman did a curl bestow,
Tho' since by virgins deem'd ne trifling show.
Ah fools!  to let false beauty charm the eyes,
When Nature Beauty gave in vernal glow
And with mild Goodness bade it ever rise,
Tho' more the coxcombs gaze the most of maidens prize.
