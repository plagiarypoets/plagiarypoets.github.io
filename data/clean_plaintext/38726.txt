Dull is the Scene of antient Feats of Wit,
Where mimic Mirth its Gambols played around;
And dull the Place where many a vacant Cit
An Hour's Relief from Care and Business found.

Flockton no more shall dance his Puppet Ring,
The swagg'ring Giant fill the Room no more,
No more the Monkey on the Rope shall swing,
Nor grin portentous at the Alehouse Door.

The Round-about its Wheel no more shall ply,
(Sure Emblem of the giddy Round of Life)
Nor Andrew's Self his merry Tricks shall try,
To raise amid the Croud the curious Strife.

Old Momus' Sons, and Thespis' merry Boys
In joint Exclusion curse their wayward Doom;
"Genius, they cry, must yield to gilded Toys,
And Wit to Plumbs and Apples must give Room!"

And now, so City Magistrates ordain,
In Oysters may we spend our sober Pence,
Or eat the Sausage on th' extended Plains:&mdash;
Alas!  that City Magistrates have Sense!
