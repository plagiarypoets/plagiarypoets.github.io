Beyond the Confines of the Western Moors,
Where lingring Fogs obscure the sickly Shores,
Stands a dull Grove; no subtle Beams of Light
Pierce the dull Darkness of th' impervious Night;
A Den beneath, which rugged Rocks surround,
Yawns thro' a Hill within the cavern'd Ground;
Here lazy Nature Sleep's Asylum chose,
And fix'd th' eternal Mansions of Repose.
Sloth and Oblivion, idle Sisters, wait
Before the Entrance of the sacred Gate,
Silence far off repells th' intruding Breeze,
And stills the chatt'ring Birds and rustling Trees.
Not all the roarings of the boiling Deep
Or Thunder's Rage disturb the peaceful Sleep.
A Stream along the Cavern's rocky Sides
Without one gurgling Murmur smoothly glides;
Round lie the sable Herds, and all around
A blighting Vapour, steaming from the Ground,
Wide o'er the Cave its drowzy Influence pours,
Withers the infant Herb, and blasts the rising Flow'rs.
Within the dewy Grot a Couch was spread,
Where free from Care the God supine was laid,
And drooping Poppies faded round his Head;
Beneath his lazy Limbs the Carpets sweat,
Slow from his Mouth exhales a sultry Heat,
His Hair dishevell'd by this Hand is born,
While that droops down unmindful of the Horn.
A Train of Dreams, Night's black Attendants, wait
Hang on the Walls, or flutter round the Gate,
These the gay Shape of flatt'ring Pleasures wear,
And those the sullen Visage of Despair,
Some true, some false in various Forms appear.
A Lamp, scarce breaking thro' the genuine Gloom,
Scatters a dubious Glimmering round the Room,
Trembling a while the feeble Taper glows,
Then sinks expiring, and invites Repose.
