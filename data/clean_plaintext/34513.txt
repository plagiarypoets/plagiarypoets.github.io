TO THE M. H. THE * * *
Lady, whose fair approof I wish should give
A glorious sanction to whate'er I write;
Since what your well-pois'd judgment marks with white
Secure from envy will to ages live;
So may I in this arduous emprise thrive,
As I not follow in the chase for spite;
But led by Love of True, and Fit, and Right,
In which good cause each gentle breast should strive:
While I with hazard of my own good name
Like Calidore pursue the Blatant Beast
In dear defense of Ladies' honest fame,
Which his foul mouth profanely taints with blame;
Let me howe'er, with dread and dangers press'd,
Enjoy the smiles of ev'ry virtuous dame.

TO THE R. H. THE * *  * *
Let him rail on, till e'vry mouth cry shame;
Of his ill word I little reckoning make
For Ladies' honor, and for Shakespear's sake;
So these I may defend from blot or blame:
But ill I bear, that any worthy name
Of those, who virtue for their mistress take,
And hate the sland'rer like the poisonous snake;
Should deem my just reproof deserving blame.
Yet, if fair * * speak in my defense,
If * vouchsafe her sanction to my page,
If * * sweetly deign to smile applause;
Aided by these and conscious innocence,
I'll boldly brave the CRITIC'S utmost rage;
And glory suff'ring in so just a cause.

TO MISS * *
Sweet Modesty, the third of that fair band,
Whom virtuous friendship, ill by churls deny'd
To Ladies' gentle bosoms, hath ally'd;
May I unblam'd your favoring voice deman,
While arm'd with Truth's good Shield alone I stand
In Shakespear's cause determin'd to abide
Th' outrageous efforts of insulting pride,
And marks of Calumny's detested brand?
Deep are the wounds she gives, and hard to heal.
Yet though enrag'd her hundred tongues she join
With canker'd spite to blast my honest name,
I reck not much, nor bate my pious zeal;
But to the Fair and Good my cause resign,
Who smile on Virtue, and whose smiles are Fame.
