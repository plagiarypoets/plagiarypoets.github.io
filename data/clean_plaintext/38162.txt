On you, my Lord, shall every Muse attend,
The Muses Patron and their noblest Friend:
In early Days Great Sidney Spenser crown'd,
Sidney the fam'd for Arts and Arms renown'd;
And next Southampton did our Shakespeare raise,
From mean obscurity to height of Praise;
The famous Buckingham to Cowley prov'd
A noble Patron, and his Genius mov'd;
Then sprung up Addison by Somers' Name,
Sacred to Wit, to Honour, and to Fame;
By Dorset, Hallifax and Prior great,
Rose to adorn the Business of the State;
But under Grafton's Wing shall every Bard,
Be Chear'd, and Countenanc'd, meet just reward,
By his great Influence the tuneful Nine,
(If I can right foretel by promis'd Sign)
Shall raise their drooping Heads, in splendor shine:
Gallia no longer of her Arts shall boast,
Arts which will ne'er be in Britannia lost,
Since Grafton from Hibernia's Rule comes o'er,
To cherish every Art on Britain's Shore:
Thro' his Protection shall each Science rise,
Each tow'ring Genius touch the vaulted Skies;
By Grafton nourish'd shall best Poets write,
And reach a Milton's or a Spenser's Flight:
From such Promotions such Excitements spring,
Once more the World may hear a Mantuan sing.

Thus in Great Dorset's Time was Wit restor'd,
And all Parnassus own'd its rightful Lord,
The long neglected Muse then rose, aspir'd,
And Fame immortal from his Rays acquir'd.

Now all ye Poets hail the joyful Day!
Illustrious Grafton o'er Wit's Cause bears sway;
Ye Arts and Sciences for Joy prepare,
And merit ever his peculiar Care;
He's the Mecaenas, Sidney, Dorset, All,
Whom glorious Patrons we can justly call;
He soars aloft amidst the titled Crowd,
He's Great, he's Noble, Generous, and Good:
Were all Preferments fill'd like his, to come,
Then shou'd we equal Athens and old Rome.
