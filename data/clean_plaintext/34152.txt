Black was the sky, when Thyrsis hy'd from town,
His drooping head press'd with a cypress crown;
His eyes distracted, chearless was his face,
And on he hasten'd, but with heavy pace:
But ere he to his sod-built cot had press'd,
Palemon met him, whom he thus address'd.

THYRSIS.
Stay, shepherd, stay, and hear a tale of woe!&mdash;
What rustic did not gay Hilaria know?&mdash;
But she's no more! &mdash; Go, feed thy simple flock,
And browze thy kids  on yonder shrubby rock:
Nor seek the plain; form thence all joy is fled:
Mourn, shepherd, mourn; for gay Hilaria's dead.

PALEMON.
Ah me, Hilaria!  whither art thou gone,
And left us o'er our hapless fate to moan!
No pleasure now in snowy lambs we view,
Nor can we aught but dreary grief pursue:
No mirthful dance will crown thy flow'ry mead,
For sports are tasteless, since Hilaria's dead.

THYRSIS.
Unmatch'd Hilaria!  in whose artless grace
Sat rural innocence, and each mild grace;
Marks of a pure, and nobly generous mind,
Where ev'ry honest, faithful virtue shin'd:
With praise, and vary'd flow'rs, her tombstone spread;
And, all ye shepherds, mourn Hilaria dead.

PALEMON.
Blythsome, and modest too; gay, yet discreet;
Her manners gentle; person always neat:
Like Pales, she our arbitress might seem,
When, at our junkets, she was held supreme.
Over her grave, let's choicest garlands shed,
While shepherds, 'round it, mourn Hilaria dead.

THYRSIS.
Heart breaking sight!  see where the solemn bier,
With all its pale attendants, now draws near!
Let's haste t' inform each nymph, and courteous swain,
Odours to strew, or raise a doleful strain:
And o'er the bier, let this short verse be said,
"Fortune, and life, are vain; Hilaria's dead!"

PALEMON.
Would I like letter'd Spencer could complain,
Or tune my voice in Milton's swelling vein;
Fluent as Addison, with Waller's ease,
And Philips' genius, ever form'd to please:
I'd teach the woods, and ev'ry lovely shade,
To sound, pathetic, Sweet Hilaria's dead.
