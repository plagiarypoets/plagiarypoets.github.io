O!  much esteem'd Unknown!  and didst thou deign
T' accept the simple off'ring of my lyre?
And breathe again such pure and hallow'd strain,
As but the Muse and virtue could inspire?
O how shall I, thus lowly, dare aspire,
AGNES, to court thy gentle ear once more!
Unless some portion of thy genius fire
My humbled muse; then to the Southern shore
The charmed breeze the off'ring might convey,&mdash;
Nor Ora blush to weave such far inferior lay.

Say, dost thou wander through some fragrant grove?
Or list the murmur of some limpid stream,
As by its flow'ry, verdant banks you rove,
When the fair star of ev'ning sheds her beam&mdash;
And all around as soft and calm doth seem
As is, fair Minstrel, thy own virtuous mind,
Tuning thy lyre to some romantic theme,
Or moral truth, or sentiment refin'd,
Or dedicating thy harmonious lays
To friendship warm, and pure &mdash; or "too, too generous praise?"

From roaring storms my fancy wings her way
To meet on Southern shore the lovely Spring
To find the spot where AGNES loves to stray,&mdash;
And there to rest her weary shatter'd wing;
To listen to the sweetly warbling string
Of thy soft lyre, with all a sister's love;&mdash;
To blunt the point of Sorrow's poison'd sting;&mdash;
And talk together of the world above
'Tis vain! &mdash; the beauteous vision melts away,
As on the lake's still breast the last faint flush of day.
