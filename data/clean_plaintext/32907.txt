Too popular is Tragicke Poesie,
Strayning his tip-toes for a farthing fee,
And doth besides flow from carelesse head.
Some braver braine in high Heroick rimes
Compileth worm-eate stories of olde tymes:
And he like some imperious Maronist,
Conjures the Muses that they him assist.
Then strives he to bumbast his feeble lines
With farre-fetcht phrase:
And maketh up his hard-betaken tale,
With straunge enchantments, fetcht from darksom vale
Of some Melissa, that by Magicke doome
To Tuscans soyle transporteth Merlins toombe:
Painters and poets hold your auncient right:
Write what you wil, and write not what you might:
Their limits be their List, their reason will.
But if some painter in presuming skill
Should paint the stars in center of the earth,
Could ye forbeare some smiles, and taunting mirth.
But let no rebell Satyre dare traduce
Th' eternall Legends of thy Faery Muse,
Renowmed Spencer:  whom no earthly wight
Dares once to emulate, much lesse dares despight.
Salust of France, and Tuscan Ariost,
Yeeld up the Lawrell girlond ye have lost:
And let all others willow weare with mee,
Or let their undeserving Temples bared bee.
