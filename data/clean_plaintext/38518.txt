Ae Sunny morn' for recreation
Twa hats began a slow cantation,
They frae a skelf began to claver,
The tane was Woo' the tither Beaver;
Their notes through ilka corner rang,
While I sat mute to hear their sang.

BEAVER HAT.
Ah me!  to what will bus'ness turn?
A' day I here may sit an mourn,
Nane spiers my price, though I can boast
Of lately leaving England's coast;
Tho' Beaver, what doth that avail me?
My master sure's nae like to sell me,
Already on my head is laid,
Full five per cent, as loss on trade.

WOOL HAT.
I here wha sit am coarser gear
Than you, but coarser fou'k me wear.
This month I've dally'd on the skelf;
For credit or for ready pelf,
Nane think sae much as ance to spier
Gin I, poor I, be cheap or dear.

BEAVER HAT.
Sin' Scotia first a kingdom was
They've broke, they've made, an' mended laws;
Some for our well an' preservation,
Some, ane wou'd think, down-right d&mdash;n&mdash;n;
But ae unvaried rule in trade is,
By every trader down it laid is,
To grasp; in ilka scheme they'll pry,
Gin ane should fail, anither try.
Now that though trade in hats be sma',
There's ither trades for him to ca.

WOOL HAT.
True neighbour, but ye ken fu' well
That trade of late's gaen to the deil,
Shou'd ane suggest a trade, an' thrive in't,
Some wou'd back-bite, some under-sell,
Some wou'd play tricks I darna tell;
To wrest the trade frae the contriver,
Some wou'd sweep hell to find a stiver.
Your hand my chield, let us devise
Some cannie knack, by which he'll rise
A wee, for now a days I tak' it,
Poor fouk by a' are disrespectit,
But siller, strange infatuation,
Mak's fools caress'd in every nation:
He's young an' stout wi' fient a joint out,
Will ye some honest way but point out.

BEAVER HAT.
Troth Rockie, frae my heart I think
He's got the knack o' crambo clink;
By that there's aft been siller made,
An' here, that's sure nae common trade.
Curs'd opposition maun be born,
Let wha blaws best bear aff the horn.

WOOL HAT.
Wa wi' your stuff he has nae smeadum,
He publish!  saul I wou'd nae read him;
There's chields ca'd Critics (do his best on't)
Wou'd shake their craps, an' that fu' fest, on't.
And shou'd gross faults in it ly thick,
Him an' his book they'd send to Nick;
At least gin their ill tongues cou'd do it.
To publish, then, I fear he'd rue it;
Presumption, sure 'twould be the height o't,
Good lack!  they'd laugh just at the sight o't.

His education's been sae sma',
He hardly kens a B frae A;
I own that's nae his wyte, for why?
Oer soon he try'd to rear a pye;
Gin ten year-auld as sure as lent is,
He was a Baker's bound apprentice;
An' ay till now his toil's been hard,
How cou'd he think to turn a Bard!

BEAVER HAT.
Wae on your snout!  you speak o' smeadum,
Coarse are your thoughts, as coarse you've made 'em;
Wou'd you speak sense, it sure wou'd glad ane;
They're born Poets, lear' ne'er made ane.

A Bard tho' barefoot rough an' ruddie,
Wi' mither wit, tho' foul an' duddie,
Can paint fu' well the ways o' nature,
Her every grace, an' every feature.

He'd tell the thoughts o' lower classes,
As credulous house-wives, lads an' lasses;
Wha, round the ingle wi' their rocks,
Convene, to crack their jeery jocks.

When Rob wi' twa right pawkie een,
A wyllie wager lays wi' Jean,
"That he'll wi' ease a rigg length rin,
E'er she her hindmost teat will spin;"
The temper pin she gi'es a tirl,
An' spins but slow, yet seems to birl;
Thinking to blind her neighbour Bess,
That Rob may rin an' win the kiss.

Or tell the pranks o' winter nights;
How Satan blazes uncouth lights,
Or how he does a core convene,
Upon a witch-frequented green;

Wi' spells an' cauntrips hellish rantin',
Like maukins thro' the fields they're jauntin'.
How some are sent kirk-yards to haunt;
To ape the deil, the others maunt;
When tir'd o' that fell midnight-dance,
Some in egg shells leg aff for France.

The rest round Satan, frisk and gambol,
Or, in fell shapes, 'bout peat stacks ramble;
Till douf the twall-hours bell crys clink,
Than aff a' wallop in a wink.

The deil to shades below retires,
The wives leg hame an' trim their fires.
An' sic like tales in clinking verse,
A barefoot Bard cou'd well rehearse.

'Cause he's nae skill'd in classic lorum,
For that, I'd sure the mair adore him;
Nor will a Critic wreck his sense on
A youth, wha has sae sma' pretension.

WOOL HAT.
Hech man I find I e'en maun yield,
You've reason'd well; an' won the field;
Sure there's nae Critics when they ken him,
Will suffer rattle-sculls to blame him,
He's sic a chield I'd like to please him,
May a rin hyte that mean to tease him.

I listn'd lang, they said nae mair,
But their confab sae eas'd my care,
That up I got, an' pray'd Apollo
To time it, either jig or solo.&mdash;

He shook his head in indignation;
"I'm quite asham'd; this generation
Wou'd a' be Poets, Dabs, and Fiddlers,
Vain empty mortals, crazy middlers,
That ken nae mair my valu'd arts,
Their nicest touches, soothing parts,
Than does an oyster wench or cronnie,
To personate a Macaroni.
There's ane ca'd Burns, a Bard at Air,
Got a the fire I weel cou'd spare;
Sae curb a wee your rhyming rage,
For he'll reign Laureat of this age."

My face had got a scarlet dip,
Right fly'd was I, an' hang my lip;
But yet ance mair I beg'd his aid;
He gae a fidge and naithing said,
I urg'd my cause wi' seeming zeal,
An' bad him mind my Beaver's tale.

All, said I, are not Shakespeares born,
An' yet your badge have hunders worn;
Try me this ance, an' gin I fail
To tell wi' glee my hame spung tale,
I'll burn my pen, an' spill my ink,
An' spurn through life at crambo clink.

He look'd, he smil'd, an' sae did I,
"Sin' you're sae fond (said he) gae try;
An' shou'd Parnassus brae be steep,
Get on all four an' slowly creep;
He that wo'd speel the braes o' rhyme,
Maun stamp in tune, an' count the time;
Due perseverance an' my aid,
May mak' a deacon at the trade;
Puff, I inspire you wi' this blast,
The first pursue you've got the last."

I try'd my skill, sae reader judge,
But first thro' every column trudge;
Candour frae prejudice defend them,
Let nane contemn, but wha can mend them.

Says an eminent Author.
"'Tis with our judgment as our watches, none
Go just alike, yet each believes his own."

But of a great many it may be rendered thus.
"But first what say the critics, or the crowd,
With them I'll join to curse, or praise aloud."
