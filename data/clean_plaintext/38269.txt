Whylome I thumb'd a Greke Romaunt,
Ryghte Sounde in Sense, in Style plaisant;
Penn'd by the Rawleigh of his Age,
A Soldiere, and a parlous Sage:
In whych I found a Tale, pardie,
Sir Knyght!  wold suit you and me.
In auntient Rymes I wyll arede
Thilk auntient Tale; shold I excede,
Do neet myne Simpless over-crow;
Deficiences mai shend us mo.

When Cyrus rul'd in Eastern Relme,
A Statist wriggled to the Helme
Pheraulas hight; for golden Fee,
A mar'lous itching Palm had he!
Wele-born, I trow, weren his Cozens,
Guerdons he gave to eche by Dozens.
Lordes suck'd lich Country-Ladies Pages,
And kyss'd his Colon for Borde Wages.
The m&mdash; Priests (who cleps hem Fools?)
For Altars bow'd to his Close-Stools.
Pyllage and Brybes did so be-gold him,
Hys Housen were too crycup to hold him:
A Palace he mote have!  He built one
Fine as the Divel's Dome in Milton:
Sainct Jago's wyth it's pysse-brent Walle
Neet mo cou'd mate it than Tart-Hall.
Nathless Pheraulas found no Chink,
Where he mought slopen sause one Wink:
He dempt a brond-iron (mortal keene!)
Threten'd hys Cragg!  Certes, I ween,
The herte-worm yerk'd hym.  Maistre Moor!
Then had thyne Poudre work'd a Cure.
That Cure were mochel bett to brag on
Than had thou quell'd the Wantly Dragon.
There was a Court-Bug of his Clan,
Schap'd lich a Rundler, neet a Man;
In Chinese Vis'nomy and Figure
Sembling Le H*** but somdele bygger,
Sacas bynempt:  Thilk ribauld Wight
Found Sir Pheraulas in sad Plight:
Gold, Gold, (he shright) murders myne Slepe;
Yf soote to gayne, 'tis soure to kepe!
That bin, in sooth, a queint Opinion,
Aunswer'd the miscreated Minion:
Sithence you herie neet Gode's Foison,
You chaunge Gold-Cordial into Poison.
Wyth twice tway Milliones in your Chest,
Ti's eith to buy a Plowman's Rest.&mdash;
The Fiend, the Fiend, &mdash; (wele may you sterte)
Hammers hote Hob-Nayles on myne Herte!
Cou'd you peep thro' thilk Silver Patch,
You wold neet merveil that I watch!
Soothly, quo' Sacas Welth I wys,
Whylome was your supremest Blyss:
But, paravault, you now maie drede
Ryghte of Resumptioun wyll succeede.
Ah!  cou'd myne Friend the Brief indure;
I mought, perdie, your Blyss recure:
Videlicet, yeve me your Londes,
Your Gold, Gemms, Owches, Bills and Bondes,
Your Gardens eke, and gorgeous House.&mdash;
Yea, Saky; &mdash; Wyth them take myne Spouse.
I venture for sike unbless'd Gaynes
Both myne Nyght-Bonnet, and myne Braines;
But to be juste, and als discrete,
Eche Morn I'le yeve you &mdash; what be mete:
Blythe as a Robin then youle rise,
Fro for Paines and Penalties&mdash;
Now may the Divel truss myne Wyf,
Pheraulas cry'd, yf in myne Lyf,
Iv'e kenn'd a Scheme mo a propos!
Saky, take all, &mdash; it shall be so.
Prieve it to thee Honie or galle,
Myne Ultimatum ys, Take Alle!

Let US thilk Tale to Use applye;
You, Sir, Pheraule; Dan Sacas, I&mdash;
