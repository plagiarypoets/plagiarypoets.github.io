I that ne're tasted the Castalian fount,
Or came in ken of the Thessalian Mount:
I that could ne'er attaine to wet my lips,
With Tempes liquour, or sweet Aganipps,
Who never yet have so much favour won,
To purchase one carrowse from Helicon,
Who with good Poets dare compare no way
But one, which is in being poore as they;
And having never seene the Muses hill,
Am plentifully stor'd with want of skill,
Then Fount, or Mount, nor sacred treble trine,
Are no assistances in this worke of mine:
But ancient Isis current chrystall spring
Inspires my braine, and I her praises sing,
And Tame with Isis joynes his pearely streames,
Whose combination are my ample theames;
Though (for the most part) in the tracts I tread,
Of learned Camden, Speed, and Hollinshed,
And Draytons painfull Polyolbyon,
Whose fame shall live, despite oblivion,
These are the guides I follow, with pretence
T' abbreviate and extract their Quint-essence;
Nor can it be to them disparagement,
That I come after in the way as they went,
For they of former writers so followers be,
I follow them, and some may follow me;
And man to man a President is made
In Art or Science, mysterie or Trade,
As they before these Rivers bounds did show,
Here I come after with my Pen and row.
