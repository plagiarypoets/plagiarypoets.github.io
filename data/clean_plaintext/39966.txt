If on the favour'd sons of earth,
Are such superior gifts bestow'd,
And man, the moment of his birth,
Basks in the suff'rage of his God;
If, as the transient moments roll,
That wakes to life his genial powers,
Whilst Reason's rays illume his soul,
And Health smiles on his early hours;
Let heav'n-born Gratitude his breast enflame,
To that superior Power, that plann'd the wond'rous frame.

'Tis He who bids the blooming Spring,
In all the pride of youth appear;
Her annual buds and blossoms bring,
That decorate the infant year;
'Tis He who bids mild Summer's reign,
With fost'ring warmth mature the soil;
Pourtrays the form of fruits and grain,
And animates the peasant's toil;
Nor does the night its welcome aid refuse,
But mitigates the heat with soft'ning dews.

Already has this whirling sphere
Near half her revolution made;
More gladd'ning prospects now appear,
And plenty revels in the shade;
The jocund youth with vacant mind,
Enjoys the sweets that temp'rance brings;
Beneath the hawthorn sits reclin'd,
And with unfeigned rapture sings;
Whilst o'er his head th' aspiring ash tree bends,
And the wide spreading oak its ample shade extends.

Now Summer's fervour rages round,
The sun darts fierce his burning rays;
The flocks now seek the covert ground,
And Nature pants beneath the blaze;
But when cool Ev'ning's moist'ning dews,
Full grateful on the plains descend;
Who can the pleasing walk refuse
To share the converse of a friend?
Where the rapt soul may genuine truths impart,
Nor dare to speak what's foreign to the heart.
