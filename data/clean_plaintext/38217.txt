Hail!  godlike Liberty, to thee
We raise the voice, we bend the knee;
To thy wide-structur'd dome
Shall ev'ry free born Briton come
(For all Britannia's sons are thine)
There shall each votary impart
The just resentment of a grateful heart,
And deck with ambient wreaths thy consecrated shrine.

The sons of treason and infernal night
Struck at the basis of our native right,
With plots by hell, and all its pow'rs, inspir'd,
But thy almighty force withstood
Oppression's strong, ungovernable flood,
And vanquish'd perfidy retir'd
Back to the zenith of her dark demain,
And lo!  the cherub peace resumes her blissful reign.

'Twas thy active genius fir'd
William, the rebels justest dread;
'Twas thy solemn voice inspir'd
The hardy troops, and bid them move
To dart the thunder of our British Jove,
And crush sedition's still-reviving head.
Then, then my country lay
Hush'd in a gen'ral pause,
Anxious, and trembling, for th' important day,
That, or for ever sunk, or sav'd her laws!

But wiser fates o'er-ruling doom
Defer'd awhile the mighty blow,
The grand event was yet to come,
And heav'n, to make it sure, had made it slow.
The foe, by William's single name subdu'd,
Ne'er meant to risk the dubious fight;
Still fast they fled, as punishment pursu'd,
Dismay'd, and conscious of superior might.
But should they turn again
And boldly face it on the plain,
In vain, alas!  they tempt th' unequal fray,
For GEORGE was born to rule, and they to still obey.

Hail then, goddess!  fair and free,
Hight by mortals Liberty,
Behold the poet brings his votive lay,
The richest gift the Muse can pay;
Behold thy sacred altars blaze,
Thy roofs resound with iterated praise!
Grant thou we ever may revere thy name,
The theme unvary'd, and the cause the same;
By blessing still this fav'rite shoar,
In ev'ry gen'rous Briton's breast,
Let still thy darling attribute stand forth confest,
And freedom guard these realms till time shall be no more.
