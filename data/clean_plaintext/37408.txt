I.
Now Sol but faintly lends his radiant beams,
Creation's better half in silence laid;
Old Time with solemn pace
Begins his wint'ry reign.

II.
See!  sable clouds in wild disorder rise,
Born on the wings of raging northern blasts,
That flood the trembling plain
And leafless trees lay waste:
Down the rough precipice in thunder roars&mdash;
A grandeur that exalts th' ennobled mind!

III.
A silver frost succeeds
Wildly magnificent!
The distant hills rear up their hoary head,
While pendent icicles like diamonds shine:
Thus clad in rich disguise,
Each object nature brightens.

IV.
In frosted marshes see the nodding reed,
Seem polish'd lances in a hostile field:
The myriad atoms fly,
If but a gust of wind;
While moping birds the rattling branches shun,
And in a spangled show'r the prospect ends.

V.
This was the fatal month,
Two lovers fell a prey,
As long as tears from gentle hearts shall flow
Pathetic, claims the tributary tear;
Begin Melpomene
The lamentable tale.

VI.
In the sequester'd windings of a vale
Near that fam'd city whose majestic domes
Celestial science rear'd:
Along whose flow'ry banks,
The beauteous Isis rolls her lucid stream,
Amid delightful rural scenes retir'd;
Where dwelt young grey-ey'd Peace,
With sweet serenity.

VII.
Here liv'd the gay Theana blooming maid,
And much lov'd Amurat, a matchless pair!
As rosy mornings break,
Each tint glow'd in her face,
Like orient dimpled smiles that flash from heav'n,
The softest blush that nature ever spread.

VIII.
Twice nine revolving years
Spread o'er Theana's form:
Indulgent nature pour'd her choicest gifts,
In person captivating as in mind;
Which please exalted sense,
Enchants th' impassion'd breast.

IX.
She veil'd her swelling bosom, wild with youth,
Beneath the foliage of the shading gauze,
Where blooming excellence
Display'd her skilful hand.

X.
No piteous object could she ever see,
But soft compassion shar'd the poignant woe;
While looks divinely mild,
Endear'd the hand that gave.
Each soft emotion of a faultless heart,
Expressive in her eyes all-lovely shone,
Which never, never knew
To feign, or to disguise.

XI.
Young Amurat the pride of all the swains,
From whose all-conquering eye, serenely mild,
Shown forth the feeling heart,
Unknown to fraud or guile.
From heighten'd friendship love's first link began,
In neither bosom lodg'd a sanguine wish
That virtue hidden  keeps,
But quickly was reveal'd.

XII.
What happy moments of pure innate bliss!
That bliss too exquisite, too long to last,
Where Fortune proves a foe
To sympathetic love.

XIII.
His father now with harsh and stern commands&mdash;
Unfeeling heart! &mdash; more hard than flinty stone,
Whence all his pelf in store;
Who love nor pity knew.
Long had he seen their free unspotted flame,
Then with a killing parent's frown at last
Forbad poor Amurat
To see his peerless maid.

XIV.
His gentle breast in agonizing throes,
The dire decree he durst not disobey,
The filial conflict tries&mdash;
Yet could not cease to love.

XV.
Deny'd Theana's sight, conceal'd he strove
To snatch a transient glance, to mark the spot
By spreading hawthorns hid,
Where oft she walk'd and wept.

XVI.
His soul in fault'ring accents hail'd the fair;
While fell despair that rends th' impassion'd breast,
By Cynthia's love-sick beam,
The midnight-mourner stray'd.

XVII.
Thou'rt all my fondest wish can form, he cry'd,
Thy Amurat thou lov'st with mutual flame;
Thy mind of heav'n partakes,
Stranger to every art.
But oh!  my perturbated heart beats high&mdash;
Come floods of briny tears to my relief;
For dear art thou grown
Thou loveliest of the sex.

XVIII.
In all the blooming pride of youthful charms,
Supremely form'd thy Amurat to bless;
Now from his chaste embrace,
O cruel art thou torn!

XIX.
Vain thought!  it must not be &mdash; Theana's lost;
And oh, my aching heart is doom'd to bleed&mdash;
The flatt'ring scene is o'er
My hopes for ever fled.

XX.
His youthful cheeks, where health with beauty flow'd,
Like budding roses ope their crimson'd tints;
Now o'er th' enraptur'd face
Disease and paleness reign.

XXI.
The unrelenting sire, stung with remorse,
Invokes offended heav'n with fruitless vows;
And fruitless sorrows moan,
Around his dying bed:
'Tis past!  'tis past!  he cry'd, &mdash; but if that breast
Can e'er be mov'd with mercy's softest plea,
Let me once more behold
What I must ever love.

XXII.
On wings of love Theana flying came;
The big swoln tears rush from their lovely spheres,
And bath'd the marble hand
Of heart-broke Amurat.
A deadly cold transfix'd his panting heart,&mdash;
Adieu &mdash; he fault'ring cry'd &mdash; and swooning fell&mdash;
Struck motionless she stands,
Drown'd in a sea of woe.

XXIII.
But O the cruel he whose ill-tim'd care
Forbad what lost Theana came to say;
"My much lov'd Amurat,
O live for wretched me."

XXIV.
Now homeward as the hopeless maiden wept,
The blasts blew cold; the night-owl scream'd
Her lover's funeral dirge:
Amid the gloom of eve,
Her tortur'd mind now startles at each shade;
And ev'ry sound she hears his piercing groans.

XXV.
Alone, thus as she past
The visionary vale&mdash;
When lo!  the death-bell smote her frantic ear&mdash;
Just as she reach'd with hasty trembling step
Her aged mother's door&mdash;
He's gone!  he's gone!  she cry'd,
And I shall see that angel face no more.&mdash;
I feel &mdash; I feel &mdash; my heart-strings break &mdash; my Am&mdash;
Then to the earth she sunk
And with an &mdash; oh! &mdash; expir'd.

EPITAPH.
Let the Muse for ever mourn
With elegance of woe;
While holy Friendship stands a mourner here,
And all their virtues dwell on Mem'ry's ear:
At their unspotted shrine
Soft Pity drops her tear.
In Death's soft slumbers lull'd two lovers rest
United now in visionary bliss,
That gently whispers peace:
Till that eternal day
By guardian angels, borne on golden wings,
They soaring fly to realms of lasting love.
