SCENE, THE BANKS OF THE OHIO.
TIME, MORNING.

Scarce had the morn her orient course begun,
Or early breeze fann'd the rising sun,
When Mingo on Ohio's margin stood,
And told his sorrows to the gliding flood:&mdash;

"With love of glory would the chiefs inflame
My breast; &mdash; and lead me to the field of fame:
In vain with glee, they shew their scalps and scars,
The glorious trophies of their forest wars,
On me their praises and reproofs are lost,
No flame but love &mdash; but scorching love I boast,
The nimble Lawrah does my breath inspire,
Wakes ev'ry sense, and sets me all on fire:
Enraptur'd while I view her yellow neck,
As soft as bear-grease, and as beaver sleek,
From her grey eyes the living lightnings rush,
Like the fresh dew-drops glitt'ring thro' a bush.
But vain my songs re-echo thro' the shade,
Nor vows, nor tears, can move the haughty maid.
Yet other nymphs with fruitless ardor burn,
And feel a passion I can ne'er return.
In vain, with gifts of fish, Agolla strove
To shake my constancy and win my love,
Her rough advances like a skunk I shun,
And from her face with eager footsteps run.
But vain, my songs re-echo thro' the grove,
Nor vows, nor tears, the haughty maid can move:
Then cease these fruitless plaints, I'll take my spear,
And thro' the forest chace the shaggy bear;
The bounding buck shall own my oft-try'd art,
And feel this arrow rankling in his heart."
