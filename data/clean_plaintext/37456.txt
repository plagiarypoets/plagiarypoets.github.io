O Reverend Sire!  hide not with bashful care
Thy aged form; nor Pride's fastidious frown,
Nor cold Aversion's start
Forbid thy meek approach.

Soft Sympathy beholds thy care-bent back,
Thy hoary hairs that thinly veil thy head,
Thy furrow'd front of woe,
With many a heart-felt sigh.

Ah, look not so! &mdash; Methinks thy alter'd face,
Smooth'd with a smile, my father's likeness wears,
Thus the dim spark of age
Illumes his feeble eye.

O eye, thou faithful picture of the soul!
When Time has robb'd the intellectual store,
Scarce one poor ray of thought
Breaks thro' the gather'd gloom.
