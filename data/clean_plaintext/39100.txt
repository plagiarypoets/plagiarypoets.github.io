To hardship, friend, enure thy son betimes;
Send the stout youth with level'd spear to ride
At the fierce Parthian foe,
And in sharp warfare learn
To joust with danger, snatch his sleeps abroad,
And bear the narrow dole of penury.
Him from the hostile wall
With anxious measuring eye
The royal mother, or the bride, shall view,
Trembling, least he whom their rash wishes shield,
When gore-fed anger calls
To rend the reeking ranks,
Meet the young lion &mdash; tempt the doubtful strife.
'Tis sweet and seemly for our land to fall.
The flying footstep Death
Also attains, nor spares
The coward's hamstring, or his branded back.
True Fortitude not only braves the fight
Undaunted, but the camp;
Nor heeds a clamorous crew
At punishment and pardon rash alike.
To those who merit not the stroke of fate
She reachers to unbar
The portals of the sky
Pointing no common path:  on soaring wing
She flies the low-lived feast and wine-sprent floor.
Nor unrewarded goes
Fidelity's dumb tongue:
Hence who the Eleusinian pomp reveals!
With him beneath the over-hanging roof
I walk not, or abide
With him the treacherous keel:
Least haply in the dome of evil men
A frowning godhead their companions join:
Vengeance, tho' lame of foot,
Is sure to overtake.
But the just man secure his course pursues;
Not the fond croud's impetuous zeal for ill,
No tyrant's marking frown,
His rooted purpose shakes.
Him would the storm-vext Adriatic surge,
The smould'ring lightning hurl'd by Jove's high hand,
The wreck of shattering worlds,
Unfearing smite.
Thus, Pollux, thus the rover Hercules
Strove to attain the beamy seats above,
Where in the nectar'd bowl
They tinge the rosier lip:
Thus, tiger-curbing Bacchus, couldst thou climb
The home of Gods &mdash; Quintus thus ascend
Borne on the steed of Mars
Beyond the flood of earth.
