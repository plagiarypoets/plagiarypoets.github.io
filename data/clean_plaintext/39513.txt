My days of delight are no more,
Sweet moments of pleasure and peace;
The smile of the Morning is o'er,
And Night bids his horror increase.

The landscape, which smil'd to the view,
When Innocence gladden'd the day;
The flowrets which glitter'd with dew,
Alas!  are alike pass'd away.

'Twas Delia which made them look bright,
Her presence enlighten'd the scene;
Her absence had hid them in night,
For she of the plain was the Queen.

Yet ah!  how severe to my mind,
My folly has banish'd the Fair;
To her merit and worthiness blind,
I rightly am doom'd to despair.

Yet gentle's her bosom, I know,
How lovely and sweet to behold!
Tho' white as the fleece-fallen snow,
'Twas never, no, never, so cold.

Ye nymphs, and ye shepherds, come join,
With me the dear charmer implore,
Ah!  let her again but be kind,
And I shall be happy once more.
