Now on the Chambermaid's astonish'd ear
Th' awakening clock with solemn, awful sound,
Strikes nine!  Up springs the bonny lass, nor heeds
The fond regrets, the soft seducing voice,
Of JOHN, the Footman, her enamour'd swain,
But straight with nimble hand and sturdy broom
Repairs the havock caus'd by rout or drum.
Now, does the SWEEP, with sootbag at his back,
Patrole with limping pace the vacant street,
And, like the cricket, utter their shrill cry:
Now, too, the MILKMAID, with her well-fill'd pails,
Marks on the door, numerically true,
The chalky score, and ne'er marks two for one:
Now, from the purlieus of Queen Anne-Street East
The heedless Youth steals forth, with hair dishevel'd,
No glossy black adorns his boots or shoes,
His neckcloth pines to meet the Washer's grasp,
And thus the sloven, with disordered pace,
Or in the shelter of some friendly hack,
Arrives at home to meet the lecture dire:
Now do the sturdy DUSTMEN beat their rounds,
And at the summons of their oft toll'd bell
[Line illegible]
A lucky hit produce a silver spoon,
Straight to the Pawnbroker's they eager hie,
Receive the loan and quaff large draughts of purl:
Now do the Hackney-coachmen watchful ply&mdash;
Now does the BACHANALIAN quit his glass&mdash;
Now does the spruce APPRENTICE ope his shop&mdash;
And now the SHOEBLACK stirs his jetty bowl.
Therefore, Oh MUSE, leave off descriptive strains,
And taste with me the joys of rural plains.
