What beauteous form fair Lady do I see,
With graces shining in pellucid light,
Which sparkle bright in fancy's gazing ee,
And erst with glare o'erwhelm the wearied sight;
While as I near approach the vision bright,
Thy angel form discloses to my view,
Beyond the semblance of that lovely spright,
In charms transcendent and for ever new,
Transmitting heav'nly rays from their etherial hue.

The more divinely beautiful thou art,
Lady of beauty's treachery beware,
Watch with unceasing vigilance thy heart,
And guard thy charms ev'n with an angel's care,
From lightest breathings of unhallowed air
Flatt'rys foul breath opposed to guileless praise,
Will the pure light of innocence impair,
When upon thee the eye presumes to gaze,
Where loveliness and grace do ravish it always.

Yet all how frail but virtues of the soul!
Unchanging these, beyond the reach of time,
While the full tides of ages onward roll,
Their beauty keep in undecaying prime,
And still perfecting in that genial clime,
Where heavenly spirits dwell and saints of light,
And kings and priests and mighty seraphim;
Appalling guilt with radiance flashing bright,
Who holy are and terrible to mortal sight.

Lady, forgive this feeble lay from one,
Who feels the sovereign force of virtue's power,
In her whose sunlike path is but begun,
To shine yet more unto the perfect hour.
With me, alas!  on whom the skies do lour,
With angry frown &mdash; as most unworthy thee;
There scarce remains a solitary flower,
Of joy, or hope, within my breast to be&mdash;
For ruthless is the storm that turns its rage on me.
