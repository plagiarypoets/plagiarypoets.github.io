I saw a weary way-worn man &mdash; whose form
Was bent and bow'd with toil and crook'd with age;
Like an old oak he stood &mdash; on which the storm
Of many a year had bent its fiercest rage;&mdash;
Nor still unscath'd stood he &mdash; his pilgrimage
Was long &mdash; and slowly tottering on he came,
Alone and desolate! . . . The world's wide stage
Had nought of pleasure left for him, and fame
Told not his warlike deeds nor did his works proclaim.

Friendless was he &mdash; unpitied and unknown&mdash;
Fall all his race and kindred long were dead;&mdash;
And he was left forsaken and alone,
To beg a shelter for his houseless head!
Yes!  he who in his country's cause had bled
And nerv'd his arm for right and Liberty&mdash;
He &mdash; now went houseless &mdash; all his joys were fled&mdash;
Poor, comfortless, despised &mdash; in misery&mdash;
Without one breast, for all his wretchedness to sigh.

He paused awhile &mdash; and with an uprais'd glance
He gazed intent on every form that pass'd,
The young &mdash; the middle aged &mdash; the old &mdash; that chance
Had hap'd to bring that way: &mdash; and each one cast
A cold unfriendly look at him &mdash; then fast
Retreating, left him standing lonely there.
This was too much! &mdash; he'd borne the wintry blast,
The midnight storm &mdash; without a sigh or tear&mdash;
But, O, such cold indifference he could not bear.

I saw the tear steal from his aged eye&mdash;
I saw him dash it hastily aside&mdash;
He bore his many suffering manfully,
And scorn'd to murmur in his veteran pride.
The old man went his way &mdash; nor friend nor guide
Led him through regions all unknown. &mdash; His way
Was dark &mdash; his wants by none supplied&mdash;
Nor murmur'd he, tho' not one single ray
Broke the deep gloom through which he pass'd to brighter day.

I turn'd away in sorrow, "And is this,"
I cried, "the hardy veteran's only meed?
Must he who pav'd the way to our own bliss,
Be thus condemn'd to penury and need?"
No!  Heaven forbids!  by mercy 'tis decreed
That some extended arm, tho' late should save
From misery, want, and wo &mdash; those men who freed
Their soil and country from perdition's wave,
Nor suffer them to sink forgotten to the grave.
