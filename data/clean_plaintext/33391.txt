I will not venture to usurpe or claime
The sacred Title of a Poets name,
Or dare to challenge ought that doth belong
Unto their merits, least their worths I wrong.
The Worlds applausive praise I will resigne
To Phoebus sonnes, their Raptures are Divine,
Sublime transcendent; and their Candor's such
That I can but the superficies touch
Of their perfections:  no, I have no skill
To sound their praises, or to guide my quill:
To portraict forth th' Idea of their Fame,
Unlesse by writing of a Poets name;
Yet that's enough; for sweete-ton'd Poesie
Makes men immortall, and doth Deifie
Them by their actions:  what was ever writ
By a true Poet, Fame eterniz'd it;
Witness an Homer, or brave Horace name,
Propertius, Virgil, or sweete Ovids fame;
Or looke but backe to these our Moderne times,
Spencer, though dead, surviveth by his rimes;
Johnson, and others needlesse to rehearse,
Are eternized by their famous Verse;
Unto those worths, Time-during Fame hath rais'd
Trophies of Honour, to their lasting praise.
Oh that I could but shew, or else expresse
Of great Apollo's darlings, who surpasse
So farre the Vulgar, as bright Diamonds glasse!
My Lines are framed in a Leaden mould,
Their Strains composed of the purest gold;
Whose high-tun'd words, like precious Jems adorne
The Readers eare, too costly to be worne
By every Vulgar Criticke, who despight
All sence of reason, be it wrong or right,
Will spit the venome of their malice, and
Censure mens Labours, though not understand:
But's to no purpose; say they what they will,
Poets are Poets, they but Coxecombes still.
