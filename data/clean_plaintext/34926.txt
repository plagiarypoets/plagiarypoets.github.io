Parent of light and song, whatever name,
Phoebus, or Mithras, more delight thine ear;
The Muse, with rapture, hails thy rising beams,
Burst from her drear confinement, where the hand
Of vaunting tyranny represt her rage,
And damp'd her flagging wing, now borne aloft
To milder regions, and more genial soils.

No more the Paedagogue, with brandish'd rod,
Annoys my sides, nor stuns with deathful sounds
My startled ears; for now, with transport heard,
The joyful mandate summons me away,
To where fam'd Isis rolls her laureate wave;
On whose gay banks an ancient city stands,
Crown'd with an hundred spires, and swelling domes
Modern, or Gothic, stately to the view:
Hither, 'tis said, from Athens' widow'd bow'rs
By Persian pride and civil rage expell'd,
Dame Wisdom fled of yore, and with her came,
Leaving the fabled haunts of Castaly,
Nine beauteous maids, who boast their birth from Jove:
High on these pinnacles enthron'd they reign,
"To us invisible, or dimly seen,"
Except by soaring fancy's keener glance.
Around their shrines, from Britain's farthest bound,
Array'd in sables, croud a motley race;
Distinct with various titles, and degrees
As various &mdash; high above the rest appear
Two forms of more majestic port and mien,
Whose soverain rule the toga'd race obey,
Hight Proctors; by their sleeves of ominous sweep,
Of Genoa's looms the fam'd produce, well known,
And dreaded; these in order next, and next
In dignity, a tribe of sages stand,
Dreadful with Tippet, source of dire dismay
To Freshmen, and the whole unbearded race;
Their office to support and poise the scale
Of steady justice, from the peaceful shades
Of science to repel the barbarous sons
Of Insolence, and Faction's wild uproar;
Nor are there wanting, who, with ponderous mace,
May add to mild reproofs vindictive blows,
Full often rued by many a heedless wight.

But now array'd in like mysterious stole,
With flowing band, that saintly ornament,
Hung waving from my chin, I issue forth
To seek the mansion of a learned sage,
Yclep'd a Tutor; him aloof I ken,
On elbows twain of antient chair reclin'd,
With cobwebs hung, by time's sharp tooth defac'd,
Midst volumes piled on volumes all around
And dusty manuscripts; treasures I ween
Of antient lore:  He sullen from his chair
Reclines not, till with many an aukward bow
And strain right humble I implore his grace.
Questions the sage proposes, dark, perplex'd;
Of various import &mdash; and to sound my skill
O'er many an author turns, to me well known,
Virgil or Horace, or the dreadful page
Of Homer, name accurst &mdash; descending hence
His steps at awful distance I pursue,
Admiring much my strange unwonted garb,
And wond'rous head-piece; till at length we reach
The mansion of a venerable Seer,
Second alone of all the letter'd race,
Who opes a mighty volume, graced with rows
Of various names, in seemly order rang'd;
'Midst these the humblest of the muse's train
Enrolls his name:  and Isis hails her son.
Some mystic sounds pronounc'd, with trembling lips
The sacred page I kiss, and from his hand
A book receive, of small regard to see,
With godly counsels fraught, and wholsome rules;
Which ill betide the wight who dares offend.
The wonted fees discharged, I haste away
To join the circle of my old compeers,
Sever'd by cruel fate &mdash; The hearty shake,
The friendly welcome, go alternate round:
And that blest day, till eve's remotest hour,
Is sacred to our joys &mdash; Its choicest stores
The genial larder opes; exhausted deep,
Even to its inmost hoards, the buttery groans.
But now the bottle rolls its ample round,
Kindling to rapture each congenial soul;
The burst of merriment, the joyous catch
Ring round the roofs incessant &mdash; much is talk'd
Of past exploits, and grievous tasks impos'd
By former Tyrants; tyrants now no more.
Transported with the thought, in frantic joy
I raise my arm, and midst surrounding shouts,
Quaff the full bumper; ah full dearly rued!
Stern fortune, thus ev'n in the cup of bliss
To mix the dregs of woe &mdash; a deadly hue
Sudden invests my cheeks, my fainting soul
Is fill'd with horrid loathings and strange pangs,
Unfelt before, convulsing all my frame:
Med'cines are vain, or serve but to augment
My grievous plight, till some experienc'd friend
Lead me to neighbouring couch, where grateful sleep
Soon o'er my senses sheds her opiate balm.

Heard with less terror, now, the tolling bell
Summons my foot-steps to that awful dome,
Whose gaudy windows, all superbly dight
With various tints, and quaint historic lore,
Tempt from devotion's page the roving eye&mdash;  
Mysterious studies next my thoughts employ;
Figures and lines, with nicest art to range,
Oblique or square, and time, and mode, and space,
Perplex my brains &mdash; Now Logic, rugged maid,
Opens her stores profound, the wavering mind
To fix aright, and guide the excentric thought:
Sage doctrines, nathless unrestrained I rove
At large, and riot in successive rounds
Of new delight:  Now up the silver stream
To Medley's bowers, or Godstowe's fam'd retreat,
Straining each nerve, I urge the dancing skiff;
Or, rushing headlong down the perilous steep,
Rouse the sly Reynard from his dark abode:
Or, if inclement vapours load the sky,
Tennis awhile the heavy hours beguiles;
Or, at the billiards fatal board, I stake
With anxious heart, the last sad remnant coin.

Tutors may chide, and angry Sires withhold
The wonted largess, their united rage
I wreck not; Ticking, gentlest maid, supports
My sinking fame, and all my woes beguiles.
O fairer far than all that Greece, or Rome,
In vaunting strain, of nymph or goddess tell;
To thee a thousand temples pierce the skies:
To thee a thousand altars ever smoke:
Great queen of Arts, without whose cheering ray,
Science wou'd droop, and Genius must expire.
Raising one general pray'r, of every rank
Unnumber'd suppliants throng thy crouded courts.
To thee, the haughty doctor, rais'd on high
To Learning's loftiest seats, tho' far renown'd,
Cringes submissive; thee with all his arts
The subtle lawyer seeks, nor heeds the voice
Of bailiff thundering at his neighbour's gates.
Propitious power, my lyre shall still be strung
To sing thy praise, my pencil still prepared
To paint thy charms &mdash; and well they may, I ween,
For thine the pencil is, and thine the lyre.

Whether the grape's rich juice regales my soul,
Or from the potent bowl I quaff new life,
Abhorrent still, I loath the nauseous fumes
Of that detested weed, Virginia hight,
Which the sage Don, in spiral clouds exhales,
Frequent and full, as o'er his drowsy malt
Gravely he nods &mdash; Be mine that milder leaf
Which Rowley's patriot hand, with studious care,
From hill, or wood, or flowery vale selects:
Cheer'd with its genial vapours oft I lounge
Beneath the Matron's roofs, or thine, O Kemp,
Mistaken Patriot, as, in high debate,
Of British freedom, and of British herb,
We reason much, nor weightier thoughts employ
My tranquil mind, but how the mantling bowl
With sweet, with sour, with spirit rightly mix'd,
May be replenish'd; oft by these inspir'd
From street to street, beneath the moon's pale beam,
Heedless I stray, if haply Proctor's voice
Check not my progress &mdash; "Siste" &mdash; deathful sound,
"What should I do, or whither turn &mdash; amaz'd,
Confounded," down some narrow lane I scower
Of famed St. Thomas, virtue's chaste retreat:
But vain my flight, for ruffian's cruel palms
Arrest my steps, and to the offended power
Force me reluctant &mdash; he aloud exclaims
Of broken faith, and violated laws,
Full many a tale he adds, of sage import,
And then with mandate stern, to college dooms
Me, hapless wight, with dreadful fines amers'd,
Till one long moon revolves her tedious round:
Some godly author, Tillotson perchance,
Or moral bard to conn, with heart full sad.
There long I sigh unfriended, and alone,
Unless some dun ascend my lofty dome,
At first with gentle foot, and suppliant voice,
But oft denied, and bolder grown, he adds
Vindictive menace, and before my eyes
Displays the horrors of that antient fort,
Drear mansion, where the sullen debtor pines,
'Midst circling gloom, and hunger's cruel rage:
While restless fancy to my sight presents
That dreaded volume, whose recording page
Brands, with eternal infamy, the wretch,
Incorrigible deem'd, whom dire misdeeds
Of darker stain disgrace:  me Phoebus flies,
And all the tuneful nine, tho' oft I try
With feeble nerve to string my useless lyre&mdash;
The time elaps'd, with throbbing heart I seek
The dreaded seer, and to his hand present
The letter'd page; with brow austere he reads
And bids me, from experience wise, beware
To rouse, a second time, his sleeping ire&mdash;

Thrice happy sons of Cam, whom Proctor's rage
Rarely molests, whether your snorting steeds
Snuff from afar Newmarket's well known breeze;
Or furious pant to gain the verdant heights
Of Gog-magog &mdash; O skill'd with dexterous hand
To smack the thong, and guide the aerial car;
By Trompington's or Barnwell's blooming dames,
Kenn'd with amaze:  How does each Isis beau
Envy your lot! &mdash; Slaves to no servile laws,
That pinion down their fancy, you disport
In gaudy silks, and various tinctured vests,
Best snares for female hearts; our humbler garbs
Subfuse, or sable, scarcely tempt the glance
Of wishful nymph, tho' many a nymph we boast,
As blithe, as blooming, and as bright as your's&mdash;

Why shou'd the muse of direr evils sing,
When Rustication, in her harpy fangs,
Hurries the wretch, from joy and Isis far,
In sylvan solitudes to waste his youth,
'Midst chiding aunts, and antiquated maids:
Or why, that last sad fate the wretched prove,
Exil'd for ever from her sacred haunts,
To roam, like Adam, thro' the desart earth,
"With all the world before them, where to choose
Their place of rest," yet after all find none.
Spurning each youthful folly, wiser I
Ascend, with graduate splendor, to the heights
Of classic dignity; in time perchance
May wield the fasces of proctorial power,
And be myself that Don, so lately fear'd.
