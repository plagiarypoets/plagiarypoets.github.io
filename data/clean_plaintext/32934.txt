Although the meaner sort (whose thoughts are plac'd
As in another region, far below
The Sphere of greatnesse) cannot rightly taste
What touch it hath, nor right her passions know:
Yet I here adventur'd to bestow
Words upon griefe, as my griefes comprehend,
And made this great afflicted Ladie show
Out of my feelings, what she might have pend.
And here the same, I bring forth, to attend
Upon thy reverent name, to live with thee
Most vertuous Ladie, that vouchsaf'st to lend
Eare to my notes, and comfort unto me,
That one day may thine owne faire vertues spread
Being secretarie now, but to the dead.
