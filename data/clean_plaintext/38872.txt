See Superstition, with dark scouling eyes,
Slow stalking o'er yon dusky gloom;
Now heaving deep foreboding sighs,
See her by turns each horrid shape assume.

There hid by tall trees of a mournful green,
Almost impervious to the sun's bright rays;
The lofty spire of a Convent's seen,
Secluded from the world's unhallow'd gaze.

There pensive Nuns slow count their solemn beads,
Consign'd for ever to the cloister'd gloom,
Pale Superstition each poor heart misleads,
And pining Sorrow robs them of their bloom.

Their sighs re-echo thro' the fretted walls,
Mild Patience casts to Heav'n her dove-like eyes;
Alas!  in vain, the gushing tears now fall;
Ah!  now, in vain, is heard those heartfelt sighs.

At distance now imperfect forms are seen,
Dimly to pass the winding chapel's way,
O'er the cold tomb see the pale spirits lean;
Wave their thin hands and slowly glide away.

But, hark!  why tolls the heavy Convent bell?
The whistling winds now make a solemn pause;
Alas!  they ring some hapless sister's knell,
That now they bear away a lifeless corse.

Now glimmering torches break the dismal gloom,
To earth mild Cynthia casts her beamy rays,
Some wretched victim seeks an early tomb,
For wasting Misery cut short her days.

The fathers now consign her to the earth,
Then to their narrow cells they slow return;
Within those darksome walls adieu to mirth,
The wretched sisterhood for ever mourn.
