As some fair floweret in an humble vale
Rises beneath a genial sky serene,
And lends new odours to the passing gale,
There mildly blooms unenvied and unseen;
Till some rude peasant wand'ring o'er the green
Resolves its fall, while beauty pleads in vain,
He, when no friendly hand uplifts between,
Tramples, and leaves it pining on the plains:
So hapless Mary, first in Beauty's train,
Unknown, unenvied, bloom'd a village maid;
Till he, who dar'd each sacred rite profane,
In borrow'd guise th' unconscious fair betray'd!
To her deceiv'd, forsaken, left to mourn,
The heaving sigh of pity still must turn!
