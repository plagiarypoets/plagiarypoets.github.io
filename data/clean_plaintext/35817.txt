Far in the night, the hoary chieftain cast
Historic ken of his unfaded eye;
Told of the eastern and the western blast,
Of lights clear trembling in the northern sky;
Of orbs with locks of radiance flaming high,
The symbol plow and hieroglyphic wain,
The evening star that peers, a heavenly spy,
O'er shepherd while enfolding of his train,
With each new waken'd light in evening's solemn reign.

Then would he lingering on his path explain
How from the etherial skirts of dying day,
To quote to-morrow's sunshine, storm, or rain,
Or when Aurora glanc'd through silver gray,
To read her passage up the eastern way,
And from the golden crescent of the moon,
Know what the corn in green-shot blade would slay,
Or from the darkling prodigies at noon
Tell when ambition's shoots the Almighty meant to prune.

The reverend chieftain kindled at the sight,
And shook his locks like Spring's remaining snow;
And from the aspect of the colouring night
Divin'd what none save those inspired know,
Of blood-shot war a sad disastrous flow;
And gaz'd, as waking from a troubled dream,
On fiery squadrons tilting to and fro,
And blazing comets red portentous beam,
That famin'd heaven's field, and set the world agleam.

The livid terror, perish'd in the glow
Of sprightly pleasance sparkling on his cheek,
He heaven-ward turn'd his clear unmated brow,
His heart big-heaving hindering him to speak;
He saw, in vision, Scotland's cottage reek
O'ercurl in peace steeds smoking in the plow,
Up to her mountain's heaven-related peak,
And harvests waving richness grandly flow
O'er Cheviot's sunny top, and Pentland's clefts of snow.

And all around her he beheld array'd,
Nations o'er nations in tumultuous jar,
Harness war-steed, and whet the battle blade,
And issue on the cannon from the car,
With flaunting flags of conflict waving far,
And all the world one blaze of furnace flames,
Keen fabricating arms for Scottish war;
Where laughing hind his steed for tillage tames,
And cheerful plies the plow in land of lovesome dames.

It was, I ween, a sad appalling sight
For eye that ventured into future time,
To mark bright nations darkening into night,
And others starting from barbaric clime,
Lifting their foreheads o'er the world sublime
A little while &mdash; then dropping to decay,
And others from their warlike ashes climb&mdash;
The sorrowing chieftain shook his ringlets gray,
And, leaning on his staff, he homeward took his way.
