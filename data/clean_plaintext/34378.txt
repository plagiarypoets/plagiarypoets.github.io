A Gentle knight was pricking on the plaine,
Ycladd in mightie arms and silver shield,
Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine,
The cruell marks of many a bloudy fielde;
Yet armes till that time did he never wield:
His angry steede did chide his foming bitt,
As much disdayning to the curbe to yield:
Full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt,
As one for knightly giusts, and fierce encounters fitt.
