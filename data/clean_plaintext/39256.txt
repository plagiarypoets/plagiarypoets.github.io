When the tempest howls rough thro' the dark wither'd grove,
And the rude blasts of Winter all Nature deform;
Amid the dire scenes unappall'd I could rove,
And rest undisturb'd by the rage of the storm.

Yet why, when the wild winds of Winter are flown,
When hush'd to repose are the waves on the sea;
When Spring o'er the earth her green mantle has thrown,
And the sweet voice of gladness is heard from each tree:

When all the fair objects that earth can bestow,
Combine to inspire me with transports of joy,
O why on my tongue dwell the accents of woe?
Why bursts from my bosom the sorrow-fraught sigh?

When the blushes of morn tinge the clouds of the east,
I seek the lone cave on the wave-beaten shore
Where the sea-bird screams wild as she starts from her nest,
And the loud-sounding surge in the hollow rocks roar:

I mark the tall cliff, hoary, rugged, and bare,
That rears its broad breast in the midst of the waves,
Where the mermaid, they say, often combs her dark hair,
And sings o'er the sailors that rest in their graves.

When the sun sinks behind the high hills of the west,
All lonely and pensive I rest by the stream,
I call to remembrance the days that are past,
And compare all my joys to the suns' setting beam.

I see with regret where the hawthorn stood,
And the yellow furze blossom'd, the marks of the plough,
Yet pleas'd I behold the rock shatter'd and rude,
And view with delight the bleak mountain's bare brow.

Beneath the green elm waving dark in the air,
Oft I sit while the moon lights her lamp in the sky&mdash;
Ah!  why must I tell that my Peggy sleeps there,
And that there all my hopes and my happiness lye?
