In ages that time has long since stole away,
Ere virtue by science was taught to decay;
Young nature such lengths in her wantonness run,
That she now and then gave us a monster for fun:
Strange hydras, and dragons, and things without name,
Stole honest mens lives, and repaid 'em with fame.
But living so long, and encreasing so fast,
Great Jove thought it fit to destroy 'em at last:
Tho' deem'd it beneath him, as he was a god,
To come and demolish an evil so odd;
So pleasure, and profit, at once to unite,
Resolv'd to get one who shou'd set matters right:
And leaving his wife, and his thunder behind,
To sleep on his eagles, and scold to the wind,
At once to Alcmena and Earth he was civil,
And hence 'rose Alcides &mdash; a good out of evil!
Then monsters were slain, nor was one to be found,
To feed on mankind, or incumber the ground:
But Hercules dy'd &mdash; and alas!  we behold,
New monsters are made, not by nature but gold;
And wear such disguise, I'm told without joke,
That some have a garter and star for a cloke;
And some yet more sly, are disfigur'd with lawn,
Some wound with a smile, with a song or a kiss;
And some can destroy with a no or a yes:
Here's sphynxes, hyenas, and hydras, such store,
They'd employ mighty Jove, with one Hercules more.
O then aid us this once!  put an end to the strife,
Myself (and she's handsome) will lend you my wife.
But stay &mdash; let me see &mdash; when my horns are come out,
He'll take even me for a monster, no doubt;
Then lest I shou'd share in the general drub,
Transform me, Oh Jupiter, into his &mdash; club.
