Young Thyrsis, the thoughtless and gay,
Was first at each Revel and Sport;
He frolick'd most jocund the Day,
At Eve to each Nymph paid his Court.

Wherever a Pastime, or Show,
Caus'd Pleasure's gay Circle to meet,
Young Thyrsis was certain to go&mdash;
His Presence gave Zest to the Treat.

The Sports of the Chase and the Field
Afforded to Thyrsis delight;
The Joys that sweet Musick can yield,
Crown'd often with Rapture his Night.

The Old and the Prudish repin'd
The Heir of their Lord was so wild;
But those who well knew him could find
He candid was, courteous, and mild.

At Length good Acasto, his Sire,
Met Time &mdash; who had Charge of his Doom;
The Shepherds all wept, and each Lyre
Tun'd mournfully over his Tomb.

Now Thyrsis is Lord of the Dale,
And throws all his Foibles aside;
His Actions his Goodness reveal;
The Villager's Patron and Pride!

Acasto's good Deeds, and mild Worth,
As Brilliant in Thyrsis appear;
So Britain!  in Time will burst forth
The Virtues of George in his Heir.
