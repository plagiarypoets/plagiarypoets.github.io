I dream of Arqua, and the hollow'd tomb
Where sleeps the lyre, whose undulating string
Stream'd notes of lady-love among the bloom
Of music-breathing flow'rs, in early spring:
Their dew, love's tears &mdash; the fragrance which they fling
On earth and air, the odour of the sigh
Of her so lov'd &mdash; the hue, bright as the wing
Of Iris, was the love-smile of her eye,
That beam'd upon the chords with softest witchery.
