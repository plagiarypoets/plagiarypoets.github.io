Fair Peace!  descend, and bless our Isle:
Make Slaughter cease and Commerce smile,
Where War has held his Reign;
May Britons on a distant Shore
No longer hear the Cannons roar,
Nor press th' insanguin'd Plain.

No more let Mars with purple Hands
Destroy the Hinds that till'd the Lands,
And sow'd the yellow Grain;
Break his dread Spear, his Arms remove,
Let Amity and social Love
Our former Feuds restrain.

Ah see!  Britannia's weeping stands
With pallid Looks and lifted Hands,
While Heroes great in Fight
(Who once defy'd proud Gallia's Chain)
By Friends, by once-lov'd Brothers slain,
Are sunk in endless Night.

Do thou, mild Pow'r!  our rage controul,
Wake tend'rest Passions in each Soul;
Remove our dread Alarms:
Drive civil Discord far away,
Make Nations court thy gentle Sway,
And quit their fulgent Arms.

Oh instant raise propitious Gales
To swell the Bark's white-spreading Sails,
That wafts to foreign Climes
Sage Heroes, taught by Wisdom's Lore,
To bid fierce Contests rage no more,
That discompose the Times.

Do thou attend their distant Course,
And urge their Suit with lenient Force,
To make a Nation bless'd;
Let civil Broils no longer Rage,
Nor Friends with Friends in War engage;
But soothe their Minds to Rest:

So shall fair Commerce live again,
Her Ships shall grace the azure Main
With Wealth's exhaustless Store;
And Plenty too shall fill the Plains,
And glad the hearts of lab'ring Swains,
Whose Parents bled before.
