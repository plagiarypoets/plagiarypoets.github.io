'Tis pleasant in the young fresh morn of May,
When blossoms bud, and flow'rets bloom,
To walk around, and hail the 'wakening day,
Through hawthorn-scented fields, and breathe their soft perfume;
But sweeter far than this it is to rove
Through the heart's fairy world &mdash; the early dream of love!

'Tis pleasant in the summer's golden hours,
When clust'ring roses blush along our way,
To muse by cooling streams &mdash; in shady bowers,
Till Eve's pale beam subdues the god of day;
But sweeter far than this it is to rove
Through the heart's fairy world &mdash; the early dream of love!

'Tis sad to watch th' autumnal vine leaves fall,
Faded and dying at the close of day;&mdash;
(Those emblems of mortality recall
Visions of early hopes &mdash; long past away!)
But far more sad than this, it is to mourn
The blossoms of the heart &mdash; that never can return!

'Tis sad to mark, when winter's icy breath
Freezes  the stream, and strips the blighted spray,
All nature sunk in the repose of death,
Till spring's warm blushes wake her into day;
But far more sad than this, it is to mourn
The winter of the heart &mdash; whose spring shall ne'er return.
