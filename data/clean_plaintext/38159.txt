Right wele of lerned Clerkis is it sed,
That womenhud for mannis use is made;
But naughty man liketh not one or so,
He lusteth aye unthriftily for mo;
And whom he whilome cherished, when tied
By holy church, he cannot her abide.
Like unto dog which liteth of a bone,
His tail he waggeth, glad therefore y-grown;
But thilke same bone if to his tail thou tie,
Pardee, he fearing it away doth fly.
