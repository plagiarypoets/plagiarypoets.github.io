The mighty OAK, now level'd low,
The victim of the axe's blow;
(Great Metamorphosis of ART,
Chang'd by a tool in whole and part;
Thus forests turn to fleets on ocean,
And trees, as carts, are set in motion;)
The Cutters now their work survey,
And join to bear the spoils away;
The burthen on their shoulders bore,
And sought the nearest river's shore;
With ease the weighty load they move,
For ev'ry man with vigour strove;
Just at the goal, a selfish fool,
Averse to wisdom's wholesome rule,
His shoulders from the burthen drew,
His private ends alone in view;
Another knave, and still another,
Withdrew his shoulder like his brother;
The honest few still kept their post,
Till weight and strength the balance lost;
And while with zeal they forward push'd,
Down fell the wood, and all were crush'd.

THE MORAL.
Learn from this tale, ye Miser knaves,
He gains a loss who Taxes saves;
The haughty Lord, who shuts out light,
And stops a window up in spite;
Who turns his servant's coat to 'scape
The tax upon a liv'ry cape;
Or, hates the Tax so wisely hit on,
To make a Beau a useful Briton;
By meanly saving things in small,
May bring down ruin on his all&mdash;
He most shou'd bear who most is able,
Or States will fall like Log in Fable.
