Hail silent moral'st!  where, in times of yore,
The voice of Gladness, sounded thro' thy dome;
Whose festive halls have chear'd the village poor,
And sent them happy to their lowly home.

Here Fathers may have hail'd their sons return
With knowledge that might grace their riper years&mdash;
And pale Affliction oft her cares might mourn,
And strive to drown her sorrows in her tears.

Thy halls have rang when lovers of the chace,
Warm from the field have blest the sparkling bowl;
In jocund ring convers'd &mdash; the sons of ease!
And spoke aloud the rapture of the soul.

And many a happy pair might fondly stray,
And mark each beauty of thy glowing scene,
And listen to the sweetly-warbled lay,
And bless their mutual love and joys serene.

Perhaps some bosom by the Nine inspir'd,
Might, wand'ring, catch from hence the glowing line,&mdash;
Some tint which Nature's children may have fir'd&mdash;
Some thoughts that gave the breast to warmth divine.

Ah!  now how chang'd! &mdash; how wild appears the scene
Where Life and all its sweets were wont to glow;
Dread Desolation spreads the space within!
And briars &mdash; and mould'ring walls bespeak its woe!
