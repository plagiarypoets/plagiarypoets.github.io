Canst thou grow sad, thou say'st, as earth grows bright?
And sigh, when little birds begin discourse
In quick, low voices, ere the evening light
Pours on their nests, from out the day's fresh source?
With creatures innocent thou must perforce
A sharer be, if that thine heart be pure.
And holy hour like this, save sharp remorse,
Of ills and pains of life must be the cure,
And breathe in kindred calm, and teach thee to endure.
