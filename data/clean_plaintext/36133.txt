The seventh, CENSORIOUSNESS, with lip up curl'd,
Did on a snarling MASTIFF crooked ride,
At war with all that's fair in this foul world,
A compound of malignity and pride;
For ever prone to censure and to chide,
She praises only where she might reprove,
Nor worth in man or woman can abide,
Stranger to Friendship, execrating Love,
She courts the raven dark and harasses the dove.

Holds man that "JEWELL in a thrice-barr'd chest,"
In days when faith and fealty both wax cool,
A plain bold spirit in a loyal breast,
An heart long-train'd in honour's goodly school?
This deadly fiend, who aims on earth to rule,
Will urge her minions to deface his fame,
To blast him as a bigot or a fool,
To call his worth some ignominous name,
And crush  him with a load of obloquy and shame.

The eighth was black INGRATITUDE, who perch'd
Upon HYENAS back most warily,
Around her with an eye of Argus search'd
For hapless victims of her perfidy.
Hated by GOD, and eke by man is she,
Doom'd in the sacred volume to partake,
With wizard foul, the dismal destiny,
That sends them as the offspring of the snake,
To feel th' eternal fire of Acherontic lake.

Who has not mark'd INGRATITUDE's pale eye,
Which owns an obligation in the mind,
Yet from a friend, as from a foe would fly,
Nor temper with one kindly glance the act unkind.
And oft, too oft to Love's strong power resigned,
The beauteous Maiden by this Daemon won,
Was doom'd in lover false, a foe to find,
Who spurn'd her from his feet, deceiv'd, undone,
To wander thro' a cold, wide world, unpitied and alone.

"And after all, upon the waggon beam,
Rode SATAN, with a snarling whip in hand,
With which he forward lash'd the lazy team,
So oft as SLOTH still in the mire did stand.
Huge routs of people did about them band,
Shouting for joy, and still before their way
A foggy mist had cover'd all the land,
And underneath their feet all scatter'd lay,
Dead sculls and bones of men whose life had gone astray."
