Worm of the night, thee let the Poet view,
And learn to point his mental spark aright,
When on the way-side bank, light sprent with dew,
Thou kindlest thy green lamp of emerald bright,
Pure, self-illum'd; not with the borrowed light
Tinsel'd, like busy insects of the day,
Thou giv'st a brilliance to the silent night
That cheers the homeward traveller on his way.
Poor worm, (the pensive Poet well might say)
Ev'n HE that lit thee on this humble soil,
Hung all yon lamps that His high dome array,
And feeds their fires with everlasting oil,
And ev'n my lamp, poor worm, like theirs and thine,
Shines not in vain if in HIS praise it shine.

Lord, when I look upon thy starry sky
With pearls enpath'd like scatter'd dust of gold,
I humble me, lost in amazement high
To think what he, thy gifted son, hath rold,
Far-sighted NEWTON; that round each are roll'd
Unnumber'd worlds. &mdash; And then I marvel sore
That any eye can Thy works behold
Should in the schoolmen's tangled volumes pore,
That every age may garble o'er and o'er,
Yet cannot blot from Thine the smallest part.&mdash;
GOD!  though I cannot comprehend their love,
I bless thy hallow'd name with humble heart,
And hope with them, uncumber'd of my clay,
Sabbath'd in peace to see thy bright eternal day.
