STROPHE.
What shrieks burst thro' the darken'd air!
The dismal sounds I hear again!&mdash;
Ah!  see, encircled by this baleful train,
The black, grim-visag'd Genius of Despair!

Yonder he stands!  Around him wait,
In all the pomp of sullen state,
Remorse and Guilt, whose troubled breast
Hope's flatt'ring gales ne'er lull to rest;
While Conscience acts the Torturer's part,
And gnaws with venom'd stings their heart.
And there, while Danger's giant form
Stalks thro' the horrors of the hurtling storm,
(Whose howl what mortal unappall'd can hear?)
Shivers aghast the phantom Fear.
There Madness too, whose shatter'd hair,
Wildly streaming mocks the air;
His bloody eye-balls sparkle fire,
And burst with ineffectual ire.
While still by fits he shakes his hundred chains,
Or grins a ghastly laugh, or roars along the plains.

ANTISTROPHE.
By the transient gleams of light
I see what yet escap'd my sight!
I see a self-devoted band,
Each holds a poniard in his hand;
Despondence marks each downcast face,
And sad Reflection's gloomy trace.
With banning voice, that rends the sky,
They call  Despair:  Despair is nigh
Far from the realms of chearful day
The night-born chieftain leads the way.
High on yon cliff's tremendous brow,
That shades the gulf of Death below,
Awhile they stand:  Hell's ravening brood,
In one harsh scream their joy declare;
(The sound still vibrates on my ear.)
Prelusive lightnings dart around,
And bellowing thunders shake the ground.
Amidst the elemental shock
They deeply strike the sudden blow;
Then plunge impetuous from the rock,
And sink beneath th' o'erwhelming tide below.
