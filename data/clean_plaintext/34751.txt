Haste not so fast, on worldly cares employ'd,
Thy bleeding Saviour asks a short delay:
What trifling bliss is still to be enjoy'd,
What change of folly wings thee on thy way?
Look back a moment, pause a while, and stay.
For thee thy God assum'd the human frame;
For thee the guiltless pains and anguish try'd;
Thy passion (sin excepted) his became:
Like thee he suffer'd, hunger, wept, and dy'd.
