Sweet Paradise!  of fair and reddening hue,
Around my lonely cottage-walls entwin'd!
Thy fresh young buds, enrich'd with Maia's dew,
With fragrant sweetness scent the evening wind!
Here as I sit, in Spring's gay bower reclin'd,
And Flora's tribes, thick varying, round me see;
Not all their charms &mdash; their boastful beauties join'd,
In choice simplicity can vie with thee!&mdash;
Type of the social heart!  who lovingly
Peepest ofttimes my lattic'd casement thro'&mdash;
Blushing scarce seen, like village-maiden shy,
Her rose-complexion'd sweetness known to few!
Wind, then, around my porch, thy tendrils gay,
Flora's young frolic child!  thou perfum'd guest of May!
