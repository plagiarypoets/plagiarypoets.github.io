Hail, unknown gen'rous friend!  to thee are due
My grateful thanks &mdash; and fain the hand of mine
Would cull one flow'ry scion &mdash; such as you
Amidst thy laurel'd chaplet would entwine.
Come, GRATITUDE!  thou heaven-born maid divine,
Shed o'er me thy soft influence, and inspire
My lowly Muse to weave at Friendship's shrine
An amaranthine wreath, &mdash; come strike the lyre.
In grateful strains a friend unknown, sincere,
Demands the tribute! &mdash; Pity's streaming eye
Embalms with tears lamented Bloomfield's bier!
Where watchful angels ever hover nigh!
Base Envy's frown shall ne'er obscure his fame,
While virtue sheds her ray on his immortal name.
