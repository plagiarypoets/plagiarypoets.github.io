Not unfamiliar to mine ear,
Blasts of the night!  ye howl as now
My shudd'ring casement loud
With fitful voice ye beat.

Mine ear has dwelt in silent awe,
The howling sweep, the sudden rush;
And when the pausing gale
Pour'd deep the hollow dirge.

Once more I listen; &mdash; sadly communing
Within me &mdash; once more mark, storm-cloth'd,
The moon, as the dark cloud
Glides rapidly away.

I, deeming that the voice of spirits dwells
In these mysterious moans, in solemn thought,
Muse on the choral dance
The dead-man's jubilee.

Hark, how the spirit knocks, how loud
Ev'n at my window knocks &mdash; again&mdash;
I cannot, dare not sleep&mdash;
It is a boist'rous night.

I would not, at this moment, be
In the drear forest-groves, to hear
This uproar and rude song
Ring o'er the arched aisles.

The ear doth shudder at such sounds
As the unbodied winds, in their disport,
Make in the hollow woods
When man is gone to sleep.

There have been heard, unchristian shrieks
And rude distemper'd merriment,
As tho' the autumnal bands
Were all in morrice dance.

There's mystery in these sounds:  and I
Love not to have the grave disturb'd,
And dismal trains arise
From the unpeopled tombs.

Spirits, I pray ye, let them sleep
Peaceful in their cold graves, nor waft
The sear and whisp'ring leaf
From the inhumed breast.
