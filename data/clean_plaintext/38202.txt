Beautiful gem, upon the brow
The hoary brow of ancient night,&mdash;
Beautiful gem, that tremblest now,
Mild and pure with thy tranquil light;
Ever holy and ever bright,
Shine forever, beautiful star!
Blissful promise and sweet delight
Shower still from thy golden car,
When the hushed winds are still, as now they are.

Beautiful gem, in the glorious crown
Of heaven purest and holiest;&mdash;
Beautiful star, that pourest down
All things sweetest and all things best,&mdash;
Now thou bringest the weary rest;&mdash;
Care and trouble and toil retreat;&mdash;
Bringest the bird to his downy nest,&mdash;
Bringest the youth to his loved one's feet,&mdash;
And bright smiles to the home where child and mother meet.
