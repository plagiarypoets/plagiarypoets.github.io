Pensive for Ireland's good, Orgoglio sate,
Revolving many schemes t' improve her state.
Near his pavilion, kept for grand parade,
Growling in chains a savage Tigress play'd:
Her shackles broke, impatient of delay,
The beast sprung forth to seize upon her prey:
But Pallas, guardian of the garter'd Knight,
Warn'd him to seek for safety by his flight.
Instant he fled; but chanc'd, in his retreat,
An heroine wife of Titan-blood to meet.
Soon as she saw his flight; &mdash; "Oh!  Shame, she crys,
What recreant vision mocks Typhoea's eyes?
Shall it, ye Gods, in History be read,
My great Orgoglio from a Tigress fled?"
The Chief reply'd; &mdash; "Ah cease this haughty huff,
One at a time for any Knight's enough."
