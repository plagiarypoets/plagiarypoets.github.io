Were I to name, out of the times gone by,
The poets dearest to me, I should say,
PULCI for spirits, and a fine, free way;
CHAUCER for manners, and close, silent eye;
MILTON for classic taste, and harp strung high;
SPENSER for luxury, and sweet, sylvan play;
HORACE for chatting with, from day to day;
SHAKSPEARE for all, but most, society.
But which take with me, could I take but one?
SHAKSPEARE, &mdash; as long as I was unoppressed
With the world's weight, making sad thought intenser;
But did I wish, out of the common sun,
To lay a wounded heart in leafy rest,
And dream of things far off and healing, &mdash; SPENSER.
