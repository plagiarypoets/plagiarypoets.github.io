The Cuckoo now shall mock the Nightingale,
The thistle have the blushing rose in scorn,
The lofty mountain bend unto the vale,
And the brief taper overlight the Morn:
Now shall all things, that were to Empire born,
Find dimunition in their proper sphere,
True beauty now shall out of price be worn,
And virtue serve, that sate without a peer:
Precedency shall fly from out the year,
And fixture be engraft with swallow's wings,
Now moles shall 'gin to see, and rocks to hear,
And rivers shall run backward to their springs:
All this, and more, seem not so strange to me,
As knowledge, school'd by vile authority.
