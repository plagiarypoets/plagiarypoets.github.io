With slow step, along the desert sand,
Where o'er the parching plains broods red dismay,
The Arab chief leads on his ruthless band.
And, lo!  a speck of dust is seen to play,
On the remotest confines of the day.
Arouse!  arouse!  fierce, does the chieftain cry,
Death calls!  the caravan is on its way!
The warrior shouts.  The Siroc hurries by,
Hush'd is his stormy voice, and quench'd his murderous eye.
