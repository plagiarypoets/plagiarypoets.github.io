Happy the man, who free from cares and pain,
Neither in hand, nor leg, nor foot retains
The gout corroding; he nor envious sees
His neighbour walk; nor sighs for absent love.
But when the sun dispels the Ccouds opaque,
To Datchett, park, or terras high repairs;
Where some neat nymph, whose halfway-meeting smiles
Gladden approach, attracts his hastening steps,
B&mdash;df&mdash;d or S&mdash;y&mdash;r; he each circling day
Improves, now musing o'er th' instructive tale,
Now hinting love oblique with accents low,
Or wit ambiguous, by design mistook.

But I, whom Ate's twitching throbs torment,
And passion (sure attendant upon gout)
Estrang'd to wine, whose gen'rous purple draughts
On tiptoe keep the spirits, pine and mope,
Chain'd, as by magic, to my elbow-chair;
There lonely sit for hours, and days, condemn'd
To count the tardy clock; or gaze at fire,
Where fancy'd pictures please the dazzled sight:
Save when a book (sure comfort in distress,
But relish'd least when by compulsion us'd)
The ling'ring hours beguiles; or when a friend
By social presence smooths the ruffled brow,
He then, with jocund and well-meaning mirth,
Derides my state, by his derision eas'd.
Not wittier jeers th' insulting amorous fop
On Delia casts, when injur'd love has rais'd
A pimple red, or morphew on her cheek,
Or the arch'd promontory of her nose,
To vex the cruel fair:  He, skill'd in taunts,
Cull'd out from chronicles of slighted knights,
Reviews his mem'ry's ample magazine;
Then in a mirrour's faithful Surface shews
Her boasted face now hideous to herself:
Or jokes of sweethearts frighten'd at her sight,
Those who at humble Eton vent their sighs
To father Thames, or pine in Windsor shades,
Fit haunts for dying swains; where spreading elms
Their am'rous arms in close embrace unite,
Whisp'ring their loves with ev'ry gentle breeze,
(Emblem of those they shade) they well may vie
With myrtle groves, or amaranthine bow'rs.

Thus, while some happy minutes rapid flow,
With sudden rage, and unexpected ire,
Ate, by Gods, by mortals gout yclep'd,
Thro' all my inmost nerves, like lightning, darts
Her baleful shafts, and kills without a wound:
With tort'ring rack thrice vellicates my foe,
With hideous accent thrice I scream, and feel
Her whole divinity enrag'd within.
What can I do?  to bathe my tortur'd limb
But adds new pangs; the gout invincible
Derides and baffles all the pow'r of herbs.
Patience alone remains, she, peaceful maid,
Time's meekest daughter, by complacence mild
And assiduity, the goddess calms,
And brings her flannel'd votary to ease.
