When Freedom, drest in blood-stain'd vest,
To ev'ry Knight her war song sung;
Upon her head wild weeds were spread,
A goary faulchion by her hung.
She danc'd on the heath;
She heard the voice of death;
Pale-ey'd Affright, his heart of silver hue,
In vain essay'd her bosom to assail;
She heard, unmov'd, the shrieking voice of woe,
And sadness, in the owlet, shade the dale.
She shook the pointed spear;
On high she held her shield,
The foe-men all appear,
And skim along the field.
Power, with his head exalted to the skies,
His spear a sun-beam, and his shield a star,
Like flaming meteors rolls his furious eyes,
Strikes with his iron feet, and sounds to war.
She sits upon a rock,
She bends before his spear,
She rises from the shock,
Wielding her own in air.
Hard as the thunder does she drives it on,
While veiled Prudence guides it to his crown;
His long, sharp spear, his spreading shield is gone,
He falls, the falling rolls ten thousands down.
War, gore fac'd War, by hideous Faction rous'd
His fiery helmet nodding to the air,
The bloody arrows in his straining hand.&mdash;
