Whan westlan' sins to rest fu' slily creept,
An' yont the hill the moon braid glowran peept;
Whan ilka lavrock quat her glomin' sang,
An' bursen clowns gaed hameward in a thrang,
Where Lomond's streams rin out to meet the Clyde,
An' thro' a bonny strath right clearly glide,
Twa youthfu' lads, wi' daffin' unco fain,
Ca'd down their bleaters 'cross the gowany glen:
Ilk ane a whistle had, an' weel cou'd they
Rant o'er a moorlan' reel or roundelay:
Whan Patie steek't the ewes in wattled fauld,
Thus Sandy 'gainst the lout began to scauld.

SANDIE.
Ah!  silly gouk!  it's nae thy want o' skill
Gars thee forget to blaw thy dainty quill.
Hae I na' hard thee ilka e'ening sing,
Wi' Jenny's praise mak a' the shealings ring?
Come gie's the best o' a' the routh ye hae;
Fu' snug we'll sit beneath this scougy brae,
Row'd in our plaids, an' Bauty by our side,
Gin mirk comes on us o'er the bent we'll glide.

PATIE.
Dear Sandy, man, I wadna like to stay,
The gait is lang, an' we may tine the way,
An' should the lasses frae the green be hame;
We'll meikle mischief get, and meikle blame:
What tho' I tell the hills my Jenny's praise,
Rough is my music, an' mair rough my lays;
Tho' were she mine, &mdash; how happy shou'd I be!
It's a' I want, and a' the gods can gie.

I'll warran', Sandy, ye hae seen the bow'rs,
Whan unco wither'd, bud wi' simmer show'rs;
Nae doubt fu' aften hae ye kent the knows
Sair crapt o' clover by the nibblin' ewes,
Wi' gowans spring, whan douk't by nightly dew,
An' daisies sprout whare anes nae daisies grew;
Just sae's my case when Jenny is awa',
Nor are the burnies clear, or hillocks bra';
Ilk thing about me wears a scoutin' lour,
An' berries sweet before are unco sour.
But whan my Jenny o' the green appears,
Claith'd in the hamely weat o' her forebiers;
Then a' my cares are in her arms forgot,
I envy not the laird his happier lot.
Sae blithe the lassie smiles, an' credit gie,
She's pleas'd wi' a' that haflins pleases me,
Nae mair I wanner doitit here an' there,
Or saunter thor'ess 'mang my wooley care,
But wi' my Jo gang to the sinny brae,
An' for her pu' the ripest berries blae;
For her select ilk dainty o' the field,
An' a' the nicer fruits our glennies yield.

The t' ither ouk we met ae blinkan' morn,
(That very day whan Geordy's wean was born,)
Beneath the bield o' yon auld birken tree;
Nane kent the tryst but Jenny's sell an' me:
Blithe, &mdash; blithe she leugh, an' ca'd me mony a name,
An' ferly'd what drave me sae air frae hame;
Yet soon flang down her pail and milkin' stoup,
My very saul wi' joy began to loup!
Nae bonnier looks cou'd ony lassie hae,
And her twa een glanc'd black as ony slae.
Her rosy cheeks and links o' saftest hair,
Gied a' my lammies to anither's care:
I soon forgat my bleaters on the bent,
Nor fash'd my head what gait my Colley went,
Whan to my breast I clapt my yielding lass,
O Sandy!  could ye guess how blithe I was!
E'en tears o' joy ran happin' o'er my chin,
An' sic a fit o' love I ne'er was in.
Nae honest lad cou'd e'er mair happy be,
An' Jenny seem'd right fain as well as me:
Lang, &mdash; lang we tauk'd beneath the birken bow'r,
An' a' the simmer-morn was scarce ae hour,
Till frae the braies came down the nucol ky,
Laith was my lass to part, an' sae was I.
Sair &mdash; sair she grat, and swore by a' on hi',
For weel or wae to lo'e ne'er ane but me,
An' as she spak, fu' gently did she fa',
Within my op'ning arms for good an' a',
I kist her aften, &mdash; saw her o'er the knows,
Then to the hill an' gather'd a' my ewes;
Lugg'd out my pipe, sine play'd a canty sang,
Till ilka bowm an' bank wi' Jenny rang,
Nor frae that morn hae I kent dole or pain,
I'm mair than blest since Jenny's a' my ain.

SANDIE.
Hegh!  honest Pate!  hae fairly ye can play,
An' thro' the glens gang whistlin' a' the day;
Wi' hame-content are a' the pantries stor'd,
A herd sae happy, wha wad be a lord?
But luckless I maun mint anither tune,
Scarce fit wi' a' my mirth, to soar aboon.
Ablins ye've heard o' dorty Peggy's sauce,
Whate'er I say, she only hums an' haws.
Sax ouks twice tauld I've gaen her faithfu' slave,
Nor has she anes glowr'd at me frae the lave:
Sic unco spite I can nae langer bear,
An' dread I'll ne'er put o'er anither year.
O Patie!  gin ye see the cruel maid,
Whan I'm at rest, an' 'neath the divots laid,
Tell her tho' she ne' lo'ed or pitied me,
O' ilka ane about she bore the grae:
That lang I woo'd &mdash; but woo'd her a' in vain,
An' sought a coffin to forget my pain,
Reed tine thy soun'!  nae mair, ye lav'rocks!  sing!
Nae mair, ye goudspinks!  gar the shealings ring!
Wild wanner 'cross the bens my fleecy care!
Ye simmer morns, nae langer blink sae fair!
Drap frae the lift ilk starnie o' the night,
An' smoot in mirkness sic a' waefu' wight!
Since Peggy's scornfu', what's the warld to me?
Gods!  hear my mein, an' ca' me up on hie'!

PATIE.
Hout!  hav'rel coof!  why mak ye sic a din!
That's nae the gait a dorty lass to win:
Tak ye my word, gie o'er that whinging cant,
Look unco blithe, 'mang a' the parish rant:
For Tibby buy a poutch, for Kate a snood,
An' frae the fair bring Bess a gauzen hood.
Rin after ilka quean, let Maggy pass,
Ne'er fash your head  ye ken o' sic a lass,
I'se warrant ye, fu' soon will she repent,
Her cauldrif heart o' a' it's pride relent;
She'll be your ain. &mdash; I'll wager, or't be lang,
The dorty dame will sing anither sang,
Whane'er ye like, ne'er stand to be your wife,
An' tak ye wi' your fauts for term an' life.

But see the morn in mist begins to lour,
An' frae the eastart comes a gathering show'r,
Nae doubt the swains are aff, an' aunty Kate
Will gie's a fleg for staying out sae late;
Right o'er the brae we'll bad, an' thro' the bent,
Hisk! &mdash; Bauty, rise!  an Sandy tak your kent.
