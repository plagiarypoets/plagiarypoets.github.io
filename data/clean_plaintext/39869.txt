Say, wilt thou write romantic tales like Scott,
With all of fancy's wild magnificence?
Or strike like Campbell, a deep organ-note,
That thrills with rapture every captive sense?
Or fill, like Moore, the songs of ardent passion
With far-fetch'd similes &mdash; a strange transgression?

Or wilt thou sit (like an hysteric maid)
Like Wordsworth, weeping o'er a faded daisy?
Or wrap thyself, like Coleridge, in a shade
Of unintelligible thoughts and mazy?
Or wade like Crabbe, through folly, vice, and dirt,
To talk with mortals that have scarce a shirt?

Wilt thou, like Byron, with distorted mind,
Clothe home-ideas like the eastern kings,
And send them back again to dupe the blind,
Who hail them all as new created things?
Or try, like Percy Shelly &mdash; very odd!&mdash;
To wound the pious, and insult thy God?

Or wilt thou venture, and succeed like Southey,
To pay addresses to the Epic Muse?
Or weave a web of recollections youthy,
As Rogers doth &mdash; though not of brightest hues?
Or like Montgomery, with a nameless art,
Pour forth the holiest feelings of the heart?

Wilt thou, like Hunt, twine out a little story
Already told &mdash; twine half its charms away?
Like Milman, whose heroics gain no glory,
Write bulky dramas no body can play?
Or versify, as Barry Cornwall doth,
The thoughts of others &mdash; soft and soothing both?

Wilt thou, like Hogg (though tinctured with barbarity)
Tell most delightful tales of fairy isles?
Like Bloomfield, who has lost his popularity,
Sing very pleasingly of rural toils?
Or throw, like Wilson, though too fond of dreams,
A light o'er nature which celestial seems?
