It is a fashion which beseemeth well
The imps who from the muses earst ysprong;
And on Parnassus mount are wont to dwell,
To pay their homage to the tuneful throng,
And eke to claim protection for their song
From them:  but vainest surquedry 'twould be,
If urged on by false ambition strong
And overweening pride, a wight like me
Should dare to ask their praise for my rude minstrelsy.

Ne would such amenaunce me ought avail,
For well I ween the muses know their own,
Ne may they be by any specious tale&mdash;
Or counterfeisance vile impos'd upon;
For evermore from out their glorious throne&mdash;
Bursts forth a radiance like the levin-flash,
Which if a faytor false but looks upon,
Straightway it doth his courage quite abash&mdash;
And into kindred dust his grov'lling spirit dash.

But though the cruel fates have me denied
The kind protection of the muses' power,
Nor safe with them would suffer me to 'bide
Far from the reach of any evil stower;
Yet, natheless, I resolved have to pour
An uncouth strain of ancient poesy,&mdash;
Such as whilom in Albion's happier hour,
Dan Spenser wont to tune his golden key;
Would that 'twere mine to breathe a verse so sweet as he.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

In sooth, it is a fact which none may doubt,
Who versed are in lovers' history,
That 'tis unwise in any simple lout,
To love a lady fair of high degree;
Yet, nathemore mought he persuaded be&mdash;
Such is his folly and fool-hardiment,
The idless of his vain pursuit to see:
But aye he strives with fix'd and firm intent,
To gain his tow'ring hopes a bright accomplishment.

Yet seldom doth he win the wish'd-for prize,
The cynosure of his fond heart's desire
Though he may pour his soul's impassion'd sighs,
In strains as sweet as from Apollo's lyre:
Ah, me, but little may the poet's fire,
Though breathing love's own eloquence avail,
If glitt'ring Mammon aid not to inspire
The constant flame full oft a true love tale&mdash;
Instead of joyous mirth will end in deepest bale.
