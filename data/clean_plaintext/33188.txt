PALLAS.
Welcome to earth and raigne.

ASTRAEA.  AGE.
But how without a traine
Shall we our state sustaine?

PALLAS.
Leave that to JOVE:  therein you are
No little part of his MINERVAS care.
Expect a while.
You farre-fam'd spirits of this happie Ile,
That, for your sacred songs have gain'd the stile
Of PHOEBUS sons:  whose notes they aire aspire
Of th' old Aegyptian, or the Thracian lyre,
That Chaucer, Gower, Lidgate, Spencer hight,
Put on your better flames, and larger light,
To waite upon the age that shall your names new nourish,
Since vertue prest shall grow, and buried arts shall flourish.

POETS DESCEND.
2. We come.
2. We come.
4. Our best of fire
Is that which PALLAS doth inspire.
