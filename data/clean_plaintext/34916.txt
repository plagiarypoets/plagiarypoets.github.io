On Redburn's bank two pining matrons sat,
Their tears fast dropping in the waters clear,
Each one lamenting for her absent mate,
Who at St. Alban's shook the murderous spear.
The nut-brown Elinor to Juga fair
Thus faintly spoke, with languishment of eyne,
Like drops of pearly dew glisten'd the quivering brine.

ELINOR.
Ah, gentle Juga!  hear my sad complaint!
To fight for York my love is drest in steel:
Oh!  may his White Rose with no blood be stain'd!
May holy Cuthbert watch Sir Robert well!
Much more than death in phantasy I feel.
See, see!  upon the ground he bleeding lies!
Infuse some healing balm, or else my lov'd Lord dies!

JUGA.
Sisters in sorrow, on this daisy bank,
Where melancholy broods we will lament:
Be wet with morning dews, and evening dank,
Like withering oaks, by rage of lightning rent,
Or like forsaken halls of merriment,
Whose gloomy ruins harbour the fell sprite,
Where deedly ravens croak, and owlets wake the night.

"No more shall minstrelsy awake our morn;
Farewell the dance, good chear, and morris-play;
No more the ambling palfry, and the horn,
Shall from the cover rouse the fox away."
I'll seek the forest all the live-long day,
All night, forlorn, thro' the lone church-yard go,
And to the flitting ghosts repeat my tale of woe.

ELINOR.
When shadowing clouds do hang upon the gleam
Of the pale moon, in silver mantles dight,
While happier minds enjoy the golden dream
Of fancy'd bliss, inspir'd by elves of night,
Then (but the saints forbid!)  if the sad sprite
Of my lov'd Lord his death should tell, &mdash; I'll hold,
And clasp, with dying arms, his bloody corse clay-cold.

So saying, like two tempest-blasted trees,
Or like two clouds, o'erswoln with heavy rain,
They mov'd with slow steps o'er the dewy meads
To where St. Alban's sacred shrines remain;
There did they find that both their Knights were slain:
Distraught, they hasted back to Redburn's side,
Yelled their knell of death, plung'd into the wave, and dy'd.
