October mounts his ebon throne,
In Scorpio Phoebus rules the day;
The foliage of the plain is gone,
Mild autumn's honours fade away,
And shivers at each blast:
Behold the rueful widow'd trees,
Their glories mourning in the breeze,
Which to the bleating winds are cast;
While skies prophetic of stern winter wear
A lowring sable robe, and bring the nipping air.

Descend, Calliope, blest muse,
Daughter of Memory divine!
Inspire a poet, who would chuse
The verse that seeks thy vestal shrine,
That art can't imitate:
Thy aid obtain'd, the humble swain
May soaring rise, and quit the plain,
On Fancy's wings new world's create,
Thro' seas, earth, air, and the wide circling sky,
Take in the boundless sight by thy all-piercing eye.

Did not dear Mem'ry still remain,
Could Needham's wit and beauty live?
Joys once possess'd would sure be vain:
But flying minutes to retrieve,
That lend to fancy wings;
Brightens each thought, and gives new fires,
She speaks, &mdash; and all the soul inspires,
While Rapture tip-to'd sweetly sings:
The flatt'ring image wears a livelier grace,
And shews a beauteous form, with an enchanting face.

Now barns receive their yellow stores,
Aloud proclaim the thrasher's flail;
Echo repeats the sounding floors,
Vibrating thro' the neigh'bring vale,
The rustic's lonely toil:
Encircled round with piles of wheat,
And sheaves lie spread beneath his feet,
Enraptur'd sees the golden spoil:
While threshing on his wooden sceptre waves,
And claims the tribute of ten thousand prostrate slaves.

Here Liberty, sweet goddess, reigns,
The guardian of her fav'rite isle;
Her empire gilds the fertile plains;
Here seated may she ever smile,
Nurse of each lib'ral art:
She makes Great Britain blithe and gay,
Benignity chears the happy day,
The lasting sun-shine of the heart!
Long, long may Britons share her placid smile,
For ever to remain the free, the happy isle.

New dipt in all the dies that glow,
Blest offspring sprung from Liberty,
That radiant shines in Iris' bow;
Come fancy, &mdash; ever fair and free,
A vot'ry with thee stray,
To boundless worlds in aether fly,
Revolving orbits to descry,
And swiftly skim the milky way:
To view the seas and plains, extended wide,
While in the curling dappled clouds sublimely ride.
