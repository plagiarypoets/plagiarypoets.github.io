Ill fares the wretch whom prudence cannot teach,
Whose heedless, fond affections led astray,
Fix on a fair one far beyond his reach,
To pine in hopeless sorrow day by day;
Restless each night, he starts but to complain;
While each succeeding sun only renews his pain.

Think'st thou, fond fool, a virgin gaily bred,
Will ever deign to spend a thought on thee;
Will give up views of splendor, fancy fed,
And stoop, for thy sake, to obscurity?
Hadst thou reflected thus in proper time,
Thou'd'st 'scap'd the grief that flows in this desponding rhime.

Ah!  what will honest tenderness avail,
Without or wealth to grace, or arts to please?
Worth greater far than thine would surely fail,
Out-bid, out-shone, excell'd, eclips'd by these!
'Tis not for thee with rivals to contend,
But in some lonely cell thy luckless life to spend.

Had fortune shower'd those gifts, alas denied!
Had rank and honours rais'd thee from the crowd;
To lay them at her feet had been thy pride,
Thine honour had from her acceptance flow'd;
Unhappy man!  see how thy sorrow teems!
For consolation driv'n to wild, delusive dreams.

Though thy sad heart, now deaden'd by despair,
It matters little what becomes of thee;
May Providence guard with especial care,
Th' unconscious auth'ress of thy misery;
May ev'ry wish of her's be gratify'd,
Heav'ns blessings all her own, and may no ill betide.
