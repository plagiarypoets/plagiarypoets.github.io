Not Tallyrand &mdash; though much that Seer foretold,
Of Northern winter's penetrating frost,
Intense of power!  and heart congealing cold,
Oceans of snow, and struggling armies lost,
With man and horse and arms the ground embost,
(Steel are those hearts, could see, and yet be gay),
My plight could tell, as Wilna's plains I crost,
Vincenza's Duke accompanied my way,
A murderer he!  a villain!  like myself:
We fly the fierce hourra!  of ruthless Cossack elf.

O'er the sledge top "sad horror with grim hew,
Did alwaies sore, beating his yron wings,
And after him owles and night ravens flew,
The hateful messengers of heavy things,
Of death and dolor telling sad tidings;
Whiles sad 'Vincenza,' sitting by my side,
A song of bale and bitter sorrow sings,"
Or peers around, in dread to be espied,
Nor I my "ugly face from living eye should hide."
