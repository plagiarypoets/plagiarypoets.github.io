ERIN, Forgive!  that of thy lovely Land,
Presumptuous have I dared so long to sing;
Attempting theme, that needed master-hand,
A golden Harp, and swept by Angel's wing.
But 'twas Affection led me to the string,
I felt a troubled joy, a strange desire,
Swell in my bosom, as thy bravest King
And Chiefs of other days in rude attire
Pass'd dim before mine eyes, and swept the feeble wire.

'Tis sweet to mark the consecrated spot,
Where Warriors won, and Minstrels sung their praise;
Where Virtue comforted, and Valor fought,
While Memory wakes the joys of other days,
And with enchantment every scene arrays:
But oh!  when Country's woven in the spell,
How do we cherish each sad caring trace,
That of her ancient majesty can tell,
Of wars which ERIN fought, and fields where Lochlin fell.

Thus is it when, the Warrior's heart has ceased
To beat, as once it did, to Glory's thrill,
Memory retails the thoughts that swelled his breast,
And, tho' with feebler throbbings, feels them still;
But now, farewell!  each tower, each fairy-rill,
That drew me, ERIN!  to thy praise: &mdash; the while
May each enchanting vale &mdash; each shadowing hill&mdash;
With Virtue, Pietry, and Friendship, smile,
And Peace, and Freedom, bless thro' time thy lovely Isle.
