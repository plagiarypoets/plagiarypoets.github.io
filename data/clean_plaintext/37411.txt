Angelic Seraphim!  from heav'n descend,
And let thy suppliant kiss thy placid breast,
Thy breast that never throbs
With dull, despondent sighs,
Or forms a wish beyond what virtue prompts,
Or hears invidious of another's wealth;
Fair Peace, thy sister-twin
Attends upon thy steps;
One constant dimple smiles upon thy cheek,
And on thy brow sits Fortitude serene,
That overlooks the clouds
Of complicated woe.
Thy gracious eye can harmonize Despair;
For taught by thee, the diabolic fiend,
An instant convert grows,
Exalted into Hope.
To what gay scenes of richly-chequer'd life
Fortune may lead; whatever prospects wide
The silver-finger'd nymph
May point out to my view;
Shed, shed, I pray, thy calm, thy temper'd rays,
Mild as the beam of heav'n on vernal flow'rs,
Or else my brain may swim,
And lordly Reason nod.
And oh!  (which health and industry forbid!)
If stern adversity should knit her brow,
And, deaf to Pity's call,
Enchain me in the cell,
Where bashful Poverty hangs down her head,
And weeps in silent want a real tear;
Be present to my aid,
To thee alone I sue,
Do thou, my good Samaritan, attend,
And in my wounds infuse thy healing balm;
So shall I thank my love
And laugh my pains away.
On this, my trust I build &mdash; for thou art good;
For oft times when thou shun'st
The blazing pomp of Courts,
Then art thou seen upon the mountain's brow,
Or gently straying o'er the rural vale,
Or  lifting up the latch
Of the grave Hermit's door.
