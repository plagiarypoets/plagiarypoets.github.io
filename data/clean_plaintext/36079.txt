TO MIRTH.
Daughter of Love and Rapture!  bright-ey'd Mirth,
As Hebe youthful, and as Pleasure gay,
Oh!  come and cheer a drooping son of Earth
With thy enchanting smile and heav'nly lay!
For Nature beam'd upon thy natal day,
And sent thee to this dark and lonely sphere,
To quicken Sadness with thy piercing ray,
And chase away the spectres &mdash; Care and Fear.
Then, nymph of dimpled smiles, approach me near:
See, see! &mdash; my heart expands! &mdash; she comes!  she comes!
Hark! &mdash; with her voice enraptur'd is my ear,
As misers at the sound of hoarded sums!
With myrtle crown'd, and rose, she bounds along,
While light-plum'd Joys and Laughters round her throng!

TO POETRY.
Oh!  for the lyre of Pindar, to rehearse
Fitly thy praise, divinest Poetry!
Then might I, in my immelodious verse,
Somewhat pourtray thy gorgeous majesty.
O, empress-queen of rare felicity!
'Tis thine to pour sublime the living lay,
And, borne on glittering Fancy's pinions free,
In emulation of the orb of day,
To gild admiring worlds with Glory's ray,
To make a Chaucer in dark ages shine,
A Spencer with imagination play,
A Milton beam refulgently divine,
And, high o'er all, a gifted Shakspeare rise,
To melt all hearts and captivate all eyes.
