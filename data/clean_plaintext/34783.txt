That potent monarchs sway'd,
And valiant warriors liv'd in days of old,
Tho' now their memory's decay'd,
We still believe, howe'er obscurity told,
As yet unknown the Poet's sacred flame,
That to the hero's deeds give endless fame.

Unlighten'd by the Muse,
Oblivion shrouds the honours of that age,
In vain another path to fame they'd chuse,
No power can force it, nor no worth engage.
From mighty Homer, thus the glory springs
Of great Achilles, and the King of Kings.

But for his verse, a thousand years agon,
That arduous siege had been unknown to fame;
Immortal still his work preserves the town,
Tho' now low ruins point its ancient frame.
Tho' gods its strong foundations laid in vain,
Thy ILLIUM, Homer, ever shall remain!

So vast the force of the poetic rage,
That glory ever waits the tuneful song,
Aeneas shines in Virgil's sacred page,
And fair Corinna is in Ovid young;
Eliza's fame in Spencer doth remain,
And Addison immoralizes Anne.

O could my numbers reach so bold a height,
While burning with my country's love I shine,
My lays should do some patriot's virtues right,
Or paint a Wilkes, or else describe a Glynn.
To latest days transmit their glorious fame,
And from the shining work deserve myself a name.
