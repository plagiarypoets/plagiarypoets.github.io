There is a moment of the darkest woe,
When the heart throbs, but cannot find relief,
The bosom swells &mdash; but not a tear will flow
To yield a channel to the noiseless grief:
A living monument, with glazed eye,
Upon the earth is fix'd our vacant stare,
And, if we breath a wish &mdash; it is to die;
In the cold grave to bury all our care,
And rest in undisturb'd repose for ever there!

Yes, we can yield us to despair like this,
And ask our God to take the life he gave;
In such a moment deem there's nought of bliss,
Save in the precincts of the silent grave.
We've lost our all &mdash; the life of life is fled;
The form we lov'd to gaze on is no more;
Our hopes are vanish'd, all our joys are dead,
And we care not how soon e'en life be o'er,
That we may sink to dreamless sleep for evermore!

The sun that gilds all nature with his beams,
That gives the summer's warmth, and beauty's glow,
To us the herald but of misery seems&mdash;
From fancied bliss wakes us to real woe:
Each thing we look on tells us of time past;
A thousand thoughts come rushing on the mind
Of early pleasures, far too sweet to last&mdash;
Of joys that fading left no trace behind&mdash;
And of that much lov'd being to the grave consign'd.

How many hearts responsive to my strain,
By sad experience, know this picture true,
And live that anguish'd moment o'er again
When the grave snatched for ever from their view
A dearer self: &mdash; No tear drop dimm'd the eye,
They did not call in frenzy on her name&mdash;
Ah, no!  they could not weep, they could not sigh,
And the chok'd voice could not an accent frame,
But grief raged in them with consuming flame.

Yet, 'tis not long such gloomy thoughts control
Th' enlighten'd mind.  Hope, with her angel sway,
Shedding rich lustre o'er the darksome soul,
Points to that realm of everlasting day,
When, when the throbbing heart shall cease to beat,
And the rude warrings of this world are o'er,
Congenial spirits shall in glory meet,
'Mid seraph forms shall meet, to part no more,
But in the presence of their God dwell and adore!
