Chloe's as cold as Ice, all Day,
And I still burn like Fire;
Why don't her Coldness melt away
Before my warm Desire?

Or why is not my fervent Blaze
Check'd by her chilling Ice;
But I grow hotter, as I gaze,
The Flames much stronger rise.

Strange!  that by Fire, which softens all,
More Hardness Ice should take,
And Ice, where-e'er it chance to fall,
A sudden Flame should make.

But such is Love's prevailing Force,
In ev'ry gentle Mind;
It alters all whole Nature's Course,
And rules in ev'ry Kind.
