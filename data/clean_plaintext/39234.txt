O'er Eska's blythe hills, as my lambkins I drove,
I spied a young virgin so gay;
In beauty she rivall'd the goddess of love,
And smil'd like the Queen of the May.

In rapture I ran, and the shepherdess kiss'd,
For who could her glances withstand?
So kindly I woo'd, and my love so confess'd,
That, blushing, she gave me her hand.

Now, blythsome together we tend our few sheep:
No mortals more chearful and bless'd;
Our moments away in soft transports do creep,
And ne'er are with sorrow oppress'd.

O'er mountains and muirlands we wander with joy,
Of heart-vexing cares we ne'er dream;
In singing a song our spare time we employ,
And sporting beside the lov'd stream.

When roaming along, we remark each sweet flow'r;
I ne'er from the virgin dissent:
When weary'd with wand'ring we hie to our bow'r,
And live still in peace and content.

More bliss we enjoy in our cottage alone
Than treasures of gold can devise;
My lot I'd not change for a sceptre or throne,
So much I the shepherdess prize.

At morn when I wake all my fears she dispels,
And makes my heart jocund and light;
She cheers me all day over forests and fells,
And rests in my bosom at night.

The lovely young shepherdess ne'er did aspire
To grandeur, to greatness, or wealth;
The villager, Temp'rance, is known for her sire,
And shepherds have called her HEALTH.
