Hail, deadly Autumn, and thy fading leaf,
I love thee drear and gloomy as thou art:
Not joyful Spring, like thee, can soften grief,
Nor gaudy Summer soothe the aching heart,
But in thy cheerless solitary bower,
Beneath the varied shade, I love to lie,
When dusky Evening's melancholy hour,
With boding clouds, obscures the louring sky,
And tuneless birds and fading flowers appear,
In grief to hang their heads, and mourn the parting year.

'Tis not the gloomy sky, the parting year;
'Tis not the Winter's dreary reign I mourn,
But absent friends &mdash; and one than life more dear,
And joys departed never to return!
O gentle Hope, that 'mid Siberia's snows,
Canst cheer the wretched exile's lingering year,
And where the sun on cursed Oppression glows,
Canst check the sigh, and wipe the falling tear,
Thy gentle care &mdash; thy succour I implore,
O raise thy heavenly voice, and bid me weep no more.

Thou hear'st my prayer &mdash; I feel thy holy flame&mdash;
And future joys in bright succession rise,
And mutual love and friendship &mdash; sacred name!
And home and all the blessings that I prize.
Thou, Memory, lendst thy aid, and to my view
Each friend I love, and every scene most dear,
In forms more bright than ever painter drew,
Fresh from they pencil's magic tint appear.
Roll on, ye lingering hours, that lie between,
'Till Truth shall realize, and Virtue bless the scene.
