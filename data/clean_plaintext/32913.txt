Faire, fairest, faire:  if passing faire, be faire,
Let not your deed's obscure your beauties faire.
The Queene so faire of Fearies not more fayer,
Which doth excell with fancies chiefest fayer,
Fayre to the worldes faire admiring wonder,
Fayrer than JOVES love that kills with thunder.
Ev'n to your swayne you seeme prides passing faire,
That naught desires but fortun's faire to reape,
Yf fortune then will drive me to dispaire,
No change can make your sweetest faire so cheape,
But that I must, and will live in exile,
Before your thoughtes with thought I will defile.
Fayre fierce to faith, when fortune bend her browes,
Yet fortune sweet be thou reclaym'd againe:
For unto thee I offer all my vowes,
That may appease the rigor of my paine:
Yeilde wished hope after this stormie blast,
That calm's repose may worke content at last.
