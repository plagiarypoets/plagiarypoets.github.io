Dear shepherd, I hope you'll excuse
The simple reproof I did give,
And altho' very weak is my Muse,
I'll wear the dear wreath while I live.

Thy friendship!  how sweet the reward,
How soothing that sound is to me!
For surely the musical BARD
Has breathed his soul into thee.

Suspicion's green eye I disdain;
With thee I could pleasantly stray;
We'd mourn the poetical swain,
And pour out our tears on his clay.

How well did young CORYDON know
These virtuous friendships to prize;
Nor car'd he what malice did flow
From their tongues, or from Argus's eyes.

'Tis the virtuous soul I admire,
And none can these feelings reprove;
When free from all earthly desire,
'Tis that alone I call love.

May health and long life crown thy days,
Soft slumbers attend on thy nights:
May thy dreams (sleeping fancy displays)
Be fill'd with unsully'd delights!

Young CORYDON'S friends are so dear,
Oh!  how shall I bid you adieu?
It must be for ever, I fear;
May heav'n be propitious to you!
