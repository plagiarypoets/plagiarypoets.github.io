The wilder'd luxuriance of thorn,
With tendrils of woodbine I blend;
Late ev'ning, or dew-spangled morn,
The task I with pleasure attend;
Here dressing, my Delia, for thee
This arbour, deep hid in the grove;
Come, charmer, and visit with me,
The peaceable mansions of Love.

How often, from walking the dale,
I fly for a silent recess;
And to song give my dolorous tale
Of Love, and its tender excess:
Or, pensive, I ramble the brake,
From all my companions apart;
Whilst, fair as yon swan of the lake,
My Delia prevails in my heart.

My thought ever dwells on thy form,
And my heart lives in constant alarms;
'Tis toss'd, like a wave in the storm,
When Delia flies far from my arms.
Thou, for whom all my songs are in tune,
New songs where thy beauties I trace;
In smiles, like the mornings of June,
Return to thy Colin's embrace.

White clover besprinkles the plain;
In thickets wild roses abound;
The birds in a musical vein
Sing sweet in full chorus around.
Far flown is the Winter's cold hour;
'Tis Summer &mdash; all charming and gay;&mdash;
We safely may sit in the bow'r,
And love the sweet moments away.
