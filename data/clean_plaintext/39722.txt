At the vernal approach of the year,
The birds they delightfully sing;
Nature's flow'rets in graces appear,
And the grottoes with melody ring:
The swain of all cares unpossest,
Views his flocks on their verdant abode;
As he views he seems happily blest,
No cares can his peace incommode.

He rises at dawn of the day,
And carelessly trudges along;
To drive dissipation away,
He whistles, or muses a song:
With joy he his Phillis beholds,
Unaccustom'd to rancour or spite;
To the plains he his feeling unfolds,
In raptures of rural delight.

The emblem of innocent love,
The lambkin alertly displays;
Concordant their murmurs they move,
To nature addresses of praise:
With gayness their pastimes combine,
By the fountains their gambols they play;
Co-mutual their pleasures conjoin,
Sweet pleasures, that brook no allay.

Mankind in expectance pursue
The bubbles of honor and fame,
And eagerly seek to renew,
The shadowy boasts of a name;
Whilst the shepherds and swains of the grove,
In contentment and happiness reign;
Exempt from all passions &mdash; but love,
And nothing their joys to restrain.
