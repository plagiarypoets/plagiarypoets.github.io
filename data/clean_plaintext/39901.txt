GOORGY AND ROBERT.
GOORGY.
Weel meet, good Robert!  saw ye my awd meer?
I've lated her, an hour, i' t' loonin here,
But howsumivver, spite of all my care,
I cannot spy her, nowther heead nor hair!

ROBERT.
Whaw Goorgy, I've te teyl ye dowly news,
Syke as I's varra seer will mak ye muse;
I just this minnit left your poor awd tyke,
Dead as a steean i' Johnny Dobson' dyke.

GOORGY.
Whoor! &mdash; what's that Robert? &mdash; tell us owre ageean,
You're joking &mdash; or you've mebby been misteean;

ROBERT.
Nay, marry, Goorge, I's seer I can't be wrang,
You kno' I've keyn'd aw'd Daisy now se lang.
Her bread-ratch'd feeace, and twa white hinder legs,
Preav'd it was hor, as seer as eggs is eggs.

GOORGY.
Poor thing! &mdash; what deead then &mdash; had she laid there lang?
Whor abouts is she? &mdash; Robert will ye gang?

ROBERT.
I care nut, Goorgy, I hant mich to dea,
A good hour's labour, or mayhappen twea;
Bud as I nivver like to hing behynd,
When I can dea a kaundness tiv a frynd,
An I can help ye, wi my hand or teeam,
I'll help to skin her, or to bring her heeam.

GOORGY.
Thank ye, good Robert! &mdash; I can't think, belike,
How t' poor awd creature's tummled inte t' dike.

ROBERT.
Ye maund, shee'd fun her sen just gaun te dee,
An' sea laid down by t' side (as seeams to me,)
An' when she felt the pains o' death within,
She'd fick'd, an' struggled, an' se towpled in.

GOORGY.
Meast lickly, &mdash; bud &mdash; what was she dead outreet,
When ye furst gat up; when ye gat t' furst seet?

ROBERT.
Youse hear &mdash; As I was gaun down 't looan I spy'd,
A scoore or mair o' Crows by t' gutter side,
All se thrang, hoppin in, an' hoppin out,
I wonder'd what i' th warld they were about.
I leuks, and then I sees an awd yode laid,
Gaspin' an, pantin' there, an' ommost dead;
An' as they pick'd it's een, an' pick'd ageean,
It just cud lift it's leg, and give a greean,
Bud when I fand awd Daisy was their prey,
I wav'd my hat, an' shoo'd 'em all away,
Poor Dais! &mdash; ye maund, she's now woorn fairly out,
She's lang been quite hard sett te trail about.&mdash;
But yonder, Goorgy, loo' ye whoor she's laid,
An' twea 'r three Nanpies chatt'rin' owre her head.

GOORGY.
Aye marry! &mdash; this I nivver wished te see,
She's been se good &mdash; se true a frynd to me.&mdash;
An' is thou cum te this, my poor awd meer?
Thou's been a trusty servant monny a year,
An' better treatment thou's desarv'd fra me,
Than, thus neglected in a dike te dee.&mdash;
Monny a daywark, we ha' wrought togither,
An' bidden monny a blast o' wind and weather;
Monny a lang dree maule, owre moss, an' moor,
An' monny a hill, an' deeal we've travell'd owre;
Bud now &mdash; waes me! &mdash; thou'll nivver trot ne mair,
Te nowther kirk, nor market, spoort, nor fair;
And now, fort' future, thoff I's awd and leam,
I mun be foorc'd te walk, or stay at heam.&mdash;
Ne mair, thou'l bring me cooals fra' Blakay brow,
Or sticks fra' t' wood, or turves fra' Leaf how cow.
My poor awd Dais!  afoor I dig thy greeave,
Thy weel-worn shoon I will for keep-seeakes seeave;
Thy hide, poor lass!  I'll hev it taun'd wi' care,
'Twill mak' a cover to my awd airm chair;
An' pairt, an appron for my wife te weear,
When cardin' woul, or weshin' t' parlour fleer.
Deep i't 'cawd yearth I will thy carcass pleeace,
'At thy poor beeans may lig, and rist i' peeace;
Deep i't 'cawd yearth, 'at dogs may'nt scrat' thee out,
And rauve thy flesh, an' trail thy beeans about.
Thou's been se faithful, for se long to me,
Thou sannut at thy death neglected be.
Seyldom a christian 'at yan now can fynd,
Wad be mair trusty, or mair true a frynd.
