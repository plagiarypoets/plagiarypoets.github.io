Ye Poets why will ye bemoan
For brothers, alas!  who are dead;
Though Shenston, and Cunningham's gone,
Young Hawkins now rears up his head.
A branch he appears from their stem,
And promises blossoms to bear;
Who knows but he'll flourish like them?
Then cease to repine and despair.

His songs they are artless and sweet,
His subjects most innocent are,
Though in all he may not be compleat,
Yet merit he surely must share.
Write on then, thou juvenile bard,
Pursue your lov'd pastoral strain,
For merit I strongly regard,
If my praises are simple and plain.
