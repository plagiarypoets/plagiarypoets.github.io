Blue-eyed Athena!  what a dream wert thou!
Oh!  what a glory hovered o'er thy shrine,&mdash;
Thy hill, where darker error nestles, now!&mdash;
Yet art thou hallowed, though no more divine!
The worship of all noblest hearts is thine,&mdash;
Though the dull Moslem haunts the sacred earth
Where sprung the olive, o'er its bower of vine,
And watched above thine own Cecropia's birth!&mdash;
Truth, that should chase such dreams, were, surely, little worth!

For oh!  thou art the very purest thought
That fable e'er conceiv'd! &mdash; and, on thy hill&mdash;
Thine own blue hill &mdash; where time and Turk have wrought,
In vain, to break the spell that lingers, still,&mdash;
The heart that owns a better faith may kneel,
Nor wrong his creed, while bending o'er the sod
Where gods &mdash; and men like gods, in act and will,&mdash;
Are made immortal, by the wizard rod
Of him whose very thought aspired to be a god!

Mount of the free! &mdash; Olympus of the earth!
Fair as a temple &mdash; lonely as a tomb!
Shall the dark robber rear his household hearth,
Where fabled gods contended for a home!
&mdash;Those bright abstractions of a truth to come!&mdash;
No, by the gift Trazene's monarch gave!
No, by the withered olive's early bloom!&mdash;
The sea-god's offering calls upon thy brave,
Mount, and replant the tree, once more, &mdash; upon the Moslems' grave!
