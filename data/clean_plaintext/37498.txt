Were I a cloud, o'er thee O Keswic-lake!
Oft would I hover on the summer air,
And in thy calmest nook
Reflect my varying form.

Now would I nestle on thy cliffy sides,
Or with yon eagles gage on daring wing
The yet unfathom'd depth
Of ether's shoreless sea;

Now floating low between thy opening hills,
Where many a village still Content has built,
Diffuse my flowing vest
Thy bending banks along;

There when the yellow dawn o'erhangs Lodore,
(Ere yet the Genius of the sounding flood
With yellow glory crowns
The cataract of his pride,)

I'll wring the dew-drops from my golden curls,
Or from my light wings shake bespangled rain,
Thy fields and trembling groves
In livelier green to clothe:

There, when the fading Sun draws near the vale,
From whose blue lap the oozy-pillowed waves
Of sheety Basenthwaite
At hazy distance gleam,

I'll weave the crimson lining of the tent,
Where jealous Evening from the musing eye
Pavilions secretly
His couch of dumb repose.

Were I a mist, I'd arch a dusky vault
Across the pillaring crags of Borro-dale,
And strew with sullen gloom
Its gray fantastic rocks,

Unbeaming thence the sultry noon to him,
Whom virgin-beauty's timid eye pursues
As in the strife of oars
He plies the fervid arm;

Or on the lonely Ness from chilly urn
Pour vapour, and with dewy fingers hang
A dim-depending veil
About its mossy head,

Whence the swart fairies of the mine below
Indignant dash'd the work of Roman pride,
A tower tho' thron'd in heaven
Too weak to awe the land.

Were I a flame-shaft of the northern dawn
On Skiddaw's highth I'd take my glittering stand,
And wreathe with flickering fire
His murky brow sublime,

While Darkness still with her broad mantle wraps
The giant-limbs of his majestic form,
And Silence clasps his foot
Save where hoarse torrents rush.

Thence would I stretch my sword cherubic wide
O'er all thy kindling waters, and expand
A ruby sea of fire
Between thy mountain dun.

Then quench the fervent blushes on thy cheek,
And chace the whitening splendor far away
To sparkle thro' the air
In many a fleecy flake.

Yet wherefore dream?  perchance when life recedes
And woes have rid me of this mortal robe
That tempts my trammel'd step
To droil in earthly care,

The doom-fulfilling Angel shall conduct
My soul to mansions in the airy halls,
Above thy shining floor
That heave their sapphire roofs;

To my delighted spirit shall consign
The rule of every vapour that ascends
Between thy rifted rocks,
Or thro' thy bubbling wave:

Of every breeze that plays along the breast,
Or shakes the pattering foliage of thy trees,
Of every blast that howls
Thy dark-brown hills among,

Then will I pall me in tempestuous gloom;
Athwart thy banks in sevenfold thunders roll,
And heap thy billowing tide,
Black, rough, as lava-fields.

And (when I've learnt to sway destroying storms,
To line the lightning with impurpled flame,
And from unerring hand
To hurl they fiery doom,)

Yon roof, profaner of my realm, assail,
The gathered terrors of this red right arm
Thine isle of rock shall quake,
And every building fall:

The roaring surges from its shore shall dash
The painted tresses of thy harlot-taste;
Thy hall wide-wasting flame
To shapeless ruin sear.

There, (as o'er slaughter-fields the Fiend of war
Broods smiling, while his swollen nostril drinks
The cloud of streaming blood
And agonizing groans,)

Awhile I'll lower o'er the crumbling wrack
Till the gusts slink anew to wombing dens,
The clouds uncurtain heaven,
The murmuring waters hush.

Then shall my satiate ire no more forbid
The tears of twilight on the isle to gleam,
Or rainbow-girded showers
To kiss the flowery shore.

I'll show the Elves where on its scented brink
The purple violets drench their heads in dew,
The dawn-hued primrose blooms,
Or waves the eglantine.

The rifted oak with misletoe shall teem,
The vervain gad along the pathless soil,
And from the mossier walls,
Unfading ivy bow.

From cloudy exile will I then recall
The ghosts of Druids to their ring of stones,
And, when the white-robed choir
Their solemn round renew,

And from their golden harps melodious, pour
Aerial music down the listening vales,
(While thro' the streakless blue
Slow winds the full-orb'd moon,

And all the stars in living radiance bath'd,
Their cluster'd glories o'er the mountains roll,
Surveying in thy flood,
Keswic, their beamy locks,)

The dusky Fays of Borro's echoing cave
From their deep palace by the sound evok'd,
Shall on thy tawny sands
Their jetty tribute fling;

And from the marble grottoes of thy bed,
Shall oft emerge the ladies of the Lake,
To doff upon thy strand
The loose cerulean woof,

To braid with sedge their undulating hair,
In cars of shell to skim thy ruffling wave,
Or its translucent top
With pearly wrist to cleave;

And every Spirit of thy haunted banks,
Of rock, hill, cavern, waterfall, or wood,
Shall hold communion sweet
Around thy hallowed brim.
