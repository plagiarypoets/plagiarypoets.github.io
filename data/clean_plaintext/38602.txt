Hope, thou great solace of the mind,
In all the ills of life's career;
Thro' thee, their weight we bear resign'd,
Thro' thee, we check the falling tear:
Each cloud obscure in brighter tints is dress'd,
And winter's storms more appall the aching breast.

With tatter'd garb, and deep sunk eye,
(Her infants 'wailing at her knee)
See Want beneath a yew-tree lie,
Yet hoping, Heavenly Charity
With some poor mite her lingering hours will bless,
'Till life, pale inanition's fatal pow'rs suppress.

Deep in the dungeon's darksome light,
Some victim to offended Heaven,
Moans thro' his last, and dreadful night,
Almost to desperation driven;
Yet royal mercy beams upon his eye,
And seems to give that life the outraged laws deny.

Arise and walk: &mdash; The Saviour said,
When all around was deep despair&mdash;
The sick had faith &mdash; he took his bed,
And loud Hosannas rent the air.
Thy word alone can this disease controul,
Then grant, O gratious Lord, my faith may make her whole.
