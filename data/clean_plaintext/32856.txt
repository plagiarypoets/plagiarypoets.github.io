Colin I know that, in thy loftie wit
Thou wilt but laugh at these my youthfull lines,
Content I am, they should in silence sit,
Obscured from light, to sing their sad designes:
But that it pleased thy grave shepherdhood,
The Patron of my maiden verse to bee,
When I in doubt of raging Envie stood,
And now I waigh not who shall Chloris see,
For fruit before it comes to full perfection
But blossomes is, as every man doth know:
So these being bloomes, and under thy protection
In time I hope to ripenes more will grow.
And so I leave thee to thy woorthy muse,
Desiring thee all faults heere to excuse.
