DAMON.
When Phillis was faithful and fond &mdash; as she's fair,
A wreath of young roses incircled her hair!
But the willow, sad shepherd, must shadow thy brows,
For Phillis no longer remembers her vows;
To the groves, with fond Colin, the shepherdess flies,
While Damon disturbs the still plains with his sighs.

PHILLIS.
Bethink thee, false Damon, before you upbraid;
When Phoebe's young lambkin had yesterday stray'd,
To the woodlands you wander'd, (poor Phillis forgot)
And drove the gay rambler quite home to her cot;
But a swain so deceitful no damsel can prize!
'Tis Phoebe &mdash; not Phillis &mdash; lays claim to your sighs.

DAMON.
Like summer's gay season, young Phoebe is kind,
And her manners are graceful &mdash; untainted her mind!
Though the sweets of contentment her cottage adorn,
Though she's fresh as the rose-bud &mdash; and fair as the morn,&mdash;
Though she smiles like Pomona &mdash; these smiles I'd resign,
If Phillis were faithful, and deign'd to be mine.

PHILLIS.
On his pipe though young Colin so prettily plays,
Though he sings such sweet sonnets, and writes in my praise;
Though he chose me his truelove last Valentine's day,
When birds sat like bridegrooms all pair'd on the spray;
I could drive the gay shepherd far, far from my mind,
If Damon, the rover, were constant and kind.

DAMON.
Fine folk, my sweet Phillis, may revel and range,
But how fleeting the transport that's founded on change!
In the villager's cottage such happiness springs,
That peasants with pity may look down on Kings!
To the church then let's hasten, our transports to bind,
And Damon will always prove constant and kind.

PHILLIS.
To the church then let's hasten, our transports to bind,
And Phillis will always prove constant and kind.
