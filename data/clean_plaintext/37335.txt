June 10th.  To Fort George, ten miles. &mdash; Walked from Bolton to this place to dinner.  We have now seen the whole of lake George, and its appearance is very uniform, its environs just as nature made them, a beautiful spot for man to cultivate and embellish.  The water of the lake is remarkably clear, and is full of what a young girl would call the "sweetest" little islands; these seem made for the residence of fairies; some of them with only a single tree or shrub upon them, look like a wedding-cake with a sprig of myrtle at the top &mdash; there wants only animation and contrast, houses, gardens and boats, to make an Elysium; these will not be wanting long; cultivation and villages seem to be created with almost magical rapidity.  I tried my hand at verse on this occasion, but the muse was not propitious, and I could produce no more than the following fragment:

Still many an oak its hoary head sustains,
On which a sapling tree the eagle stood,
And saw no tenant of the wild domains,
Save the rough bear or wolf that prowled for food:
No shadow trembled on the limpid flood,
But of the passing cloud, or rolling star,
Or thirsting deer, or darkly waving wood,
And all the sounds which echo roll'd afar,
Were sighs of whispering groves, or ocean's solemn roar.

The banks of the lake from Ti to this place, are almost uninhabited; there is a bad road down the west side, and perhaps a dozen huts in the distance of thirty-six miles; on the east side, nothing but woods and rocks. . . .
