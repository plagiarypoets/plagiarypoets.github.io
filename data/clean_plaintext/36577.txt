In numbers soft and warm, in youthful fire,
The Farmer's Ingle flow'd in Doric strain;
But softer, sweeter far, the magic lyre,
When Nature taught her bairn, on Coila's plain,
To sing the Cottar and his youngling train;
The thrifty mither, garrulous and kind,
The blushing maiden and the bashful swain,
The father's love, with counsel sage combined,
His pray'r and song of praise, and humble, heav'nward mind.

Alas!  the mighty minstrel's tale is tauld;
His warbling lyre hangs silent and unstrung;
Dissolv'd in death, his glowing heart is cauld,
Clos'd his bright e'e, and mute his tuneful tongue,
Whose song of rural bliss symphonious rung.
I fain would touch a sad but kindred string,
And sketch a rural theme as yet unsung,
Though rude the hand that o'er the chords I fling;
But laigh the muse maun flee, with moulted, flutt'ring wing.

The chatt'ring sparrow, hovering in the air,
May imp the woodlark soaring in the sky;
Presumptuous, he the eagle's track may dare,
Although his fate forbids to rise so high;
The tiny wren across the brake may fly,
And, chirping, twitter on the birken spray,
Above the stream that murmurs softly by,
Where Philomela pour'd her melting lay:
We hail the twinkling star, when set the orb of day.

And he whose heart, like mine, delights to rove,
With fond remembrance, o'er the rural scene,
By trotting burnie, down the beechen grove, 
On broom-clad brae, brown heath, or daisied green,
Perhaps in converse with his lovely Jean,
With bright black e'e, and cheek like morning fair,
When busy Memory whispers what has been,
May in my song past joys and sorrows share;
Nor harshly blame the Muse, though long she linger there.

The gloamin' sheens with streaks of gowden light,
Grim Winter's frosty breath forgets to blew,
And lessens daily, to the ploughman's sight
Schihallion's sheeted wreaths of drifted snaw;
The birks are budding bonny in the shaw,
Blithe gowans glinting on the greensward lea,
Glen, bank, an' brae, the primrose busks fu' braw,
And to its bosom wooes the eident bee,
As lightsome Spring returns, to glad the heart and e'e.

The lamb loups lightly on the flow'ry green,
Before the sun has drunk the morning dew;
The laverock carols saftly, though unseen,
Aloft, and lost amidst the ether blue;
The farmer stalks in sheet of snaw-white hue;
Behind him whistles blithe the harrow-boy:
Is there who can the gladsome scene review,
See Nature's smile and Labour's blithe employ,
And still his heart refuse to join the general joy?

Yes; there is one cannot the pleasure share,
Whose plough lies rusting in the stubble field;
Who pines and shivers in the vernal air;
Who once could guide the plough, the sickle wield,
But now he sighs to see his glebe untill'd;
For sickness warns him of approaching doom;
He feels that he must to the conqueror yield:
No more for him Spring sheds her genial bloom,
And Summer suns maun shine above his grassy tomb:

And while he seeks to fix his hopes on high,
With humble heart is to his fate resign'd;
Yet Nature in his bosom prompts the sigh
O'er those he loves, and now maun leave behind;
A thousand anxious thoughts rush o'er his mind;
The husband and the father round his heart
Still closely cling, with tenderest ties entwin'd:
He turns his head to hide the tears that start;
Though not afraid to die, 'tis pain with these to part.

He still could lean upon his daughter's arm,
And she would lead him, at the noon-tide hour,
When April suns were shining saft and warm,
And gently seat him in the woodbine bow'r;
While he would gaze upon this budding flow'r
Then fondly sighing, press her mither's hand,
In silence musing on the tyrant's pow'r,
Whose stroke will snap the dear domestic band,
Whom cunning cannot charm, nor skill, nor power withstand.

'Twas thus, one morn, he thought, and sigh'd, and smil'd,
When clouds were flitting lightly o'er the sun;
He raised his e'e, with look serenely mild,
And said, "I feel my race is nearly run,
Though Nature shrinking, still the stroke would shun,
Would fondly still the parting hour prolong;
Yet Heaven is just &mdash; and let His will be done&mdash;
He will not &mdash; cannot do His creature wrong,
Although I grieve to leave whom I have lov'd so long!

"But now, methinks, 'twere wise to bid farewell,
Ere I am summon'd to my dying bed;
Ere Death, relentless, storm the citadel,
His icy fingers on my bosom spread,
When parch'd my lips &mdash; perhaps my reason fled,
When neighbours throng, and friends stand weeping by,
Or smooth the pillow for my weary head,
Or watch to hear the last expiring sigh
That snaps the filmy thread, and rends the tender tie.

"Yes, I would fain behold each beauteous face,
While yet the tide of life my bosom warms;
My Mary's lip press with a last embrace&mdash;
Again behold my children's growing charms,
And fondly fold them in a father's arms;
And, e'er I writhe beneath the killing dart,
Ere fainting Nature feel its dread alarms,
Would counsel, comfort to you all impart,
Wipe every watery e'e, and soothe each sorrowing heart."

The ev'ning sun hung o'er the mountains hie,
They placed the ploughman in his easy chair;
New lustre lighted up his languid e'e;
His brow, besprent with thin and lyart hair,
Rose full and broad &mdash; betray'd no carking care;
A hectic glow'd upon his wrinkled cheek
So thin, his smile nae langer dimpled there;
The shaded sunbeam, through the misty reek,
Fell saftly on a face serenely mild and meek.

It was a sad and solemn sight, to see
The parting scene of friends so fondly dear;
The father leaning on the mither's knee,
The bairns around in semicircle near;
In every e'e a bright and trembling tear;
And there was one, whom love had hither led,
Nor son, nor brither &mdash; yet no stranger here;
Whose heart with theirs in kindred sorrow bled, 
And long'd to drink the tears the blooming daughter shed.

His glist'ning e'e the auld man slowly rais'd,
While Mary's hand in his was fondly press'd,
On those around in solemn silence gaz'd,
With strong emotion struggling in his breast;
He brush'd a tear that would not be suppress'd,
Look'd round the circle, on each dear loved child,
And calmly thus the mournful throng address'd,
In accents solemn, but benignly mild,
As erst in youthful love he on his Mary smil'd:

"Dear Mary, we have lang and fondly lov'd;
Our wedded life has been a summer day;
Our pleasures many, and, if cares we prov'd,
Yet they, like morning clouds, soon pass'd away;
Then safter seem'd to sheen the sunny ray,
As we have often seen the passing show'r
Refresh the fields, make Nature look more gay,
With richer beauties clothe the blossom'd flow'r,
And sweeter fragrance breathe around our woodbine bow'r.

"We've sailed along a smooth and summer sea,
And seldom thought how rapid was the stream;
Enjoy'd the scene, and talk'd of bliss to be;
And, while we bask'd in Love's meridian beam,
Forgot that we maun meet his parting gleam;
Maun hear the fatal breakers round us roar,
And wauken from our short, but pleasing dream:
That hour is come &mdash; and I maun go before,
To bid my Mary hail!  upon a happier shore.

"Yes, we have seen our sunny moments glide,
While love forbade to tent their rapid flight;
But sublunary bliss will never bide;
The langest, happiest day, maun close in night;
Yet is our gloamin' calm, and cloudless light;
Although the night be lang, the darkness deep,
They are the harbingers of morning bright,
When we shall wauken from our silent sleep,
Where light for ever shines, and love forgets to weep.

"Ye olive plants, which have our union crown'd,
I need not say that all are fondly dear;
Although our parting must your bosoms wound,
Suppress the sigh, and wipe the bootless tear;
But calmly listen with attentive ear:
I would not speak to give your young hearts pain;
Yet, oh!  a father's parting counsels bear,
And Heaven forefend that I should speak in vain!
Still bear them in your plied, still in your heart retain.

"The dawn of Wisdom is, to fear the Lord,
Who marks your goings out and comings in;
And be His grace and guidance still implor'd,
To keep your footsteps from the paths of sin;
For perfect happiness is peace within,
Unknown to those by headlong passions driven;
But, oh!  my bairns, your course betimes begin,
With humble hearts, and pray that grace be given,
Your passions still to rein, and fix your trust in Heaven.

"For, oh!  my children, ever bear in mind
That man is weak, and mortal flesh is frail,
His heart to vice and vanity inclin'd,
And in the world temptations oft assail;
And sometimes o'er the wise resolve prevail,
With him who leans upon his strength alone;
And such, too late, their confidence bewail,
Their heedless folly bitterly bemoan&mdash;
Seed scatter'd to the winds, or on the waters sown!

"Though Pleasure sheds her most seductive charms.
To win the wealthy to her saft embrace,
She can decoy the rustic to her arms,
And lure the peasant onward in the chase,
Who lags at last, still distanced in the race:
Her paths are many, all with snares beset;
New beauties blushing on her changing face;
To ride, shoot, game, drink, swear, and run in debt,
And last, though far from least, is woman's witching net.

"Oh!  then beware of Pleasure's syren smiles,
For they are safter than the summer morn;
Her glamour many a simple heart beguiles;
Soon fade her flow'rs, but sharply stings her thorn;
Lost friends, reproach, disgrace, and public scorn,
And, keener still, the pang of guilt and shame;
Deserted, shunn'd, her victim pines forlorn,
With few to pity, many still to blame,
Health broken, fortune lost, and stain'd a hapless name.

"Let not your hours in idleness be spent,
But never delve in Mammon's miry fen;
With honest industry be aye content,
And always measure to your fellow men
In word and deed as you would wish again:
Indulge not envy, malice, wrath, and strife,
For all are hateful in Omniscient ken;
And if you wish to lead a peaceful life,
Aye shun the gossip thrang, where clash and claiks are rife."

He paused for breath &mdash; his full heart fondly heav'd,
And thus resumed:  "When Rumour tells her tale,
True Charity will aye in heart be griev'd
That Vice and Folly in the world prevail;
But Calumny may Innocence assail,
And foul Reproach may stain a spotless name;
Or, should your neighbour slip, for man is frail,
Oh!  rather blush, than propagate the shame;
No tender heart delights to wound another's fame.

"Let never want, and homeless, helpless age,
Unheeded pour their plaint &mdash; in vain implore;
Some wanderer, in his weary pilgrimage,
Perhaps may leave a blessing at your door;
Alms to the needy will not waste your store,
Nor, want relieved, e'er make your little less:
A feeling heart will make your treasure more;
Whene'er the widow and the orphan bless,
Their pray'rs will mount on hie, pour'd in their deep distress.

"Dear bairns, I leave your mither to your love,
On Heaven and you maun be her stay and trust;
And if you hope a blessing from above,
Be kind to her when I am laid in dust;
The time may come, when age her mind may rust,
Sickness and poverty may her betide.
I see your tears &mdash; they say you will, you must
Be still her friends, in whom she may confide,
That you will sooth her woes, and for her wants provide.

"Nor tongue nor pen can to your minds impart
A father's love, a mither's tender care;
'Tis not in youth to ken a parent's heart,
Or read what Nature's hand has written there;
The hopes and fears that they are doom'd to share,
To nurse the frame, to form the infant mind,
What toils will they endure, what dangers dare!
The sleepless night, with love and care combin'd,
The pang that wrings the heart when children prove unkind!

"And be this truth aye on your minds imprest,
While health and youth within your bosoms glow,
That age will come:  This world is not your rest;
You are but strangers, pilgrims passing through;
Grasp not too fast your dearest bliss below;
For, like the snaw 't will melt within your grip;
Your laughing cup may seem to overflow,
And while you stoop the balmy draught to sip,
The dark decrees of Fate may dash it from your lip.

"Yet life, my bairns, is still a pleasant land,
Has many a joy that man may freely use;
For bounteous Heaven has dealt with liberal hand,
And none but fools the bounty would refuse;
Yet, though the banquet haply seem profuse,
Of some partake, of others scarcely taste;
Aye keep in mind, that they who bliss abuse
Will soonest still their stock of pleasure waste;
The cup that's slowly drain'd leaves aye the richest zest."

Again the peasant paus'd, and fixed his e'e
On him who stood by beauteous Ellen's side;
Then kindly said, "Young man, with joy I see
The mutual love which Nature cannot hide:
Although that bliss must be to me denied,
To see you both before the altar bow,
To see my Ellen blush a blooming bride,
And hear your lips confirm the nuptial vow,
Come, lead her to my arms, and take my blessing now!"

He fondly clasp'd her to his heaving breast,
The gentle pressure made his heart expand;
The maiden's glowing cheek his pale lip press'd;
He raised his e'e, with look benignly bland,
And saw the modest youth before him stand:
With look of love and melting tenderness,
He gently took his daughter's trembling hand,
Placed it in his, "May Heaven unite and blest
Your guileless hearts," he said, "in love and happiness!"

Again he drew his gentle Mary near;
His pale lip quiver'd, dim his watery e'e;
He from her wan cheek kiss'd the trickling tear,
And said, "Dear Mary, cease to weep for me;
Rejoice that soon my spirit shall be free
From all this weary load of cumbering clay;
With resignation bend to Heaven's decree;
I hourly feel my feeble strength decay,
And long to sink asleep, to wake in endless day!"

And now before his feet the children fell;
His hand was laid on every bending head;
He kiss'd and bless'd them all, and bade farewell,
While tears of filial tenderness were shed;
A passing hectic o'er his pale cheek fled,
A clammy sweat stood on his wrinkled face,
Down droop'd his head &mdash; "Oh!  raise me up," he said,
"And leave me not &mdash; a change must soon take place,
Before me shadows swim, and Nature sinks apace!"

The setting sun behind a purple cloud,
Just left a gowden streak along the sky,
Then wrapt him in his brightly-border'd shroud,
Which soon was changed to crimson canopy:
But, hark!  whence comes that groan, that rending sigh?
From one who ne'er shall see the morning dawn,
Whose wildering look is fix'd on vacancy:
Pale falls the moonlight on the dewy lawn;
But paler was that lip, when life's last breath was drawn.

And all is still around the deathful bed;
The struggle's o'er, the conqueror's triumph won;
Lone silence hovers o'er the victim's head;
His clay lies stiff and cold, the spirit flown;
The strong man lies, by greater might undone,
His strength subdued, his dauntless prowess cow'd,
In linen white, by maiden fingers spun;
His bridal-sheet, his aged banes are row'd,
The sheet of nuptial love is his funereal shroud.

To sooth their griefs, this family of love
Seek comfort from the book of sacred lore;
And raise their hearts to Him who sits above,
Who for mankind wrath, shame, and suffering bore,
And now, their Mediator, gone before,
That where He is, there may His servants be,
When this short scene of earthly trial's o'er,
When He who sets from sin and sorrow free,
Shall wipe out every stair, the tear from every e'e.

And now they sing how man is like the grass;
(In Martyrs' sweet but melancholy lays);
As shadows fly, so generations pass;
As falls the fading flow'r, so man decays;
They sing the shortness of our number'd days;
Threescore and ten years our allotted span;
Sing how inscrutable the Almighty's ways,
Too dark and deep for mortal skill to scan;
And deprecate His wrath on weak and erring man.

And now they kneel, in humble, heartfelt prayer,
Before the footstool of the Heav'nly throne;
Their weakness and unworthiness declare,
With thanks for Him who did for guilt atone;
And only in that sacred name alone,
They pray to bear in mind their latter end;
That he would hear and sooth the mourner's moan,
Aye be the widow's and the orphan's friend,
And grant His promis'd grace to guide them to the end.

The gentle Ellen wipes her tearful e'e,
And leads her mother to a widow'd bed,
And whispers comfort &mdash; but it cannot be;
For sleep has from her downy pillow fled,
And sighs are heav'd, and secret tears are shed;
Yet though her heart has never ceased to mourn,
Light dreaming slumbers hover round her head,
Of him for ever from her bosom torn;
She wakes to weep again, forsaken and forlorn.

Another dreary day has ling'ring pass'd;
The sun is sinking in the welkin clear;
The coffin comes &mdash; and she must look her last
On his remains, so long, so fondly dear;
Like wither'd leaf in lap of Autumn sere,
She sees him laid within his narrow cell;
His pale, cauld cheek bedew'd with many a tear,
The parting tribute on his bosom fell&mdash;
She bows her drooping head, and sighs a last farewell!

No sable border'd sheet proclaims the tale,
Twa friends, in black, invite the neighbours round,
Both rich and poor, residing in the vale,
To bear their brother to the hallow'd ground;
And such their love, that none are absent found:
At noon-tide hour, in Sunday's garb they meet,
Or blue, or black, with use and age embrown'd:
A dram does every guest at entrance greet:
Now seated in the barn, they talk, and drink, and eat.

The parish minister, of gentle heart,
Perhaps the widow's lone retreat will seek,
That he may comfort to her mind impart,
And words of heav'nly consolation speak;
Well does he know the human heart is weak,
And well aware that her's is wounded sore:
He kindly frames his words in accents meek,
And guides her view to that celestial shore
"Where death-divided friends shall meet to part no more."

Across the threshold, by his footsteps worn,
Who never more that rustic floor shall tread,
The corpse is softly and in silence borne; 
And now the pall is o'er the coffin spread;
The widow, wailing, as she bears his head;
Her heart is full, and still to Nature true,
Again she clasps the dear departed dead;
Fresh streaming tears the sable pall bedew,
Till kindly led away, she sobs her last adieu.
 
Far down the vale they slowly wind along,
Most part a mournful melancholy train;
Though, haply, some amidst the motley throng
Will introduce discourse ill-timed and vain:
And now the crowd is blackening on the plain,
And pealing slow is heard the funeral bell;
Dim through the trees appears the hallowed fane,
That marks the spot where death and darkness dwell;
And louder on the ear now strikes the solemn knell.

And now, with careful feet they forward pass,
O'er nameless grave, and time-worn, moss-clad stone;
'Midst nettles, hemlock, and the long rank grass,
Which waves o'er many a scatter'd mouldering bone:
Such are the trophies of the tyrant's throne,
Whose subjects sleep in solemn silence round,
Where Love forgets to smile, and Grief to moan;
The rich man's tomb with lying marble crown'd,
The peasant's nameless grave beneath the grassy mound.

Now o'er their heads the broad plane's branches wave,
Obscure the sun, and shed a solemn gloom:
Before them yawns the deep, insatiate grave,
The father's dust dug from its darksome womb;
The sire displaced, to give his children room;
And hence with man the change is never o'er,
In life and death, the cradle and the tomb;
Thus waves behind impel the waves before,
Till all expire in foam, or sleep upon the shore.

With gentle care the coffin'd clay descends;
And saftly rests upon its mouldy bed;
While dust with dust in solemn silence blends,
Each tongue is mute, uncover'd every head;
Still fix'd they stand, and gaze upon the dead:
With all the sexton's skill the grave is dress'd;
A grassy turf with studied care is spread;
The gowan smiles above his clay-cold breast,
And saft the dews of even fall on his bed of rest.

That spot the widow'd mother aft will seek,
On Sundays passing to the house of prayer;
Again the tear steal o'er her wither'd cheek,
As sad she stands, a silent mourner there:
His children, too, will to his grave repair,
And o'er the turf, in filial sorrow sigh:
Haply, some neighbour comes their griefs to share,
Or scan the head-stane with inquiring eye,
And spell the simple lines, that say, "Prepare to die!"

The blazon'd scutcheon and the marble bust
May grace the mighty in the gloomy pile;
A trophied tomb above his titled dust,
In high-plum'd hearse borne to the lonely aisle,
With fulsome epitaph in labour'd style:
But none shall o'er his mouldering ashes weep;
Nor flower nor sunbeam on his grave shall smile,
Nor heir nor widow e'er disturb his sleep;
Forsaken and forgot, in damp and darkness deep.&mdash;
