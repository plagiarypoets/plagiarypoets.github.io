'Tis sweet on Truth's high vantage-ground to stand
And gaze on men below, in mazes lost
Of error; sweet it is to break the wand
Of juggling Comus, battling 'gainst a host
Of frightful passions; or when tempest-tost
To reach, by unexpected chance, the port;
Sweet 'tis to have a Claude though much it cost,
Dear to the honest heart's the rustic's sport;
Sweetest is woman's love when 'tis of good report.

To share each other's joys, to live indeed
In our own little world of happiness:
With interchange of thought as time may need;
To brighten fancy; make our troubles less;
To give and to return the kind caress.
To visit distant realms, not both unknown;
To be each other's help-mates in distress;
To laugh through mutual aid at fortune's frown;
Such were a bliss, indeed, which few can call their own.
