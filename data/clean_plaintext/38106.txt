LUNNY.
What read you, Lightwit? &mdash; Pantomime, no Doubt?

LIGHTWIT.
No, Lunny, guess again; for, there you're out.

LUNNY.
Farce, then?  or Comedy?

LIGHTWIT.
Nor That, nor This;
'Tis TRAGEDY. &mdash; Nay, laugh not; faith, it is!

LUNNY.
Alas!  poor Tragedy! &mdash; Ill-guarded, She,
Finds but Wolf-Shepherds in Thyself and Me!
Search'd, but with Hope to plunder some strong Scene,
And build a bold Burlesque, for Harlequin.

LIGHTWIT.
Aye, truly, You need talk! &mdash; pray, what stole you,
When one Girl staid, and all the Rest withdrew?&mdash;
There needs no Names &mdash; 'twas at a Practice done;
A-ha! &mdash; you're a sly Fellow, master Lunn!

LUNNY.
Done at a Practice? &mdash; You've much Wit to spare;
And learnt to Joke, from brother Jack's WHITE BEAR!

LIGHTWIT.
Malice, (I'm sure) in You, outran your Wit,
When your fine Song against yourself was writ.
Bless its dear Rage!  but that it found this Art,
To ease its Spleen, It must have broke its Heart!

LUNNY.
Why steal you Schemes, you are too dull to act?
But, (justly punish'd for this feeble Fact,)
Your Harlequin, press'd by his Master's Weight,
Breaks his own Neck, in Omen of your Fate.

LIGHTWIT.
At your own Weapons fairly foil'd, the Town
Proclaims my Victory, and votes You down.

LUNNY.
How! &mdash; foil'd by you! &mdash; Spare me That Shame ye Gods!
More than your Match, beyond ev'n Playhouse Odds;
You conquer Lunny! &mdash; You!  nor grave, nor gay,
You, who do Nothing, for the Stage, but pay!
You, who both light and heavy Tumblers find,
To give the World an Emblem of your Mind.

LIGHTWIT.
Come, prove your boasted Skill &mdash; and so will I&mdash;
What Each can do, let present Contest try:
A wager'd Calf, of my Park Cows, I'll stake;
A future Actor, destin'd, long to take;
Treasure as 'tis, Stand This, at Stake for Me:
Now, say, what Pledge supports thy hopeless Plea?

LUNNY.
From the House Stock I dare no Calfskins take,
Actors and Actresses forbid That Stake:
But I'll this DOGSKIN pledge: &mdash; 'twas Work Divine!
How did That happy Transformation shine!
All the full Brute, imbib'd, I thence deriv'd.&mdash;
Long be the Genius bless'd, by which I thriv'd!
Untouch'd, untried by Humane Form, but mine,
This dear, This Sacred Pledge, shall answer Thine.

LIGHTWIT.
An Equal Strainer, I, (in Wit's new Race)
Two Monkeys meaning Skins my Ward-Robe grace,
More wooden followers Orpheus never drew,
Than These fam'd Actors, while the Jest was new!
Yet, take my Calf, take Both my Monkeys Skins;
They shall no more be mine, if Lunny wins.

LUNNY.
Done &mdash; 'tis a Match &mdash; Look yonder, who appears?
A plain, grave, threadbare, Man, who teems in Years,
I knew him (if I err not) in Times past;
But, 'twas not lately that I saw Him, last;
His Name is Common Sense&mdash;

LIGHTWIT.
I've heard it said,
He's a fair Judge &mdash; and, faith, I'm not afraid,
Even to a Stranger, to submit this Claim.&mdash;
Heark'ee, come hither, Mr. &mdash; what's your Name?
Sit down, and hear this Gentleman, and Me,
Cap Merits; and, in whom most Skill you see,
Give Him your casting Vote&mdash;

COMMON SENSE.
I'm no great Wit;
But can guess shrewdly where the Nail is hit:
All things, dispos'd for Liberty, combine;
Come, sit, relax'd, and let free Fancy shine:
Thoughts clouded Sun, with fav'ring Faintness gleams;
And, Sleep-hush'd Meaning in soft Silence, dreams:
Nonsense, awake, mean while, is frank and loud,
And Courts laugh, kindly, with the laughing Crowd:
Wit holds her Peace; &mdash; Opinion makes a Noise,
And a grave Nation maddens into Toys:
Fearless, compare your clashing Crafts, to shun
That Course of Pain, your Father's lov'd to run;
Both your new Rights to Fame, alternate, tell,
The Muses love alternate Ditties well.

LIGHTWIT.
God save His Majesty! &mdash; My Patent springs
From His kind Grant &mdash; and He's the Best of Kings:&mdash;
What, tho' the Town Both Houses ROYAL call,
Mine's the King's Company! &mdash; That's All in All.

LUNNY.
Be you in Title, I in Wit, supreme,
For, Phoebus, mine shines out in Every Scheme.

LIGHTWIT.
Nay, not the Court, alone, rewards my Pains,
Their Laureat aids me with his tuneful Strains.

LUNNY.
Long be That Phoebus yours, so JOVE were mine!
Four Times, of late, (unscorch'd) I've seen Him shine.

LIGHTWIT.
I'm best belov'd; &mdash; My Green-room Virgins strive,
Who most shall please my Taste, with Game alive!
Hid, 'twixt the Scenes, and, by soft Wishes led,
One toss'd a half-gnaw'd Orange, at my Head;
Strait, I look'd back, &mdash; up stairs the Wanton flew,
But staid, till she was sure, I saw who threw.

LUNNY.
Virgins! &mdash; No &mdash; no &mdash; tir'd of that beaten Round,
I've new Pursuits, and nobler Conquests found;
Without their Help, I bring forth Harlequins;
Lay my own Eggs, and hatch 'em, 'twixt the Scenes:
What are Green-Girls, to one whom Pierrot aids,
Apt, as my Dog-skin for the Form, it shades.

LIGHTWIT.
I'm for the Ladies &mdash; and They love Things rare;
I'll learn to build them Owl's-nests in the Air.

LUNNY.
From the wild Growth of my luxuriant Care,
Ten laughing Seasons, have I made Men stare;
Ten laughing Seasons, yet to come, shall rise,
And Thousands, still, stare on &mdash; to spite the Wise.

LIGHTWIT.
Oft have the Muses meant strange Things to say;
Which, with a Breath of mine, were puff'd away.

LUNNY.
How kind my Pierrot, were his Coat not white!
But, ah!  the Rogue won't learn to dress Polite!

LIGHTWIT.
Spare Columbine (dear Town!) for my Defence,
And take, in cheap Exchange, All Shakespear's Sense.

LUNNY.
Ha!  nam'd you Columbine? &mdash; I love Her too;
More, than, even, Men, or Gods, or Lightwits do.
Ah! &mdash; were we doom'd to part &mdash; adieu, she'd cry,
Adieu!  vain World! &mdash; since Lunny's lost, I die.

LIGHTWIT.
Cats scare the Birds; &mdash; ripe Harvest dreads the Rain;
Winds blite the Trees; &mdash; Thin-Boxes give Me Pain.

LUNNY.
Dogs love to bark &mdash; soft-swelling Corn loves Dew;
But, I love Tricks &mdash; Rot Plays, both old, and new.

LIGHTWIT.
When, nobly obstinate, my Actors dare,
With slow, sow'r, Waddle, from the Pit, and stare;
CONVERSING, in Soliloquy, &mdash; to show
How well they reason, and how much they know:
Heavens! &mdash; How the Boxes, long enur'd to bear,
Soft-muttering their Contempt, their Hisses spare!

LUNNY.
Charm'd with Tom Thumb, and conscious of his Cow,
Where once so pleas'd, they'll not be angry, now.
My Boxes, kinder still, applaud, brimful,
Europa, ravish'd by That Rake, her BULL.

LIGHTWIT.
And, you, dear Lords!  who clapp'd my squeaking Pig,
Be bless'd &mdash; and long enjoy my Milkmaid's Jig!

LUNNY.
Who hates not Comedy, with Sense o'ercramm'd,
May He love Tragedy, and, so, be damn'd!

LIGHTWIT.
Where tender Scenes give Virgin Hearts Alarms,
There's Danger &mdash; but Rope-Dangling, safely, charms.

LUNNY.
Keep Guard against the Pain of Thought, ye Fair!
'Twill spoil your Laughter, and begloom your Air.

LIGHTWIT.
I mean, in Time, to wash Blank Verse away;
And (saving Hazard) drown the Name of PLAY.

LUNNY.
I'll get new Dragons, Dancing-Dogs, and Churns,
And swell my Tide of Fortune &mdash; lest it turns.

LIGHTWIT.
My Tumblers, All, grown lean, look tir'd at Length;
They, and their Master, over-work their Strength.

LUNNY.
Psha!  overwork!  no &mdash; no &mdash; That's not the Thing;
I doubt, we're, Both, bewitch'd &mdash; God bless the King.&mdash;

COMMON SENSE.
I've heard your wise Debate; and plainly see,
It's deep Decision is no Task for Me;
While, by such Equal Claims, Each strives to win,
You Both deserve the Dog's and Monkey's, Skin.
