When the fam'd Ruler after God's own heart
Had his full course of days and glory run,
'Twas Heaven's decree the sceptre to impart
Of Israel's chosen race to Solomon:
Call'd from his birth by Him whose word is Truth;
And for his father's sake God lov'd the royal youth.

And think what gift, what blessing thou would'st ask;
But name thy wish, and it is freely thine:&mdash;
My weakness sinks beneath this empire's task;
Birth may give kingdoms, wisdom is divine:
Wisdom to rule I make my sole request;
Be this my only bliss to make my people blest.

'Tis given, He answer'd, what my Son requires;
Thy wish comes after my consenting will:
My influence first gave birth to thy desires;
I dictate the request, and then fulfil.
Here who pursues, already holds the prize;
For Wisdom's greatest part is, wishing to be wise.

And still the fabrick of thy state to raise,
The gifts thy virtue asks not, I bestow:
I crown thee with a length of prosperous days;
Full at thy feet the golden tide shall flow;
O'er the wide world thy empire shall extend;
And with this stedfast earth thy name and glory end.

This scene display'd in Israel's ancient days,
Repeated now with rapture we behold;
A Sovereign young, yet vers'd in Wisdom's ways;
Mature in virtue, and in prudence old;
Peace, he discerns, is the first care of kings,
Tho' every gale that blows bears victory on it's wings.

One only point of difference can be shown,
Which may decide this honourable strife
Between the Jewish Monarch and our own,
Mark'd in the conduct of their private life.
True joys of love none but chaste bosoms  know,
The bliss unlink'd with Shame, and unpursu'd by Woe.
