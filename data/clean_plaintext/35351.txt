In all the luxury of studious ease,
Thus had I past the solitary way;
But when the day was gone, and Twilight pale
O'er Nature's face her veil of dimness threw,
I left to wander thro' the Fields of Taste,
And sate me down to meditate awhile.&mdash;
Inward I turn'd my eyes and all the scenes
That I had seen of wonder and delight
In bright confusion floated thro' my mind.
While thus I mus'd, a spark on Fancy fell,
And kindled instant, in my plastic soul,
The sacred flame of enterprizing zeal
And wild poetic ardour. &mdash; Oh!  what might,
My rapture cried, with such an ample range
Of fair ideas and resplendent forms,
What might not Genius do? &mdash; From such a gay
And rich profusion of ambrosial flow'rs,
Of ev'ry fragrance and of ev'ry hue,
Might not the finger of ingenious Art
A garland weave, whose undecaying wreath
Might bloom immortal round my happy head?&mdash;
From such a various and exhaustless store
Of precious fragments scatter'd all around,
Of gorgeous ORIENTAL colonnades,
Of GOTHIC pillars, and of GRECIAN busts,
Could not judicious Taste a fabric rear,
Sublime and simple &mdash; which at once might brave
The keen researches of the critic eye,
The blast of Envy, and the touch of Time,
And stand the gaze of ev'ry future age?

Scarce had I ended, when the twilight gloom,
That gather'd fast around, was turn'd at once
To more than noon-tide splendor, and a form
Before me sudden stood, like one of those
Resplendent shapes with which Religion, rapt
In holy meditation, loves to cloathe
The pure unbodied energies of Heav'n&mdash;
A sunny radiance brighten'd all his face,
And on his cheek in living lustre glow'd
Unfading beauty and immortal youth:
On ev'ry quick and penetrating glance
That beam'd refulgent from his eagle eye,
Decision hung &mdash; and yet the piercing flame
Was kindly temper'd with a softer ray;
His polish'd brow, where open candor shone,
In turban'd form a silken fillet bound
Of verdant hue, o'er which an ostrich plume
Its graceful length of snowy whiteness wav'd;
Behind, adown his shoulders' easy slope,
The rich luxuriance of his raven hair
In glossy ringlets fell; his mantle, dyed
In all the freshness of ethereal blue,
Around his limbs in careless beauty flow'd,
Display'd his matchless symmetry of shape,
And left each motion free &mdash; each motion too
Was harmony and grace. &mdash; The bright display
Of charms eternal, thus at once reveal'd,
With quick surprize o'erwhelm'd my dazzled sense,
And down I sunk, unable to sustain
The weight of Vision; but the gracious Pow'r
With pity's mild regard my weakness view'd,
And from the ground my fainting courage rais'd;
Then thus he spoke &mdash; but in a voice, whose tones
Had more of melody than e'er was call'd,
In old ARCADIAN times, from lute or harp,
(Or if aught else more tuneable and sweet
Than lute or harp) by touch of mortal hand.

"Why, dearest youth, this useless terror now?
In me thou see'st no formidable shape
Of vengeance or of fear &mdash; but him, to whom
Thou still, unbid, hast willing homage paid&mdash;
The judge of beauty, elegance, and grace,
Both in corporeal and in mental forms&mdash;
The POW'R OF TASTE &mdash; that kind indulgent Pow'r,
That on thy natal hour auspicious smil'd,
And oft enamour'd o'er thy cradle hung;
Ev'n then, beholding with prophetic eye
The future strenth of thy undaunted zeal,
I set thee down, and seal'd thee for my own:
Nor did thy growing years my hope deceive.
Scarce o'er the darkness of thy infant mind
Had Reason's lamp its first faint radiance thrown,
Before, unprompted, thy eccentric soul
Forsook the circle of thy playful mates,
With me to walk thro' solitary groves,
And hear the music of poetic sound.
Ev'n then so pow'rful was the secret charm,
Which to my love thy restless spirit drew,
That oft, regardless of each present good,
It sprung with vain attempt at higher bliss,
And fondly listen'd, with a fruitless ear,
To notes, which then thy unenlighten'd mind
Could only wonder at, and wish to know:
But when advancing time that wish fulfill'd,
And gave at length into thy youthful hand
That magic ring, whose talismanic pow'r
Reveals the meaning of each Muse's tongue,
With what redoubled ardour didst thou then
Frequent the lessons of my tuneful choir!
While those of equal rank and equal age
Pursu'd each phantom of ideal bliss,
With SIREN forms thro' Pleasure's gardens rov'd,
Led up the dance in Fashion's glitt'ring fane,
Or quaff'd with Bacchanals the midnight bowl,
Thy sober feet within the quiet verge
Of my sequester'd haunts were always found;
And now, to crown the whole, thy riper age
Has left the onward path of active life
With me to wander thro' the flow'ry maze,
Where wealth or honour is but rarely found;
For me, thy daring spirit has resign'd,
Each hope that glitters in the vulgar eye,
And brav'd the censures of a slavish world,
At war with all that will not judge like them,
Or seek for happiness beyond the reach
Of Custom's tyrant law. &mdash; And shall the lord
Of all the endless wealth in Fancy's mine
On such unwearied proofs of ardent zeal,
No recompence bestow? &mdash; How justly then
Might ev'ry future age renounce my pow'r,
And cease to worship at my thankless shrine!
But think not thou that merits such as these
Shall meet with no return &mdash; for I have long
A splendid office set apart for thee.
Tho' much of me, my nature, and my laws,
In various notes my tuneful sons have sung,
Not one has yet conceiv'd the bold design
To trace my progress from Creation's birth
Thro' all the changing scenes of place and time,
And lead his free and animated strain,
With equal vigour, thro' the circling maze
Of Manners and of Art. &mdash; For thee alone
Was this great theme reserv'd &mdash; nor shall the talk
Be wholly left to thy unaided pow'r;
For I will dictate to thy list'ning Muse,
And prompt thy spirit with the daring song.
But come with me &mdash; for I will show thee first
The various wonders of my bright domain,
That so the splendid Vision may inflame
With lasting ardour thy enraptur'd soul,
And thaw those frosts of Diffidence and Fear,
That sit so oft around thy pensive heart,
The stream of action stop, and turn away
Th' unsteady current of thy best resolves."

He ceas'd; and snatching quick my trembling hand,
Bore me at once, from out the narrow space
In which I stood, into the ample air,
I know not how &mdash; for all my senses then
In ecstacy were lost &mdash; like him who, rul'd
By some capricious dream's mysterious pow'r,
Incessant hurries on from scene to scene,
Effects of strangest sort astonish'd views,
But leaves both cause and circumstance behind.

Thus was it then with me &mdash; and thus remain'd,
Until at length I found myself again
On solid ground, and constant by my side
The heav'nly Vision stood. &mdash; Before my sight
Appear'd a wall of adamantine rock,
Whose lofty summit, mingling with the clouds,
Ev'n to the fowls of Heav'n access denied.&mdash;
One gate alone, of vast gigantic size,
Whose brilliant structure glitter'd from afar,
Afforded entrance to the scenes within&mdash;
Fast lock'd it seem'd; and as we nearer drew,
I saw the frame itself was neither wrought
Of drudging silver, nor of gaudy gold,
But polish'd ebony, whose sullen hue
To most advantage set the lustre off
Of those symbolic forms, which art divine
Had there pourtray'd with colours brought from Heav'n.
High in the front the Critic balance hung,
While mounted on her rostrum far below
Commanding Eloquence in thunder spoke,
And freely pour'd persuasion's stream along.
On either side a graceful figure shone:
Here History her dread tribunal fill'd,
And call'd to judgment, with an aweful voice,
The trembling ghosts of heroes and of kings;
And there the Pow'r of philosphic lore
Look'd forth from Speculation's airy tow'r,
To mark the manners and the thoughts of men;
And these between were scatter'd all around
The slighter symbols of poetic art&mdash;
The tragic dagger and the comic mask,
The scourge of Satire, Love's bewitching lyre,
The epic trumpet, and the rural reed&mdash;
Each from the rest was parted by a wreath
Of costly gems, which drew in ling'ring maze
Along the sable ground its brilliant trail:
The ruby there with angry blushes glow'd,
Outshone and vanquish'd by the diamond's rays;
While the soft em'rald and the sapphire mild
In mutual smiles their mutual charms admir'd.
Full in the midst an oval space was left,
In which these words of energy and awe
In all the pomp of rising silver shone:

"Hope not to enter here ye impious men,
Who slight the Graces that from Heav'n descend.
Ye cold, unfeeling pedants &mdash; ye who deem
That Love and Friendship are romantic names&mdash;
Ye rude, ye vulgar, and ye hard of heart&mdash;
Ye slaves of Int'rest, and ye votaries
Of Fashion and of Folly &mdash; ye are all
Shut out for ever &mdash; This resplendent gate
Opens to those alone, whose favour'd souls
Are from their birth by Harmony attun'd,
By Feeling soften'd, and by Fancy fir'd."

When now mine eyes had drunk the meaning up
Of these emphatic words, the Pow'r of Taste,
With smiles in which immortal beauty glow'd,
Bespoke me thus again &mdash; "Thou see'st, my son,
From these severe unalterable laws,
By which admission is accorded here,
That far the greater part of human kind
Within these walls must never hope to come;
And many too of those, whose rank might seem
To challenge more respect. &mdash; Here Learning oft,
After a life-time of unwearied pains,
Of studious thought and scientific toil,
Admittance asks in vain. &mdash; Not all the pow'r
Which on her worthless minions Fortune's hand
Has ever lavish'd, were enough to move
This portal from its hinge &mdash; Not all the wealth
By rapine torn from INDIA'S groaning land,
That so, returning home, th' unquiet wretch
May dazzle for a while the thoughtless crowd
With guilty splendor, were a bribe sufficient
To purchase entrance here. &mdash; The pow'rful charm
Of never-failing Beauty here were vain
And vain alike the venerable sound
Of Wisdom's sacred name &mdash; Ev'n Virtue's self,
Tho' sure of entrance at the gate of Heav'n,
Might here apply, and fail to be receiv'd&mdash;
And yet, indulgent to a chosen few,
Who neither beauty, wealth, nor pow'r can boast,
And of those other more substantial gifts
Perhaps inherit but a slender share,
Will this capricious door itself unclose,
When such my will &mdash; as, lo!  it does to thee."

He spoke no dream &mdash; for now th' obedient gate,
Turning on tuneful hinge, its brilliant valves
With courteous invitation open'd wide.
As lightning quick he seiz'd my willing hand,
And led me forward, while the living gate,
Soon as we past, spontaneous shut behind.
