Silence augmenteth Grief,
Writing increaseth Rage,
Stal'd are my Thoughts, which lov'd,
And lost the Wonder of our Age:
Yet quickned now with Fire,
Though dead with Frost e'er now,
Enrag'd I write, I know not what
Dead, quick, I know not how.

Hard-hearted Minds relent
And Rigour's Tears abound,
And Envy strangely rues his end,
In whom no Fault she found;
Knowledg her Light hath lost,
Valour hath slain her Knight,
Sidney is dead, dead is my Friend,
Dead is the World's Delight.

Place pensive wails his Fall,
Whose Presence was her Pride;
Time crieth out, my Ebb is come,
His Life was my Spring-Tide;
Fame mourns, in that she lost
The ground of her Reports;
Each living Wight laments his Lack,
And all in sundry sorts.

He was (wo worth that Word)
To each well thinking Mind
A spotless Friend, a matchless Man,
Whose Vertue ever shin'd;
Declaring in his Thoughts,
His Life, and that he writ,
Highest Conceits, longest Forsights,
And deepest Works of Wit.

He only, like himself,
Was Second unto none;
Whose Death (though Life) we rue, and wrong,
And all in vain do mone
Their Loss; not him wail they,
That fill the World with Cries,
Death slew not him, but he made Death
His Ladder to the Skies.

Now sink of Sorrow I,
Who live, the more the Wrong;
Who wishing Death, whom Death denies,
Whose Thread is all too long;
Who tied to wretched Life,
Who looks for no Relief,
Must spend my ever-dying Days,
In never-ending Grief.

Heart's Ease, and only I,
Live Parallels run on,
Whose equal Length keeps equal Breadth,
And never meet in one;
Yet for not wronging him,
My Thoughts, my Sorrow's Cell,
Shall not run out, though leak they will,
For liking him so well.

Farewel to you my Hopes,
My wonted waking Dreams;
Farewel sometimes enjoyed Joy,
Eclipsed are thy Beams;
Farewel false-pleasing Thoughts,
Which Quietness brings forth;
And farewel Friendship's sacred League,
Uniting Minds of Worth.

And farewel merry Heart,
The Gift of guiltless Minds,
And all Sports, which for Life's restore,
Variety  assigns:
Let all that  sweet is void.
In me no Mirth may dwell;
Philip, the Cause of all this Woe,
My Life's Content, farewel.

Now Rime, the Son of Rage,
Which art no Kin to Skill,
And endless Grief, which deads my Life,
Yet knows not how to kill;
Go seek that hapless Tomb,
Which if thou hap to find,
Salute the Stones that keep the Limbs,
That held so good a Mind.
