The "widow's mite" ascended to the throne,
And brought the blessing of Almighty down.
Think then the comfort the fond soul must find&mdash;
What love and rapture must o'erflow the mind,
Of those who feed the widow and the child,
And pour into the souls the admonition mild.

Thy charms, Benevolence, oh!  who can tell!
They fill the bosom with a magic spell!
The oil of gladness on our heads they pour!
They raise the spirit, as the genial shower
Doth raise the plant borne down by Sol's bright rays,
And tune the heart and thought to the Creator's praise.

Thy 'semblance well the painter hath pourtray'd;
He drew the female, in full charms array'd,
Bending o'er where the widow lay distrest,
Her children's sorrows rankling at her breast;
Thou gave relief, and from the troubled heart
Drove care and wo, and bade all anguish quick depart.
