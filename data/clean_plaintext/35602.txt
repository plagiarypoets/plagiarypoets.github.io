Ye blest memorials of a parent's worth,
Whose gentle spirit though in glory shrined,
Even now perchance regards this grovelling earth,
And regulates, unseen, this wayward mind.
O, where a worthy offering may I find,
For that beningnant hand, whose friendly zeal,
Such dear deposits to my care consigned&mdash;
Or how the sense of gratitude reveal?
To meet the strong emotion that I feel,
For power of language I but vainly seek;
Vainly before the Muse's altar kneel,
Who owns her choicest energies are weak,
To point a grief and joy, that high excess,
Which tears and silence can alone express.
