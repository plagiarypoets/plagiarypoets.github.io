Build up, O England!  Statuaes, Arches BOWES,
And Tombes, and Pillars, to his living fame,
Who was the wisdome of the valiant BOWES,
And solide honour, of that ancient name.
And you white Swannes, of Thames, and Tweide, proclame
Your grievous losses, and his high desert,
Who both his courses, and his cares did frame,
All dangers from your bankes aye to divert.
He lov'd his Queene, and crowne, with upright heart:
Postponing private wealth, to publicke weale:
He all his thoughts, and counsels did convert:
To peace for CHURCH, and for the STATE with zeale.
And now at last, hath pearst the heavens a-laft,
Whose bodie was the BOWE, and Soule the SHAFT.

The Raine-Bowes now of peace, are cloudes un-cleare:
And Concordes mouth, now speachless lyes alace,
Yea Englands MERCURE, passing MERCURES sphaere,
By grace hath gone, to the EMPERIALL place.
Whre neither bounds, nor limits, endes, nor space,
Nor was, nor shall, nor time to come, or past:
But all in presence are, before his face:
Who was the MAKER first, and MOVER last.
Why then should I, such projects seeme to cast?
To make him famous, who is elles divine.
(Whose soule with heavenly MANNA is repast,
To whom the Lord, doth lasting crownes propine.)
Or yet him offer?  which he doth not crave,
In making TEARES his TOMBE, and GRIEFS his GRAVE.
