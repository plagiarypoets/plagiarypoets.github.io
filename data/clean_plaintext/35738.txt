Here, in a gloomy grove, some little space,
From this fair castle, by a streamlet's side,
Where waving pines still sound a sullen base,
And water murmurs, as it down doth glide,
A goodly chapel there was edified.
Thither to wend, full many a sonne did use,
Them good man sexton, who doth there abide,
When in they entered been, eftsoons immews,
Silent, in very dark, and well y-cushioned pews.

Then chaplain sleek, up to his pulpit creeps,
A fat round body, and broad face he had,
(He many feasts, I wis, but few fasts keeps,)
Yet of his cheer, he seemed too solemn sad.
He was, in sooth, a drowsy stupid lad,
The rewdest ass, our castle's crew among,
He prankt his band, and then the people bade
Praisen the lord, by singing holy song,
So clerk it raised high, now sing it all the throng.

When this had tuned them to sweet repose,
Sir Sanctity gan preche of . . . reprobation.
He spake of mystic grace, which straungely flows,
On wight unworthy of justification,
Much hath he talked, and of predestination;
Still he repeteth what he said afore,
And still he crieth out . . . regeneration.
And still he coughs, and spitteth on the flore,
And every sentence hems, both after and afore.

As in some wealthy yeoman's well-stored yard,
Where fowl of every various kind abound,
The gaudy peacock for his plumage spar'd,
The valiant cock whose voice doth early sound;
The careful hen with ducklings all around,
The strutting turkey, and the meek-eyed dove.
At even tide, perchance a flock is found,
Of simple geese, sound sleeping, while above,
Waketh one cackling goose . . . thus slept we in that grove.
