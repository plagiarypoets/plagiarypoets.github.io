R  ivers be silent, peace you muses nine,
O  rpheus be dumbe, for now no praise is thine;
B  end all your eares unto Britannia's peere,
E  ver be praising, nere to praise him feare;
R  ight as the painters garnish with theire sable
T  heir brighter colours in a curious table.
T  ime so will place thee in the shield of fame,
A  s chiefe of men t' immortalize thy name;
Y  et why should I with rude rimes seeke to raise thee,
L  et every sonnet in th' pastorals praise thee;
O  dasht Apollo, hide thy face for shame,
R  ender to shepheards henceforth all the fame.
