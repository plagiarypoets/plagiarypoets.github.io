Beside a sloping hill, and shady grove,
Where chrystal streams in soft meanders flow,
Where jovial huntsmen through the forest rove,
And herbs and plants in wild profusion grow:
Here on the margin of a tow'ring wood,
Betwixt the mountain and the verdant green,
A humble cot, and lowly hovel stood,
With stone pig-stye and hen-roost plac'd within.
Kennel, Kitchen, &amp;c., closed the brilliant scene.

On beams of fir the rural mansion rose,
With thatch of straw for covering strow'd aloof,
The humble earth serv'd all for their repose,
And spread in verdure far beneath the roof.
Here in the close of each succeeding day,
The different tribes with equal zeal repair,
The worthy sire his household calls to pray,
And far way expels each trifling care;
Pigs, dugs, cows, hens and boys, all join in social pray'r.

The service ended, and their pray'rs all said,
With one consent the family retires,
Each makes the earth his pillow and his bed,
And deep in midnight melody respires:
The pensive swine that groan beneath their yokes,
In lofty strains reverberate the skies;
The sleepless nymph, her absent swain invokes,
The screaming infant joins his warbling cries;
Owls hoot, dogs growl, boys snore, and mew the cat replies.

The morn succeeds the music of the night,
Shrill Chanticleer salutes the new born day;
The bonny milk-maid rises with the light,
Her work to close, and after noon to play;
The gen'rous dog obsequious to her will,
To wash the pot with ardent zeal prepares;
Applies his tongue with all his wonted skill,
And in he tumbles, over head and ears;
Spot yells, cat squalls, man scolds, and modest Jenny swears.

Next comes the dance and music of the spheres,
With lusty lads and lasses by their side,
Each ragged boy and tatter'd girl appears,
That scarce conceal what nature taught to hide;
The hungry swine harmonious treble squeals,
And shows his height of voice by length of face,
The squalling females join in thund'ring peals,
With all the clamor of the canine race;
While owls, and frogs, and crows, in concert blow the bass.

Such brilliant scenes poetic fancy forms,
Where West-Point mountain's lofty summit rise,
And stand secure amidst the approaching storms,
And dare the mutt'ring thunder from the skies.
Where learning meets a patron in each scrub;
Were genius plucks the laurel wreath of praise;
Where ev'ry soul, from highlife down to grub,
Are first rate politicians now a days,
And swear, and fight, and drink, and vote with noes and ayes.
