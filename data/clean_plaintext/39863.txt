Here, in this waving, solitary shade,
Where Flora's fragrant bloom around is spread,
In fairest splendours of the night display'd,
When liquid dews a silver lustre shed,
And every flow'ret by their balm is fed,
Calm Solitude may find a pleasing seat,
And muse on rosy joys for ever fled;
And on those fleeting dreams of rapture sweet,
Which spread delusive paths before our wand'ring feet.

May I wild stray far from the giddy world,
Through scenes where Nature's lovely beauties shine,
And gaze on Night's star-spangled plume unfurl'd,
Displaying soft refulgent line divine;
And when the moon-beams one the waves recline,
Sleeping calmly beneath their glancing ray,
Then in a bower where blooms the weeping vine,
How sweet to rest, and view the glistening spray.
In sparkling glow, deep-tinted azure, mild display.

I love by Ocean's lonely shores to glide;
To hear shrill blasts of deep winds howling by,
To see the swan on waves majestic ride,
And listen to the owlet's plaintive cry;
Or o'er the deep to view the curlew fly
On wings of white unto her cliff-built nest;
And by the mountain where dark shadows lie,
I love to roam, and lay me down to rest,
On beds with dewy, crimson, primrose flow'rets drest.
