Beneath the shelter of a mighty hill,
Whose marble peaks were garlanded with vine,
And musical with many a sunny rill,
That through its purple-clustered shades did twine,
Bright on a summer serpent's golden spine,
Leaned a low temple, in the sweet, grey gloom,
Hoary with moss, like Age in calm decline.
With, here and there, a rose's lingering bloom,
Wreathed loving round its brow &mdash; that temple is a tomb!

There sleeps the Mantuan!  There the subtlest hand
That ever wakened passion's lyre, is laid.
Oh!  Master-genius of thy glorious Land!
When &mdash; when shall Italy her tresses braid
With the bright flowers, that round thy forehead played?
When flash to Heaven the ancient sword of Rome?
Come from thy rest, and call her Mighty shade!
No!  Vice, the worm, has fed upon her bloom!
Look not upon the slave; Sleep, Virgil, in thy tomb!
