Thy real friends, O Liberty!
Must gaze on France with ecstacy,
Must hold that day for ever dear
Which clos'd a despot's proud career,
Must venerate the wondrous deed
Which millions from their shackles freed&mdash;
Which shews the world's anointed things,
How puny, when oppos'd, are kings,
And which, in terms all powerful, bids mankind,
Burst their degrading chains, and be what heaven design'd.

Yes!  Liberty, thy friends sincere
Must Gallia's dauntless sons revere,
And tho' a vain, a worthless crew,
With tythe and benefice in view,
Should far and wide their slanders fling
And raise the cry of "Church and king,"
Tho' chapels blaze, tho' mansions fall,
And one vast ruin frown on all;
Yet undismay'd, they still defend thy cause,
Still brand the tyrant's sway, and Britain's partial laws.

Let the infuriate rabble rise
And awful flames illume the skies;
Let priests exultant eye the blaze,
Then to the mob deal pence and praise&mdash;
Let magistrates, with snail-like haste
Attempt to stay th' infernal waste?
Let pious &mdash; such deeds to check,
From justice screen the ruffians neck;
Such wrongs as these but sprinkle Freedom's fire,
And speed that grand reform, which patriots' souls desire!
