Eternal Spirit!  mightiest though unknown,
Yet seen and felt o'er all the breathing earth;
From the dark thunder of thy cloudy throne,
To the young zephyr in its hour of birth!
Thou smil'st, &mdash; the universe is full of mirth,
And nature wantons in those moments bright:
Thou frown'st, &mdash; and darkness walks sublimely forth:
Thou spread'st abroad thy wings, and solemn night
Swathes round a million suns, that trembling hide their light!

Unsearchable &mdash; unalterable thy ways!
The immortal soul but sees of thee a part:
No one can tell thy awful length of days,
Nor dream of thy departure! &mdash; no:  thou wert
Before the worlds were fashion'd, and thou art
The same to-day as yesterday; on thee,
Time and decay can leave no stain; thy heart
Departs not with the pigmy worlds we see,
They drop in dust away &mdash; but thou remainest free!

Bestriding space! &mdash; in darkness thou dost stand
In solitary might, holding the spheres
Within the hollow of thy dreadful hand;
The lightning gems thine awful brow, nor sears:
Eternity rolls round thee, but his years
Can leave no blight upon thy glorious form,
The blast that through infinitude careers
The comets spring, launch'd from thy mighty arm,
Whilst thou, in glory walks calm o'er the thunder storm!

Unchanged for ever thou hast been, and still
Unsullied &mdash; and unchanged will brightly be;
The million, million worlds, but only fill
A little speck of thy immensity!
Oh!  still this erring world is loved by thee&mdash;
Ancient of Days, thy wings are stretch'd as bright
As when thy spirit, on Time's jubilee,
Dovelike descended from thy holy height,
And said to light &mdash; Arise!  and there was life and light.
