What Shepherd so sweetly complains,
In ditties so mournful and kind?
Sure Corydon gladdens the plains,
And murmurs his woes in the wind;
Releas'd from the mansions of death,
In pity to Woodhouse's grief,
Once more he makes use of his breath,
To grant him a sigh, or relief.

Sweet fancy continue the dream,
And let me not lose him again,
O my heart how delightful the theme
To imagine it Corydon's strain;
But, alas, busy thought pushes on,
And bids the delusions depart,
It tells me for ever he's gone,
And grief again strikes thro' my heart.

Yet still there's some comfort remains;
Whoever was Corydon's friend,
Ye Lovers, ye Nymphs, and fond Swains,
To the Shepherd's last will now attend:
When death grimly stalk'd o'er the field
And ended his exquisite song,
The Dryads assistance to yield
Around their dear favourite throng:

They cull'd from the stores of the woods
Each herb for its virtue renown'd,
The Naiads too gave from their floods
Each water that wholesome was found;
When Corydon rear'd up his shead,
And cry'd ye kind Nymphs 'tis in vain,
I soon shall be told with the dead,
No balsam can lessen my pain;

Then tell my last words to the Swains,
When they miss me their pastimes among,
A Corydon to them remains
Well skill'd in the carrol and song,
'Tis PORTAL, go bear him this reed,
No voice can his sonnet exceed
When prompted by friendship and love.
