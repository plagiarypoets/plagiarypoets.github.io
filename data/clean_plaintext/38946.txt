When daisies enamel the fields,
And jessamine sweetens the bow'rs,
When Nature's rich treasure she yields,
And strews ev'ry valley with flowers.

When trickling fast down from the rock,
The clear rivulet murmurs along,
The shepherd pipes sweet to his flock,
And the wood-lark soft carols his song.

Delighted I range o'er the hills,
Or I wander at noon in the grove,
Or list to the purling of rills,
Or I sing of the maid that I love.

I sing of her beauties, her grace,
That she's gentle, engaging and kind,
I boast that the charms of her face,
Are exceeded by those of her mind.

Then fondly I haste to her cot,
Where I sit myself down by her side,
Contented and pleased with my lot,
How I laugh at wealth, grandeur, and pride.
