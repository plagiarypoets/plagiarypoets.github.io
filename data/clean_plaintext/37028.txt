MORN.
Lo!  Morning wakes upon the gray hill's brow,
Raising the veil of mist, meek twilight wore;&mdash;
And hark!  resounding from the tamarind bough
The Minah's matins ring!  On Ganga's shore
The fervent Hindoos welcome and adore
The rising Lord of Day.  Above the vale
Behold the tall Palmyra proudly soar,
And wave his verdant crown, &mdash; a lustre pale
Gleams on the broad fringed leaves, that rustle in the gale!

NOON.
How still the noon-tide hour!  no sounds arise
To cheer the sultry calm, &mdash; deep silence reigns
Among the drooping groves; the fervid skies
Glare on the slumbering wave; on those far plains
The zephyr dies, &mdash; no hope of rest detains
The pilgrim there!  Yon Orb's meridian might
No fragrant bower, no humid cloud restrains,&mdash;
The solar rays, insufferably bright,
Play on the fevered brow, and mock the dazzled sight!

NIGHT.
Oh!  how the spirit joys, when the fresh breeze,
The milder radiance, and the longer shade,
Steal o'er the sultry scene!  Through waving trees
The pale moon smiles, the minstrels of the glade
Hail night's fair Queen; and as the day-beams fade
Along the crimson west, through twilight gloom
The fire-fly darts; and, where all lowly laid
The dead repose, the mourner's hands illume
The consecrated lamp o'er beauty's hallowed tomb!
