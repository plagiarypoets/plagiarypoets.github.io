Hail, wayward Winter!  child of snow,
I see thee mount thine icy throne,
I see thee spread thy scenes of woe
To yon poor moonless wanderer lone.
On the wild waste he feels thy power,
Thy biting blast, thy sleety shower,
Resolved by night no more to roam
Far from his faithful friends, and hospitable home.

Though now the vermil-tinctured lip
Of frolick Spring, with roses crowned,
No more the ambrosial dew can sip,
Or kiss the flowers that paint the ground;
Though fair Hyperion's brilliant beam
Assail in vain the impassive stream,
And keen is felt thy frosty sting,
I woo thee, Winter wild, nor heed thy watry wing.

The bard's rapt eye no longer views
The fairy elves in noon of night,
In circles deftly skim the dews,
Nor fly the leafy lawn till light,
When they with twinkling feet advance
To thrid the mazes of the dance,
And o'er his frenzied sense diffuse
Bland visions, light as air, and spotless as the Muse.

The azure violet on the shore,
Fair rival of the ruddy rose,
Spreads its blue foliage no more,
Entombed beneath a waste of snows.
The gay-plumed songsters of the grove
No longer carol tales of love,
But Nature, through her empire's bound,
Hears nought but horrid hail, and threatening tempests sound.

But though thy spells, relentless power,
The world in frosty fetters bind;
Though, arm'd with snow, and ice, and shower,
Thou shedd'st thy wrath on all mankind,
Yet I thy ruffian rage defy,
Thy storm-tongued voice, thy lowering eye,
While hous'd, and round the social fire,
I hear thy menace loud, and unavailing ire.

Dauntless I brave thy boisterous breath,
Whene'er the lettered circle meet,
Nor dread to tempt at daylight's death,
The dangers of the slippery street.
This eve with choicest friends I pass,
Nor churlish shun the electrick glass,
Iberia's fragrant tube illume,
Nor dread thy thunders, Winter, though they shake the room.
