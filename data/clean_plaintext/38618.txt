Since JOCKEY of late is so kind,
My poor panting heart is at rest.
Such peace and contentment I find,
No maiden's so happy and blest.
For sweetly my days pass away,
With joy I attend on my sheep;
And though they should happen to stray,
I'll never once offer to weep.

Such bliss do I find from my swain,
For he is so bonny and gay;
And meets me each night on the plain,
And calls me the flower of MAY.
He took me last week to the fair,
And gave me a top-knot beside,
Then kiss'd me, and call'd me his care,
And vow'd that I should be his bride.

Then tell me, ye maidens, I pray,
How can I my JOCKEY deny,
Who chearfully sings thro' the day,
And charms me whenever he's nigh.
On the banks of the soft flowing TWEED,
Whenever we happen to meet,
So pleasing he plays on his reed&mdash;
No shepherd like JOCKEY'S so sweet.
