While the torn vessel stems her lab'ring way,
Ere yon blue hills sink ever from my view;
Let me to sorrow raise the tribute lay;
And take of them my long, my last adieu.

Adieu!  ye walls; thou fatal stream farewel;
By war's sad chance beneath whose muddy wave
Full many a gallant youth untimely fell,
Full many a Britain found an early grave.

Beneath thy tide, ah!  silent now they roll,
Or strew with mangled limbs thy sandy shore;
The trumpet's call no more awakes their soul!
The battle's voice they now shall hear no more.

In vain the constant wife and feeble sire,
Expectant wish their lov'd return to see;
In vain their infants' lisping tongues enquire,
And wait the story on their father's knee.

Ah!  nought avails their anxious, busy care;
Far, far, they lie, on hostile seas they fell;
The wife's, sire's, infant's joy no more to share,
The tale of glorious deeds no more to tell.

Learn then, ye Fair, for others woes to feel,
Let the soft tears bedew the sparkling eye;
When the brave perish for their country's weal,
'Tis pitys debt to heave the heartfelt sigh.

Ah!  glorious DRAKE!  far other lot was thine,
Fate gave to thee to quell the hostile pride;
To seize the treasures of POTOSI'S mine,
And sail triumphant o'er LA PLATA'S tide.

But Providence, on secret wonders bent,
Conceals its purposes from mortal view;
And Heaven, no doubt with some allwise intent,
Deny'd to numbers what it gave to few.
