Tyrants, and blood-stain'd conquerors may thrive,
While Truth and Virtue suffer on the Wheel;
True Worth and simple Honesty may strive,
And seem to strive in vain &mdash; while villains feel
Dame Fortune's smile &mdash; Morality may reel,
While Atheists laugh in front of mighty Heaven:&mdash;
Bigots and Despots may be cloth'd in steel
Whilst Faith by Superstition's sword is riven:
Power may oppress and pray to be forgiven,
While Poverty, despairing, weeps for food:&mdash;
Statesmen may call Destruction's pathway even,&mdash;
Zealots preach Grace, themselves averse to good;&mdash;
Yet, on the great, the awful Judgment Day!
Virtue shall smile, while Vice is cast away.
