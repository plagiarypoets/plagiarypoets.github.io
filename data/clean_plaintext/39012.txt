COLIN.
Good morning, Keatie &mdash; Fie, for shame,
To sleep sae lang ye're sair to blame:
Then at your glass to smile an' smirk,
An' be the hindmost at the kirk!

KATE.
Ay, 'tis o'er true &mdash; O, wae's my heart!
An' to reprove is weel your part;
Your neighbours o' their faults to tell,
When ye're sae early there yoursell!

COLIN.
Ah, cunning Kate!  I ken your way,
An' darena wrangle w' ye the day;
For ye're sae tart when ye begin,
Ye lead ane into words o' sin.
An' now, when we hae met thegither,
An' like sae weel to be wi' ither,
Let's chat, without a' taunts or scorning,
O' things befitting Sabbath morning.
I am o'er late, an' sair to blame&mdash;
But, O, I've sic a charge at hame!

KATE.
Nae doubt, nae doubt!  'Tis a' o'er true,&mdash;
Naebody else has aught to do;
Ilk turn to Colin's hand maun lie,
The lasses a' to court forbye!

COLIN.
Now, Kate, I canna stand sic joking,
There's nought on earth is sae provoking;
When weel ye ken I never parl
Either to kiss, or court, or quarrel,
Or sit me down to mince or mell
Wi' ony lass except yoursell.

KATE.
Alas!  poor lad, ye're sair abused then,
An' fausely, wickedly accused then;
Sic tales are through the country fleeing!&mdash;
But then the country's ill for leeing.
It wasna true that Meg M'Gill
Cam greeting to you on the hill?
I heard sic story, an' the cause o't.
It wasna true; &mdash; I'm sure it was not?

COLIN.
'Tis hard on twall.  Good morning, Kate;
I hate at preachings to be late;
Besides, it's sinfu' to get mad
At sic a glib-tongued wicked jade.

KATE.
Colin, I'll gang as fast as you
On this fine day, and faster too;
Besides, I'll chat of what you will,
The Bible, or the Papish bill;
The statutes of the ancient law,
Or beauties of Queen Bathsheba.
Now, tell me, Colin, on your life,
What think you o' that winsome wife?

COLIN.
Kate, ye're a witch &mdash; sae haud your tongue;
An elf sae wicked, yet sae young,
Was never nursed on mother's knee&mdash;
What are Bathsheba's faults to me?

KATE.
O, nought to you!  Wha said they were?
I only wanted to prefer
Some Scripture argument 'bout sin,
And chanced with woman to begin.
But, Colin, 'tis right strange o' you,
Yet I hae noted, an 'tis true,
Whene'er o' womankind I hint,
Then up you flee like fire frae flint,&mdash;
Frae whilk it weel might understood be,
That things are no just as they should be.

C0LIN.
Sweet Kate!  wi' that provokin' tongue
My heart wi' rage is aften wrung,
But when I turn me round, an' see
The wily twinkle o' your ee,
The cherry cheek an' dimpled chin,
My heart-strings dirl my breast within.
Kate, I suspect, that, chance what may,
We'll hardly reach the kirk the day;
We wad be blamed by matrons dour,
Gaun in at sic a daftlike hour,
An' some auld maids I ken beside
Wad cast us looks we coudna bide.
Let's turn, an' up beneath the heuch
O' the wild glen o' Gilmanscleuch;
We'll spend, in nature's green alcove,
The day in pure delights of love;
Read on our Bibles, pray bedeen,
An' maybe steal a kiss between.
If there's a blink o' heavenly bliss
On human nature, it is this.

KATE.
Weel, Colin, I shall not gainsay,
A wilfu' man maun hae his way;
Since ye propose't, an' think nae shame,
If 'tis a sin, ye'll bear the blame.
But tell me this &mdash; though gay an' braw,
War ye gaun to the kirk ava?

COLIN.
Whisht, Kate!  an' speer nae that again,&mdash;
There's maybe mae to blame than ane;
There are some things 'tween man and maid
Mair natural to be thought than said;
But now, our resting-place is here,
Come to my side, my comely dear,
Close to my side, nor ance avert
The vision dearest to my heart.
Look round you, Kate; the scene you see
Is wild as mountain scene can be;
Here sit we in a hollow swarth,
Scoop'd from the bosom o' the earth;
Our palace-wall the shaggy fell;
Our couch of state the heather-bell;
The sounding rivulet, combined
With music of the mountain wind,
The only anthem which we list;
Our canopy the yielding mist;
Yet here, within our desert den,
Far frae the walks and eyes of men,
Think o' our heavenly Maker's kindness,
For a' our sins an' mortal blindness.
Beyond the bliss o' kingly bowers
An earthly happiness is ours.

O, Keatie, when this scene I spy,
Imbedded in thy deep blue eye
Like a wee vision o' the mind,
A dream of heaven an' earth combined,
My ardent soul is all on flame
With a delight that wants a name&mdash;
A flame so holy an' divine,
An angel's heart might envy mine.
My own rapt image, too, I see,
As if I stood 'twixt heaven and thee&mdash;
Forbid it, a' ye powers above!
An' O, forgie this tear o' love;
For ne'er was vision so complete
In window of a soul so sweet.

KATE.
Colin, I like nae sic pathetics;
When chaps get into their poetics,
They rave on like the winter winds,
An' mischief whiles comes in their minds:
Sae, that I still may haud you dear,
An' keep you sober and sincere,
Kneel down upon that purple lea,
An' pray to God for you an' me&mdash;
The path o' grace has a beginning,
An' praying winna gang wi' sinning;
'Tis sweet an' comely to express
Our homage in the wilderness,
An' train our youthfu' minds away
Frae courting on the Sabbath day.

Colin, without another word,
Kneel'd down upon the lonely sward,
His comely face turn'd to the sky,
With ardour in his dark blue eye;
And thus unto his God he pray'd,
As near as't can in rhyme be said:

C0LIN.
O thou, who dwell'st beyond yon sun!
Where the sinful soul can never won;
Thou God of all beings on earth that dwell,
The angels of heaven, an' spirits of hell&mdash;
O!  wilt thou deign, in thy love divine,
To list to such a prayer as mine?
Not for myself do I crave thine ear,
But for one beside, than life more dear;
And for her sake I heard shall be,
For a virgin's soul is dear to thee.

Then thou, who reared'st you ample sky,
And planted the Paradise on high,
When the morning stars together sung,
And its arch with hymns of angels rung;
Who placed the sun on his golden throne,
His God's vicegerent, and His alone;
Who clothed the moon in her silver veil,
And the little stars in their diamond mail;
Who wall'd the ocean's mighty wave,
O'er coral beds to roll and rave;
And form'd these mountains, great and small,
And the soul of man, the last of all&mdash;
O, hear in heaven, most graciously,
For we had our lives and souls from thee!

O thou, who laid'st thine infant head
In a manger for thy cradle bed,
When the spirits of guilt were moved with awe,
And the angels marvell'd at what they saw&mdash;
The babe of heaven hush'd to his rest
Upon an earthly virgin's breast,
Then yield his life upon the tree,
And lie in the grave for such as me&mdash;
O hear us in heaven, thou holy one!
For in thy merits we trust alone!
Thou spirit of grace, adored, believed,
Great messenger all unconceived;
Thou THREE in ONE, and ONE in THREE,
Potent, supreme Divinity,
As one great God we worship thee
Then hear our prayers whilst here we live,
And when thou hearest, Lord forgive!

We have no earthly thing to crave;
We are more than happy with what we have:&mdash;
We have youth and health, and love beside,
And thee for our father and our guide;
Thy own blue heavens smiling o'er us;
Religion, hope, and the world before us;
And all we can do, is to express
Our gratitude and our thankfulness.

One blessing would earthly hope fulfil,
If 'tis accordant with thy will:&mdash;
May we two, kneeling thee before,
Be join'd as one for evermore!
And that a prospect may remain
Of acting earthly scenes again,
May she be as a fruitful vine&mdash;

KATE.
Stop, Colin, stop!  I canna join!
Ye may pray for marriage gin ye will,
To think of that can do nae ill;
Its sinless joys our God will grant them&mdash;
We'll pray for bairnies when we want them.
Ye cou'dna ask for aught that's worse,
Than the heaviest portion o' woman's curse.

COLIN.
Ah, my dear Kate!  gin ye be spared,
You'll change your chime on that award.
If pure affection's from above,
If "love is heaven, and heaven is love,"
If loveliness conceived may be,
Can ye a sight so lovely see,
As a young comely mother's rest,
With sweet babe to her bosom press'd;
Its round and chubby cheek laid low,
Misshapen on her breast of snow?
Ah, Kate!  if pure, unmingled bliss
Be found in life's imperfectness,
All love, all fondness is outdone
By mother's o'er her first-born son:
That glow is bright, its workings kind,
Calm, chasten'd, ardent, yet refined.
I think &mdash; O!  may I be forgiven&mdash;
That nought can lovelier be in heaven,
Far less upon the earth below;
Methinks I see the visions now&mdash;
What, Keatie, do ye rue our meeting?
I think ye're fuffing now, an' greeting?

KATE.
Tuts!  what for will ye speak sae queer,
Of things unmeet for maiden's ear?
I canna bide that stuff sae sensuous,
It sounds like something that's licentious:
Yet these are truths the heart that strike&mdash;
Ye may pray for babies gin ye like.

COLIN.
Ha, Keatie!  truth will aye bear sway,
An' nature work in her ain way,
For ye are nature's child complete,
A mountain rose unsoil'd an' sweet,
A gem the desert that perfumes,
A flower that hardly kens it blooms.
When we grow auld, an' bow'd wi' age,
We'll make an yearly pilgrimage
Unto this wild an' lonely scene,
An' greet o'er days lang past an' gane.
'Twill mind me of thy guileless heart,
Of what remains and what thou wert,&mdash;
And I'll think of a day of bliss,
And maiden made to love an' kiss,
Wha aince gart me the preaching miss:
An' waur than that; when her behest
A solemn task had on me press'd,
She flew up wi' a wicked screed,
An' pat a' praying frae my head.

KATE.
Here, with the tear drap in my ee,
Colin, I beg you'll pardon me.
I did amiss, 'mang passions rife,
But could not help it for my life.
In my reproof, though scarce ye'll trow,
I was at least sincere as you.
And now I beg of me you'll take
This book, an' keep it for my sake;
It was my honour'd father's gift
That day when I our cottage left,
With bitter grief, and youthfu' dread,
In the wide world to earn my bread.
"My bairn," quo' he, "ye're gaun to leave me;
I hope through life you'll never grieve me.
If ever sin your fancy brook,
Think on the Author of this book&mdash;
Think how he reads the heart within,
And grieves if you should yield to sin.
An' think o' your old father too,
And how his soul yearns over you.
An' O, my bairn, when I am dead,
Cling to this blessed book, an' read
Its holy precepts when you may,
An' God will give you grace to pray,
To pray in purity of heart.
Farewell, my bairn, since we maun part!"

Now, Colin, as my sole director,
My trusted, generous protector,
Here do I render up to thee
The charge of baith my book an' me,
And ne'er again, by it I swear,
'Twixt you and heaven to interfere.
Accept, dear Colin, the propine,
An' O forgie the heart that's thine!

He took the book, an' first he kiss'd
The donor, then the volume bless'd,
An' hid it in his bosom true,
While on his eyelids stood the dew;
Then hand in hand they trode the brae
That looks o'er Ettrick's wilder'd way,
An' parted on the mountain green,
Far happier than a king an' queen.
