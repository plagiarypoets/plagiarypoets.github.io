Where are Balclutha's turrets?  Desolate
And fall'n.  Silence dwells amid the halls.
Fire has been there, with his inveterate
Deep-printing tooth.  Diminished Clutha crawls,
Pushed from her ancient bed by crumbled walls.
There his white beard th' usurping thistle rears;
There over whistling moss the chafed wind brawls.
And see!  yon casement where the fox appears
Sole warden; peeping forth through the rank grass of years.
