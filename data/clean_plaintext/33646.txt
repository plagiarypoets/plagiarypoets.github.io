'Tis next to be observ'd, that care is due,
And sparingness in framing words anew:
You shew your mast'ry, if you have the knack
So to make use of what known word you take,
To give't a newer sense:  if there were need
For some uncommon matters to be said;
Pow'r of inventing terms may be allow'd,
Which Chaucer and his Age ne're understood:
Provided always, as 'twas said before,
We seldom, and discreetly use that pow'r.
Words new and forein may be best brought in,
If borrow'd from a Language near a kin:
Why should the pievish Criticks now forbid
To Lee and Dryden, what was not deny'd
To Shakespear, Ben and Fletcher heretofore,
For which they praise, and commendation bore?
If Spencer's Muse be justly so ador'd
For that rich copiousness, where with he stor'd
Our Native Tongue; for Gods sake why should I
Straight be thought arrogant, if modestly
I claim and use the self-same liberty?
This the just Right of Poets ever was,
And will be still to coin what words they please,
Well fitted to the present Age and Place. . . .
