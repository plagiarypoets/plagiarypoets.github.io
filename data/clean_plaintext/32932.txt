Ungratefull times that impiously neglect
That worth that never times againe shall shew,
What, merites all our toile no more respect?
Or else standes idlenes asham'd to know
Those wondrous Actions that do so object
Blame to the wanton, sin unto the slow?
Can England see the best that shee can boast
Ly thus ungrac'd, undeckt, and almost lost?

Why do you seeke for fained Palladins
Out of the smoke of idle vanitie,
That maie give glorie to the true dissignes
Of Bourchier, Talbot, Nevile, Willoughby?
Why should not you straive to fill up your lines
With wonders of your owne, with veritie?
T'Inflame their offspring with the love of Good
And glorious true examples of their blood.

O what eternall matter here is found!
Whence new immortal Iliads do abound
In blessed accents here maie have to feed
Good thoughts, on no imaginary ground
Of hungrie shadowes which no profit breed:
Whence musicke like, instant delight may grow,
But when men all do know they nothing know.

And why dost thou in lamentable verse
Nothing but bloudshed, treasons, sin and shame,
The worst of times, th' extreame of ils rehearse,
To raise old staines, and to renew dead blame?
As if the minds of th' evill, and perverse
Were not far sooner trained from the fame
By good example of faire vertuous acts,
Then by the shew of foule ungodly facts.

O that our times had some sacred wight,
Whose wordes as happie as our swordes had bin
To have prepared for us Trophies aright
Of undecaying frames t' have rested in:
Triumphant Arkes of perdurable might
O holy lines:  that such advauntage win
Upon the Sieth of time in spight of yeares,
How blessed they that gaine what never weares.
