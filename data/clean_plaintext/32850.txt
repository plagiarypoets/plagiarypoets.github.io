The strongest Pyne that Queene Feronia hath,
Growing within her woody Emperie,
Is soone throwne downe by Boreas windy wrath,
If one roote onely his supporter be,
The tallest Ship that cuts the angry Wave,
And plowes the Seas of Saturnes second sunne;
If but one Anchor for a journey have,
When that is lost gainst every Rocke doth runne;
I am that Pyne (faire love) that Ship am I,
And thou that Anchor art and roote to me,
If then thou faile, (oh faile not) I must die,
And pyne away in endlesse miserie:
But words prevaile not, nor can sighes devise,
To moove thy hart, if bent to tyrannize.
