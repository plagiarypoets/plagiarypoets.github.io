Hail, daughter of Imperial War!
Hail, matchless Fortitude!  whose crown
Blazes with Glory's golden star,
Whose state the highest heavens enthrone.
To thee alone the Fates ordain
A fix'd unperishable reign,
And bless thee with such boundless sway,
That all Creation's powers thy ample rule obey.

Beneath thy yoke the billowy sea
And stable earth's foundations lie;
To thee each nation bows the knee,
Immortal Empress of the Sky!
Ev'n Time, whose force all others own,
Submits, great Queen, to thee alone,
And never shifts the prosperous gale,
But with a constant breeze expands thy snowy sail.

Thou to the warrior band giv'st birth,
Who in the battle dare to bleed,
Whose firm and patriotic worth
Emblazons each heroic deed!
The harvest of thy noble train
Appears like Ceres' joyous reign,
When o'er the fields the Goddess pours,
With free and liberal hand, her golden-waving stores.
