And gracious guide, which doost all grace infuse,
Since it hath pleas'd thee taske my tardy Muse
With these high Theames, that through mine Art-les Pen
This holy Lampe may light my Country-men:
Ah teach my hand, touch mine unlearned lips,
Least, as the Earths grosse body doth Eclipse
Bright Cynthias beames; when it is interpos'd
Twixt her and Phoebus:  so mine ill-dispos'd
Darke, gloomy Ignorance, obscure the rayes
Of this divine Sunne of these learned dayes.
O furnish me with an un-vulgar stile,
That I by this may weane our wanton Ile
From Ovids heires, and their un-hallowed spell
Here charming sences, chayning soules in Hell.
Let This provoke our modern wits to sacre
Their woundrous gifts to honour thee their Maker:
That our mysterious ELFINE Oracle,
Deepe, morall, grave, inventions miracle:
My deere sweet DANIEL, sharp-conceipted, briefe,
Civill, sententious, for pure accents chiefe:
And our new NASO, that so passionates
Th' heroike sighes of love-sick Potentates:
May change their subject, and advance their wings
Up to these higher and more holy things.
And if (sufficient rich in selfe-invention)
They scorne (as I) to live of Strangers Pension,
Let them devise new Weekes, new Works, new waies
To celebrate the supreme Prince of prayse.
And let not me (good Lord) belike the Lead
Which to a Citie from some Conduit-head
Brings holsome waters, yet (selfe-wanting sence)
It selfe receaves no drop of comfort thence:
But rather, as the thorough-seasoned Butte
Wherein the teares of pressed Grapes are put,
Retaines (long after all the wine is spent)
Within it selfe the liquours lively sent:
Let me still savour of these heavenly sweets
Till Death fold-up mine earth in earthen sheetes,
Least, my young layes, now prove to preach the glory,
To BRUTUS heyres, blush at mine elder Story. . . .
