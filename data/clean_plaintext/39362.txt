How cheerful the birds on the spray,
How jocund throughout the cool grove,
How joyful and happy are they,
While the charms of dear freedom they prove;
But when caught and confin'd to a cage,
No longer they charm with their song;
'Till tenderness softens their rage,
From the fair-one to whom they belong.

'Tis thus with the youths of the plains,
Thro' the paths of gay pleasure they rove;
'Till beauty o'er them throws her chains,
And they soon become captives to love:
Awhile they may strive hard to break
Their bondage, and wish to be free;
But finding their efforts too weak,
Contentedly lose liberty.

Then use with discretion, ye fair,
The power to you o'er man given;
The hearts of the worthy take care
To preserve as a present from heaven:
Lay the care of your person aside,
From that but small comfort you'll find;
Make Prudence and Virtue your guide,
And strive to embellish your mind.
