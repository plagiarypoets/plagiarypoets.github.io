'Tis Time:  I feel him knocking at my heart,
And he shall hold his unresisted sway
Till yonder planets from their orbits start,
And this huge sepulchre, the Earth, decay.
Oh!  he has clouded many a festive day
With angry feuds or Jealousy's mistrust;
He strikes the blood-stained tyrant with dismay,
And buries ancient palaces in dust;
Wreathing vile weeds around the sculptur'd bust.
The mightiest dynasties before him fall,
As steel is canker'd by corrosive rust,
Or as the storm hurls down some pond'rous wall.
Yet, lo!  the day, &mdash; the awful day of doom
Shall bury Time, &mdash; the peopler of the tomb.
