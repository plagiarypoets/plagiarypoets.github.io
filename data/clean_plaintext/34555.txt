Lo!  here the Place for Contemplation made,
For sacred Musing, and for solemn Song!&mdash;
&mdash;Hence, ye profane!  nor violate the Shade.
Come, SPENSER's awful Genius, come along,
Mix with the Music of th' aerial Throng!
Oh!  breath a pensive Stillness thro' my Breast,
While balmy breezes pant the Leaves among,
And sweetly sooth my Passions into rest.
Hint purest Thoughts, in purest Colours drest,
Ev'n such as Angels prompt, in golden Dreams
To holy Hermit, high in raptures blest,
His Bosom burning with celestial Beams.
Ne less the Raptures of my Summer Day,
If SPENSER deign with me to moralize the Lay.
