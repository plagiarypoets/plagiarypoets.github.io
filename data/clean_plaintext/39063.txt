While in the sky black clouds impend,
And chill winds blow, and rains descend,
And one brown prospect opens round
Of leafless trees, and furrow'd ground;
Save here and there th' unmelted snow
Appears, some shrubby black below;
What pleasing views shall sooth the pensive mind,
That wont in rural scenes unenvy'd joys to find.

Whate'er th' inclement clime denies,
Fancy, indulgent Pow'r!  supplies,
And wafts me o'er th' Atlantic main,
And lands on some delightful plain;
Bright is the sun, and mild the breeze,
And bloom and verdure deck the trees,
And the lone Indian roams the forest wild,
With native freedom blest, by av'rice undespoil'd:

Where mid'st high hills, with gloomy cedars crown'd,
Some smiling vale extends its round,
Of bended boughs his cottage made,
The broad Palmeto's leaves o'ershade;
The little maize-field waving near,
And climbing gourds with golden fruit appear,
And many a healthful herb and spicy flow'ret grow,
Beside the silver rills, that down the green swamp flow.

I wish th' inchanting prospect here,
And blame our ever-changing year,
Till Fancy seeks the Polar coast,
The realm of night, and realm of frost,
Where on an icy mountain's height,
Seen only by the moon's pale light,
Stern Winter frowning sits, and o'er the plain
Sends Want and Horror forth, his desolating train.

And are there those who this sustain?
There are, and I no more complain&mdash;
And now, descry'd by Fancy's eye,
Fair Spring descends the southern sky;
A primrose wreath surrounds her hair,
Her green robe floats upon the air,
She waves her wanton wings, and round her show'rs
Soft dews and rich perfumes, and variegated flow'rs.

O Fancy!  thus thy ever active pow'r
Can chear the solitary hour;
Be near me still, and to my mind
Bring images of various kind;
But most, for these can most engage,
The transcripts fair of Nature's pleasing page;
And heed thee well, blithe Nymph!  amid thy mingled train,
That all the chaste and fair, and free from guilt and pain.
