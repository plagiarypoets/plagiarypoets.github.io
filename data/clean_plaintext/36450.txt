Not sedentary all:  there are who roam
To scatter seeds of life on barbarous shores;
Or quit with zealous step their knee-worn floors
To seek the general mart of Christendom;
Whence they, like richly-laden Merchants, come
To their beloved Cells: &mdash; or shall we say
That, like the Red-cross Knight, they urge their way,
To lead in memorable triumph home
Truth &mdash; their immortal Una?  Babylon,
Learned and wise, hath perished utterly,
Nor leaves her speech wherewith to clothe a sigh
That would lament her; &mdash; Memphis, Tyre, are gone
With all their Arts, &mdash; but classic lore glides on
By these Religions saved for all posterity.
