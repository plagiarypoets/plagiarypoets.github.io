Now twilight draws her dark'ning veil,
The owls their dwellings quit;
The pleasing, pensive hour, I hail,
For contemplation fit.

Forth from my humble cot I stray,
For well I love the time,
Or through the vale to take my way,
Or up the hill to climb.

Through trackless plains my steps to urge,
To penetrate the grove,
Or by the riv'let's rushy verge,
In thoughtful mood to rove.

Oft it's slow-winding course I trace,
Which leads where all must go,
To the still church-yard, that sad place,
Where many a friend lies low.

There, where it laves the sacred sod
With gently murmuring noise,
Full oft the "margent green" I've trod,
And tasted tranquil joys.

Beheld the Moon on silver car
Slow riding thro' the night;
Have seen, with thought sublime, each star
That lent its twinkling sight.

Or with some much-lov'd friend convers'd,
While swift the hours have fled,
Some friend who now is turn'd to dust,
And on whose grave I tread.

But ah!  by pale Diana's light,
Which now begins to beam;
His heart was kind and warm;
Whom I did most esteem.

Bright Virtue reign'd within his breast,
His heart was kind and warm;
And Nature too had done her best,
In fashioning his arm.

Full oft in rural solitude,
We've studied Wisdom's ways;
Full oft the Muse together woo'd,
In simple artless lays.

But now those happy hours are past,
No more to be enjoy'd;
The bud of genius, Death's rough blast
Has wither'd and destroy'd.

Close at yon solemn yew-tree's root,
In peace the poet sleeps;
Around his grave wild roses shoot,
And near, the willow weeps.

No sumptuous marble decks the green,
His praises to rehearse;
But on a rude carv'd stone is seen,
This tributary verse:

THE EPITAPH.
Here, in the silence of the tomb,
A humble bard lies low,
His faults, his virtues, and his doom,
The last great day will show.

Reader, if Nature to thy breast,
A feeling heart ne'er gave,
Pass on; but if with genius blest
Weep o'er "the poet's grave."
