Ye fond desires!  that flush the purple cheek,
And revel in the sunny eye of Joy!
Ye melting Looks!  that Love's soft language speek,
Divinest rhetoric you can employ;
Ye sighs!  that from the blissful bosom break,
With not unpleasing, amorous annoy;
Farewell: &mdash; and quickly catch the white-wing'd hour,
Ere fell Despair, ungracious fiend!  destroy
Affection's soft recess, and Rapture's rosey bow'r.

For ever, silent be my sylvan flute,
Which COLIN'S tuneful lip did, erst, inspire;
No more may it the grey-ey'd Morn salute;
Or lead the jocund Eve-star's sheeny Quire;
Ye fays!  for ever more your minstrel's mute:
So, sit ye, songless, by the glow-worm's fire;
Or hide beneath the mountain's misty brow;
Or to the copse's cheerless depth retire:
Ah me!  I have no heart for elphin-pastime now!

Sore is my sorrow, and beyond repair:
Of all the nymphs that blest those ardent eyes,
She was, in sooth, the most bewitching fair,
And might be deem'd an Inmate of the Skies;
What modest graces mark'd her angel-air,
With sweet unconscious charm, which mock'd disguise,
And round her lucent form, resistless, spread?
Ye fond Desires!  ye melting Looks!  ye Sighs!
Farewell! &mdash; from transport's fold my long-lov'd MARY'S fled.
