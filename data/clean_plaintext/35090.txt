On the green summit of a craggy dell,
Enrich'd with mouldering fragments of old time,
The hoary thorn, the harebell, violet prime,
Where, 'erst the magic dance and merry spell,
Of Love's true joys adown the elfin lawn,
Kept the wild sport by twilight and by dawn;

Here roam'd, enrich'd by her fairy train,
The source of mental bliss, Dame Fancy hight,
The wide unbound of earth and air, and light,
Freely, she kenn'd by her all-piercing eye;
Delighting oft to teach her listening fays,
Of truth sublime, of wonder, aye, and praise!

One dusky dawn, surrounded by her throng,
She chear'd their little hearts from rueful dread,
(For, truth doth always chear if rightly sped)
All swift of foot, a winding path along,
Tripp'd a soft Virgin, graceful, aye, and pure,
That, freed from earth, could Heav'n alone ensure!

Blest be thy speed, kind Fancy said, and now
Forth from her fairy ring, she beam'd a smile,
To lead the Nymph, and every fear beguile;
A ray serene dwelt on her downcast brow;
Fancy beheld Theresa's modest grace,
And tears of joy did mingle their embrace.

Ah, haste, spirit of etherial light,
Rise to the bliss no time can ever cloy,
Learn there to count thy suffering as thy joy,
And know, that in the triumph of thy flight,
'Tis Fancy leads thee by her brightest ray!&mdash;
She rose upon the Seraph's wing to endless day!

And thou, who bad'st the World admire her name,
Whose ardour bursts all poignant from the soul,
Let no vain forms these energies controul,
Or dare repress they rapturous flight to fame:
Henceforth I guide thee to yon star-clad throne,
And call Theresa's virtues all thy own!
