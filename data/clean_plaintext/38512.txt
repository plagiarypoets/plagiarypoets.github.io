Hail to this bright, this happy Morn!
Ye Harps, strike up the lay!
For know the Son of God was born
On this auspicious Day!
Exalt the festive song, O Earth!
Ye Mountains, greet the Monarch's birth!
With joy and gladness let the Vallies ring,
And jocund Nature hail the Universal King.

He comes, he comes, the promis'd Child,
With healing in his wings;
His power how vast!  his sway how mild!
O praise the King of Kings!
He comes the Serpent's head to bruise,
O spread abroad the happy news!
Ye Maids of Salem, haste your Lord to meet,
And thou, O Judah, pour thy treasures at his feet.

O Bethlehem, in thy lowly lap,
The SAVIOUR lays his head;
With care his precious limbs enwrap,
And watch his sainted bed!
Ye wand'ring Shepherds!  hither come,
Bring hither, Kings!  your choice perfume:
See a bright Orb its golden lustre shd,
And beam a lambent glory round the Infant's head!

Aghast and baffled at the sight
The King of Terrors lies,
Whilst to his kindred shades of Night
The fell Red Dragon flies;
The King of Glory shall dispell
The soul-benighting glooms of Hell!
Ye star-pavillion'd Thrones, ye radiant Spheres,
Know that to-day on Earth a God, a God appears!

But hark! &mdash; from yonder cleaving skies
What Music greets my ear!
What streams of glory feast my eyes!&mdash;
'Tis ANGELS that appear!
On Sion's Mount I hear the Throng
Divide with Me the choral song
"To God on high all glory be assign'd,
On Earth henceforth be peace, good-will to all Mankind!"

To thee, O MAN, this Morn is given
The day-spring of eternal Joy;
For lo!  the golden keys of Heaven
Are borne by this immortal BOY.
Ye Nations all, glad homage pay,
Welcome!  oh welcome be this day!
Let Earth and Heaven in unison rejoice,
And Men and Angels join the solemn Organ's voice!
Hallelujah!
