TO PHILOSOPHICAL NECESSITY.
Stern Queen of gods and men, Necessity!
Formatrix of the acts of human kind!
What mortal pow'r, alas!  can fathom thee,
In thy mysterious intercourse with mind?
Yet, man may darkly trace thee, though he's blind,
In each thing, present, active, every where,
With nature and with art alike combin'd,
Whose causes and effects thy pow'r declare
Thro' all this scene of things, deform or fair!
Old as eternal Nature tho' thou art!
Tho' none with thee thy iron rule can share,
And tho' thou claim'st no kindred with the heart;
Yet &mdash; and, ah!  who must not? &mdash; Necessity!
Sister of Nature!  bend I down to thee!

SONNET TO LOVE.
Child of the Cnidian Queen!  young Eros hail!
For ever blooming, bland, and beauteous boy!
Whose breath is incense floating on the gale,
Whose sighs are sighs of tenderness and joy,
That with satiety can never cloy;
Whose wings are lightsome, and whose bow is strung
For shafts that but deliciously annoy,
Flame-tipp'd, bright peering from thy quiver, hung
In graceful sort; while music from thy tongue
Is each sweet word thou breath'st into the ear
Of youthful lovers, sylvan wilds among;
Whose days are happy, and have nought to fear:
Oh!  come, illume me!  breathing amorous sighs,
With torch lit at thy beauteous mother's eyes!

SONNET TO MADNESS.
Queen of the wayward will and wandering mind,
With hollow eye, with feature deathly pale,
And loose locks streaming on the gusty wind!
Madness!  I hear thy melancholy tale;
Thy mournful musings on mine ear prevail:
Anon, bedeck'd with straw-constructed crown,
I see thy poor phantasy regale
With visionary prospects of renown:
And now I mark thee, stern, with darkling frown,
Foaming infuriate, wild with ruthless rage,
With manacles of iron pinion'd down,
That scarce have power thy phrensy to assuage.
Ah!  say, thou wretched daughter of Despair,
Com'st thou on earth to crown corroding Care!
