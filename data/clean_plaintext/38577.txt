How sweetly the moments all flew!
They are past, and return not again,
Yes!  sweet were the pleasures I knew,
When, Lucy, gave charms to the plain.

Return ye dear moments, return!
The Peace of my mind you'll restore;
For, Lucy, I languish and burn,
And must I then see her no more:

No more the dear maid must I see,
My heart sure with anguish will break;
The world has no pleasures for me,
Or none that my heart can partake:

In vain to forget her I strive;
No time can my passion remove,
While memory keeps it alive,
And shews me the maid that I love.
