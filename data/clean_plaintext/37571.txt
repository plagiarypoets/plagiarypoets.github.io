Tread soft, ye mortals, o'er this hallow'd ground!
Full many gentle villagers here rest
Who till'd in days of yore the fields around,
With calm contentment, humble virtue blest.

Go, seek the flow'ry paths of peace they trod,
From guilt, ambition, and from sorrow free;
Like them, thy neighbour love, adore thy God,
And for thy race provide with industry.

So mayest thou, when Fate shall seal thy doom,
And thou beneath the grass-green sod shall lie,
Like them enjoy the sabbath of the tomb,
Like them ascend to endless bliss on high!
