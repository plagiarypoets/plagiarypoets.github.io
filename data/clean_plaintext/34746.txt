Wine, lovely maid, and truth agree;
I'm mellow &mdash; learn this truth from me;
And hear my secret thoughts; "I find,
You love me not with all your mind."
Your beauty life and vigour gives,
In you my half-existence lives;
The other half has sadly sped,
The other half, alas!  is dead.
Whene'er you smile auspicious love,
I'm happy as the gods above;
Whene'er your frowns displeasure show,
I'm wretched as the fiends below.
Sure 'tis unmeet with cold disdain
To torture thus a love-sick swain:
But could my words your thoughts engage,
Experience is the boast of age,
Take counsel, and when crown'd with store
Of blessings, then you'll praise me more.
"Build in one tree a single nest,
Which no curs'd reptile can infest."
Fond and unfix'd you wander now
From tree to tree, from bough to bough.
If any youth your charms commends
You rank him with your faithful friends,
Your first true lovers set aside;
This looks like vanity and pride.
Would you live long and happy too,
Love some kind equal that loves you.
This will esteem and favour gain,
Such love will never give you pain;
This wins all hearts, and will controul
The stubborn temper of my soul.
If with my counsel you agree,
Give me sweet kisses for my fee.
