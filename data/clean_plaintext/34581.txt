Hence Melancholy, pensive maid,
In stole of sable hue array'd,
With visage wan, and fixed eye,
Daughter of pining Misery:
Hence thou sullen fiend, Despair:
Hence Grief, and self-consuming Care:
Hence Thou, who lately didst inspire
With mournful strains the plaintive lyre,
Melpomene; hence wing thy rapid flight;
And silent seek the gloomy shades of night.

Come Mirth, thou laughter-loving boy;
Come buxom Sport with rosy Joy;
Come, hither lead in merry glee
Thy jocund train, Festivity.
Whilst on the dew-impearled plain
Ye trip it round and round again,
Thalia, chearful muse, shall sing,
And lightly touch the tuneful string:
Enraptur'd with the song, fair Isis' grove
Forgets to whisper; and her streams to move.

And list! &mdash; sweet sounds of warbling flute,
Tabret, or merry harp, or lute,
Borne on the balmy-breathing gale
Steal from yon gay, enamell'd vale.
Hark!  hark! &mdash; they come &mdash; and now, more near,
They sweetly charm my list'ning ear.
And lo!  two forms majestic tread
The flow'ry bosom of the mead;
This Honour seems, of bold and comely mien;
That Virtue's softer form, and look serene.

See, now the little Loves advance
And mingle in the mazy dance:
Now with united skill and care
The sister Graces deck the fair;
And while they strew the nuptial bow'rs
With fresh-cull'd amaranthine flow'rs;
Virtue and Honour, hand in hand,
Near the pure-blazing altar stand.
Lo!  Hymen now the sacred knot has tied,
And Virtue is the British Monarch's bride.

Hail, Royal Pair!  by heav'n design'd
To govern, and to bless mankind.
Long o'er Britannia's grateful plain
Extend the blessings of your reign,
Thrice happy Pair, by heav'n design'd
To govern, and to bless mankind;
May future times with rapture trace
Your virtues blooming in your race:
While they, like you, the regal scepter sway;
Like us, may Britain's free-born sons obey.
