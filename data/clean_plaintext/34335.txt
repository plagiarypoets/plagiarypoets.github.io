Ere yet, my friend, approach the evil day,
From the town's noise and vanity retreat;
Seek Happiness without it's base allay,
And leave ambition to the wretch of state;
Oh!  bid again thy tott'ring mansion rise,
There seek for independent bliss &mdash; all else despise.

There nor the pride of office, frown of pow'r,
The courtier's promise, nor the law's delay,
Nor pallid envy e'er shall curse the hour,
Calm and serene, or innocently gay;
Your joys no luxury shall know to cloy,
Nor Tantal avarice shall e'er forbid t' enjoy.

There decency shines forth in home-spun vest,
There innocence with ever chearful smiles,
And health with all her fragrant roses drest,
Uncertain physic's greedy art beguiles;
Whilst lavish plenty, with her joyous train,
Sings thro' th' extended vale, and laughs along the plain.

More sweet than southern gales her breath's perfume,
With beauty's ev'ry charm her cheeks array'd,
Excelling, FLORA, all thy gayest bloom,
Excelling blushes of the city maid.
Long, Britain, may thy fields with plenty shine,
And matchless beauty, blessed isle, be ever thine.

Since wealth sufficient grateful fields can give,
Let passion's rage, and honour's wish subside;
From nature joy and study both receive,
And know the bar to inward peace is pride:
For happiness, to no one state confin'd,
Scorns every other empire &mdash; throned in the mind.

Ere yet the early lark salutes the skies
With gratitude, that man forgets to pay;
From his low turf-built cot see labour rise,
With hands industrious to prevent the day,
Or view him blest at morn or noon's repast,
With appetite unknown to lux'ries splendid feast.

Nor treachery's art his humble meal annoys,
Nor poison fears he in his homely bowl;
With pleasure all the hours of day employs,
Smiles at his task, enjoying all it's toil;
Tho' on vile flocks his wearied limbs he lay
The night's unbroken sleep renews them for the day.
