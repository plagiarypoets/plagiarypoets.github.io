If aught an artless shepherd pipes or sings
May hope, chaste Eve, to sooth thy modest ear,
Like thy own solemn springs,
Thy springs and breezes dear;

O nymph reserv'd!  while now the bright-hair'd sun,
In cloudy tent, wove with ethereal braid,
(His daily race nigh run)
O'erhangs his wavy bed;

Now air is hush'd, save where the bat flits round
With short, shrill shriek, on leathern pinion borne,
Or beetle, gins to sound
His small, but sullen horn,

Oft striking 'gainst the pilgrim, journeying late,
As rude with heedless hum he drives along;
Now teach me, maid sedate,
To breathe some softened song,

Whose murmurs, stealing down thy dark'ning vale,
May, not unseemly suit the sober scene,
As, musing slow, I hail
Thy lov'd return serene!

For when thy folding star, arisen displays
His paly circlet, at his warning ray,
The fragrant Hours and Fays,
Who slept in flowers the day,

And many a sedge-crown'd nymph that haunts the wild,
And sheds the freshening dew, and still more fair,
The pensive pleasures mild,
The shadowy car prepare.

Then lead, calm votaress, where some sheety lake
Cheers the lone heath, or some time-hallowed fane,
Or fallow grounds opaque
Its last, cool gleam retain.

But when chill, blustering winds the woods molest,
Or driving rain, be mine the sheltered cell,
That from the mountains breast
Views wilds and floods that swell,

And glimmering spires, and hamlets wrapt in trees,
And hears their simple bell, and marks o'er all,
Deepening by slow degrees,
The dewy shadows fall.

While Spring's warm showers descend, as oft they use,
And bathe, meek Eve, thy locks, that fragrant breathe,
While Summer loves to muse
Thy lingering light beneath;

While sallow autumn strews with leaves the plain,
Or winter, rushing round the troublous pole,
Affrights thy shrinking train,
And rudely rends thy stole;

So long, sure found in scenes of lone retreat,
Shall fancy, friendship, science, health, proclaim
Thy genial influence sweet,
And hymn thy favourite name.
