Avaunt!  ye crowds who dare to sing
The virtues of a patriot King,
Or give a loose to joy,
Tis ours to puzzle and confound,
Throw all distinctions to the ground,
To level and destroy.

Perish that word, SUBORDINATION!
The bane of every liberal nation,
Which ties the public hands,
Which bars the needy &mdash; cows the brave,
Makes every free-born man a slave,
To till or guard the lands.

Who's he that wears the regal crown?
Or he who sweeps the Reverend gown?
Or Judges of the laws?
Or he on honours summit plac'd?
Or he by arts, or learning grac'd?
"Mere patches, shreds, and straws."

Or who is he encircl'd round,
With acres of paternal ground,
Who proudly sits in state?
What claims has he to all this land,
Whilst crowds like us can scarcely stand,
Without the prison gate?

Or who is he who patient strains,
To fence around his little gains,
Against life's last retreat?
Shall such a wretch as this presume,
(A thing that asks such little room)
To celebrate Our Fete?

Avaunt all such &mdash; this sacred place
Let none approach &mdash; but babes of grace,
Who love uproarious things,
Who Lords despise, and Bishops hate,
Who rail at Ministers of State,
But most of all &mdash; at Kings.

GREAT SOULS &mdash; who are by nature free,
Who like the birds from tree to tree
Can hop and peck their fare,
Who when they're glutted with the best,
Can lay their wearied soul to rest,
No matter how, or where.

Who want, nor industry &mdash; or wealth,
But, like the Spartans, live by stealth,
The antient law of life.
Who keep no reckoning, pay no debt,
Who never pine, or sigh, or fret,
Or yield to care or strife.

SPIRIT OF DISCORD!  then arise!
With ebon heart, and wily eyes,
To aid our free-born plan,
Seduce the loyal &mdash; temperate scare,
Turn all to venerate, or fear,
The boundless Rights of Man.

Call likewise from below &mdash; thy rare ones,
The Johnny Knoxes &mdash; Praise God Barebones,
With all that pious race,
Which erst did general freedom found,
Whilst DEAR LICENTIOUSNESS around,
Uprear'd her levelling face.

For this thy statue we will raise
In BRASS &mdash; which shall bestride the seas
Which flow 'twixt us and France,
That all the world with awe might see,
How by the power we both agree,
In one chaotic dance.

DA CAPO.
SPIRIT OF DISCORD then arise!
