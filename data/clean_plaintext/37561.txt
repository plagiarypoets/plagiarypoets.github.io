Loud screamed the owl, and bats had winged their way,
From what the serious mind contemplates most;
From where the rural virgins fear to stray,
For moonlight shadow, or the stalking ghost.

In that lone spot, perhaps some beauty lies;
Whose form angelic moulders fast away;
No more, shall love reanimate her eyes,
Or voice recall her to the passing day.

Some tender pair, with dire disease opprest,
Whose lisping orphans scarce can tell their loss;
Some lovers, join'd in everlasting rest,
Some godlike Howard, or some Man of Ross.

And then, kind Anna, to the poor so dear;
No more shall smooth Affliction's thorny bed,
No more from Sorrow's cheek shall wipe the tear:
Alas!  she's number'd with the silent dead.

Clay-cold those hands which ever help'd Distress,
O why!  thou tyrant Death, this awful change?
Why strike thy arrow thro' the tenderest breast,
And leave the guilty wretch at large to range?

Th' emblazon'd monument erected nigh,
Perhaps contains some sordid flinty heart;
Whose breast ne'er felt the tender pitying sigh;
Or single mite for misery sat apart.

Ah!  what avails illustrious by birth?
Nor glittering star, nor coronet can save:
Alike the marble pile, or mound of earth,
The great and poor are equal in the grave.

Thou Power Supreme, mild heaven-born Virtue send;
O guide my heart to all that's good and great:
From malice, pride, and thoughtless vice defend,
And fit me for th' unknown, the certain state.
