That fate how hard where genius is depress'd
By poverty, and hid in shades obscure;
The ardent flame that would with lustre shine
Bright and effulgent, as the solar beam,
Is stifl'd and but shows a glimm'ring ray,
The patriotic mind, the hero's flame,
The deeply searching philosophic sage,
And they who might have tun'd the Muses' lyre
To strains seraphic, that would raise the heart
To heav'nly transports  and celestial joys,
Lie hid, obscure among the vulgar throng,
And waste their days in ignorant disguise.

Where rural TIVIOT rolls his silver waves
The verdant woods and rocky hills among,
Whose airy summits crown'd with tufted groves,
The half embrown'd and half in mantle green,
O'er-arch the rills that from their fountains flow
And murmur smoothly through the grassy dale,
T' adorn the wild sequester'd fairy scene.
There old Palemon dwelt, a simple swain,
Such as Arcadians were in golden times,
Of venerable aspect, sweet and mild;
Gray were the locks that round his temples flow'd,
And wanton'd graceful in the passing gale.
The darling of his youth, and staff of age,
Was virtuous Emma whom he fondly lov'd
In youth, and friendship sweet'ned all their days;
Bless'd with one pledge of soft connubial love,
They pass'd their time, the happiest pair that liv'd.

Fair, as the morning, smil'd the lovely boy
Yclep'd SILVANUS, in the forests bred;
As some fair tree beside the river's brink
Grows green and stately, lovely to behold,
So grew Silvanus, in the bloom of youth,
His cheeks were tinged with the rosy dye,
His waving locks adown his shoulders fell
In beauteous ringlets:  such, as Poets tell,
Was young Adonis, or the Phrygian boy,
Whom rival goddesses did once surround,
And made him umpire of the golden prize.

All saw and lov'd Silvanus, yet an air
Of pensive thoughtful melancholy sat
Strongly depainted on his youthful brow,
And downcast eyes, that ever lov'd the ground:
Nor would he mingle in the rural sports,
Or join the revels of the youthful train;
Deep in his heart the inward pleasure glow'd
For solitude and joy to them unknown.

Soon as Aurora ting'd the blue serene,
And orient skies with ruddy lustre shone,
Companion of the lark, he bent his way
Along the lawns, and brush'd the dews of morn;
And, as the landscape brightned all around,
He gaz'd enraptur'd on the lovely scene:
From hill to hill his eyes excursive rov'd,
O'er waving forests and the barren wilds,
Or reach'd the summit of an airy hill,
Or trac'd the gloomy thickets of the grove;
Pleas'd with the sound of woodland melody,
The bleat of flocks, the tuneful shepherd's pipe,
The falling waters and the murm'ring breeze.

Far from the sight of the incurious eye,
And only to the lonely shepherd known,
Among the heath-clad hills and vales obscure,
A rapid current roll'd its foamy wave,
O'er precipices of stupendous height,
And rous'd the echoes, with the thund'ring noise,
Where fractur'd rocks, and old fantastic oaks
Nodded impending o'er the hoary steep:
There would he sit, beneath some aged tree,
And view the rudely wild romantic scene;
Pleas'd all alone, the livelong summer day,
T' indulge the sweet enthusiastic joy.

When the bright Sun descended in the west,
And modest Cynthia shed her silver light,
Then would he listen to the mournful song
Of am'rous philomela, in the bow'r,
Or, where some ruin'd castle's tott'ring walls,
O'ergrown with ivy, nodded to the moon,
Where oft, as superstitious peasants tell,
Grim ghosts of murther'd Warriors stalk'd around,
He wander'd, and in rapt attention, heard
The night owl, and the boding raven's voice
Sound sad and solemn in the lonely halls.

Nor were the spring and summer months less dear,
Or less amusing to the wondrous youth
Than when the earth was clad in ermine robe,
And gurgling streams, in icy fetters bound;
Or when the wind and stormy tempests roar'd,
And warring elements, in dire affray,
Thunder'd terrific, still he felt a joy
That rais'd ideas dreadfully sublime.

Fain would he try'd, in language fit, to paint
The sweets of spring, the summers gaudy pride,
The wealth of autumn, and in strains sublime,
To sing the horrors of a wintry storm;
And oft, in artless lays, and numbers wild
He bravely try'd the great advent'rous theme.
