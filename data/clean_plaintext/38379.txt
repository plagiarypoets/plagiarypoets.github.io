To you, ye Rustics of the present Age,
In life's low vale, I dedicate my page;
Sworn foe to Pride, and every selfish aim,
A shepherd lad &mdash; he seeks no better name:
With hat in hand presents his rural lays,
And begs your patronage and honest praise.

When fair forfoghten at the weary pleugh,
Or at the harrow, fasht an' tir'd enough;
At e'en their sangs may hap to gie ye sport,
An' help to gar the weary hour seem short,
If ye, perusing, ay when ye're at leisure,
Reap in the reading, e'en but ha'f the pleasure,
That I, in writing by mysel', enjoy'd;
Or in the field, or by the Ingle side;
Ye'll far frae think, I ween, your minutes lost,
But smiling read &mdash; despising care an' cost.

Destructive critics!  thrawart, gloomy kaes!
For Heaven's sake &mdash; O!  squint not o'er my lays!
No! &mdash; never, with such stuff, your fingers file,
(For this plain reason) &mdash; 'tis not worth your while.
For you I write not &mdash; 'tis the' unletter'd swains,
My gay coevals, on our northern plains,
Whose humble wishes ne'er inclin'd to stray
Beyond their hawthorn scenes, and russet gray.
