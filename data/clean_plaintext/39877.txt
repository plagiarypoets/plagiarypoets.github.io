On every side, far as the eye could see,
'Twas one wide, wild, expanse of living green,
Fading in distance, till it seemed to be
Lost in a mild blue sky's descending sheen;
Here smooth as waveless ocean, and there seen
To rise in gentle undulations; all
Was motionless and still as nought had been
To break the listening silence, save the call
Of gently murmuring wood to distant water fall.

Far in the west, a ridge of mist which shone,
Lit by the sun's fresh beams, a wave of fire,
Told where the winding Genesee rolled on,
Through vales as lovely as did erst inspire
Thy bards, proud Greece, or, England, wake thy lyre,
Thro' vales then wild, where now the clustering vine
Mantles the elm, the home of woodland quire,
Beneath whose umbrage countless flocks recline,
Its waters dark, to mix, Ontario, with thine.

And northward far, thy sheeted lake serene
Shone like a purple cloud, which oft doth lie
Calmly, and mild as hope's unalter'd mien,
When the dim landscape fades in distant sky,
Oh 'tis a sight to win a seraph's eye!
And I have loved its deep tranquility,
Have gazed upon it, till a gentle sigh
Of happiness stole forth, and peacefully
My softened spirit sunk in sweet serenity.

And didst thou place it there, great God, to show
An image of celestial loveliness?
To mock the strife and mad turmoil, which throw
A blight around us, and each joy oppress?
How beautiful!  Oh it hath power to bless!
The strife-worn bosom with a throb of heaven,
Did soothing thoughts upon its musing press,
Distant, revenge and hate afar be driven,
And every foe forgot, and every wrong forgiven.
