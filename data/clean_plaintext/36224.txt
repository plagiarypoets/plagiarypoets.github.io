Beautiful Spirit, who dost sit at eve
Within thy tapestried hall of shield and spear,
Upgazing where the dying sun-beams leave
The heaven in crimson &mdash; on thy cheek a tear,
Like dew upon the red rose, quivering, clear&mdash;
From thy pale brow half raised thy nun-like hood&mdash;
Thy ruby lip half opened, as to hear
Some floating music of the sky or wood&mdash;
Come, sweet Romance!  from thine enchanted solitude.

Not for myself I woo thee now to stand
Beside the harp:  Loved Spirit, spread thy wings
Of veiling splendour over one whose hand
Wakes its first music from the golden strings;&mdash;
For he is thy true votary, and clings
To thy fallen altar with a love sublime,
And brings a gift of wild and witching things
From glorious Greece, from the Italian prime,
A coronal of gems from the rich depths of time.
