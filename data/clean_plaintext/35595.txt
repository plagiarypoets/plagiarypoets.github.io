If, shepherde, heavenlie beautye can thee move,
If gentle courtesie can charme thy mynde,
Let not thine eyes e'er stray to her I love,
O liste not to her wordes moste sweet and kynde!
Though sweete and kynde her wordes, and voide of arte,
Yet cold indifference dwelleth in her hearte.

Doste thou admyre a looke both bryghte and meeke?
The starre of eve beams in her modeste eye:
Lovste thou the rose? &mdash; 'tis on her blushynge cheeke,
And lendes its honied fragrance to her sigh;
Alas!  that she should sigh my payne to see,
Yet still escape from love's captivity!

O where can I, to shunne the archer's aime,
Flie from those charmes that have my peace undonne!
To wisdome's page? &mdash; No, wisdome fannes my flame,
And virtue sayes, thy faire and I are one:
Ah me!  that hopelesse I am doomde to pyne,
To see those sweetes, yet may not call them myne!
