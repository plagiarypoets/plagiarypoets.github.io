ROBIN.
So Symon, lie you here?  its weil wi' you,
To sing an' sleep's the maist ye ha'e to do:
God help us!  we our lang-held houff maun flee,
And seek anither hame beyond the sea;
While laid fu' keidgily aneath the shade,
Wi' leaves an' lilies round your head;
Of dautit Peggy's gowden locks you sing,
Till hill an' dale wi' Peggy's praises ring.

SYMON.
O Robin, a' this happiness you see,
The laird, God bless his honour!  ga'e to me:
We mauna part; an' whan he gets his due,
The lady san'na want a bountith ewe;
For aft he bids me ca' them wi' his ain,
And aft has hobbl'd at my merry strain.

ROBIN.
Lang be it sae:  But man, can ye find out
Why ilka thing's gaen withershins about?
I'm sick mysel:  the oindroch flock I ca',
You see to skin an' bane are dow'd awa.
Our paughty knabs have sauls as hard as flint,
And beasts their naturality ha'e tint.
This back-gen beaugh that fills my weary hands,
Ew'd lamies twa amang the willow-wands:
But, strange to tell!  as soon's she loot them fa',
The barb'rous creature up, and ran awa.
My mind was doited, or I might ha'e kent
That this would follow whan my trees were rent.
O!  whan the corbie croup'd an' crummy grain'd,
Had I mysel, my ewes, an' planting fain'd,
This day my fortune had not been sae blae,
Nor had I tumbled backlins down the brae.
But, Symon, whar gaed ye the laird to meet?

SYMON.
Robin, was ever ye on Reikie's street!
Glaud anes was there; an' mony a time ye've heard,
An' mony a time hae questions at him spear'd
Of what he saw.  As lang's the lift's aboon,
Glaud's tales o' Reikie never will be done.
Indeed, till I was there, I thought our nown
Might bell the cat wi' ony borough's town;
I might as weil ha'e even'd trees to grains,
Or ane o' our sma' mallins to the mains;
As far's the statliest broom outstrips the know,
'Boon ilka town Auld Reikie lifts her pow.

ROBIN.
But, man, in a' the earth what took ye there?

SYMON.
I gaed na errandless, ye needna speir:
My case was bad as yours, if naithing worse,
As teem my belly, an' as poor my purse.
The chamberlain rampaging for the rent,
Like baited bear on herrying me was bent;
But what was war than a' the rest had been,
I tint my saul on Jenny's thieving een;
'Twou'd mak your flesh creep on your banes, to hear
Her cruelties to me this last half-year;
At turning o' a strae she took the fling;
Whan I was dorty she was sure to sing.
Ae antran morn I met her at the creeve,
(I'll ne'er forget it to her while I live),
I mintit only anes to prie her mow:
"Swythe, mensless beast!  she says, an' kiss the sow."
GOD help the man that speirs an' dinna speed!
Troth Robin, she was like to be my dead;
I saw my hell was growing to a height;
I mather'd was a' day, an' mad a night.
Ae morning in a wooden dream I raise,
Took aff my beard, pat on my Sunday's claise,
Syne buckled round my plaid o' tartan hue,
Took bawty at my foot, nor bridle drew,
Till I the laird on Reikie's causey gat;
(Robie, there's mony a mile twixt this an' that);
I hail'd him first; he ca'd me by my name,
And ferley'd what fuish me sae far frae hame.
I told him a', and said, wi' wat'ry een,
I meant to gang awa an' ne'er be seen.
"Stop, Symon, stop, he says; I've heard enough;
Gang hame, my honest man!  an' streik the plough,
Tak tent again, an' byganes are forgiv'n,
For otherwise we canna win to heav'n."

ROBIN.
For sic a speech God had him lang his heal';
Thy're now thin sawn would tell you sic a tale;
Were a' our lairds but half as kind as he,
Sac mony would nae flock beyond the sea.

SYMON.
I ne'er had utteridge to mak a phrase,
Or dress a dish o' fyttings a' my days;
I mutter'd a short pray'r, an' took my leave,
Syne drank a gockiefu' to mak me steeve,
An' off I came:  I think I bedna lang
To hear the gilgal o' the brulying thrang.
Came hame, an' call'd at Eddie's as I past,
Sat down, and tauld him a' frae first to last:
The auld fowks heard me glad my tale descrive,
And Peggy was the happiest thing alive.
Frae that day forth my cares were unco sma',
An' soon in Peggy's smile I lost them a';
'Cause saucy Jenny slighted me whan poor,
I've sworn my foot shall never file her floor.

ROBIN.
Now wae gae by thee, Peggy, weil I kent
'Twas nae for nought sae mony sighs were spent;
On their ain stalk she watch'd the berries blue,
An' apples, red as her ain cheeks, for you.
Ae day she took me to the inmost know,
Stood lang, an' look'd about, an' claw'd her pow,
Syne ask'd me, wi' a sigh, gif I could say
Beyond what far aff hill Auld Reikie lay.
The woods, the wells, the greens wi' gowans bra,
Had naething sweet whan Symon was awa.

SYMON.
On man!  what pleasure is it to be free!
In Peggy's smile there's heav'n an' liberty.
As lang's I ken mysel I'll bless the laird,
An' yearly in the rig, the moss, or yard,
Sax days twice tald o' eidant wark I'll give,
An' 'fore the lady rin as lang's I live.

ROBIN.
Happy auld man!  ye naething ha'e to fear,
There's nane dare twin ye o' an inch o' gear,
Nor great nor sma' dare ask ye what ye do,
Or tak the pairing o' a rig frae you:
We're driven frae the houf o' our forbiers
That nurs'd us a' these mony hunner years.
I've toil'd mysel awa to skin an' bane,
An' Madge, till a' the earth grew red an' green,
Has mony a hungry day sat at her wheel,
Baith 'sham'd to beg, an' mair asham'd to steal!
Now stript of house an' haul, of horse and plough,
By ane wha thinks he never has enough;
We're forc'd for want at hame to tak the sea,
Or else to lie down at a dyke an' die.
Alas!  an ' fall a villain streik a foam,
Or saw ill-gotten feed in Robie's howm!
Alas!  that e'er a cullion's fusome greed
Should stain my hearth, a stranger yet to bleed.
Happy auld man!  whan I'm toss'd far awa,
Wi' hungar tint, or sinking in a jaw,
Here on the brent ye're lying wi' your sheep,
An' your ain bees are singan you asleep;
While o'er your head the linnet lilts her sang,
An' at your feet the bournie purls alang.

SYMON.
But, Robin, ken ye what airt ye're gaen?

ROBIN.
On, gaen! &mdash; I kenna, some say to Canaan,
An' some, whar men do ane ainither flea,
'Mang Turks as black as what I winna say.
Wi' all agust o' this my flesh a' grues;
Sic malagrugous cullions are nae mows:
But yet to bide whan wasted to the spaul,
Wou'd be like putting hand i' my ain saul:
Ae thing I well believe, I'll ne'er come back
About auld fairnyears wi' my friend to crack;
Sae God be wi' you, man!  what sun and moon
Drap frae the lift, and a' thir days are done,
At happier springs I hope we'll meet again,
Whar no proud laird dare rob us of our ain;
Till then may merriment your life attend;
Lang may his honour kythe your keenest friend!
May health an' hearty bannocks crown your toil;
Lang may you live, and lang may Peggy smile.

SYMON.
Na, Robin, na, this night we shanna part,
To-morrow's soon enough to break my heart,
I've cruds an' reem, an' ither things afouth
We'll eat upon the green for sake of scouth;
I'll o'er the gait for Eddie and the rest,
And her whase smile is sweeter than a feast.
Now ruddy evening kindles ilka stream;
The owsen frae the plough are wearing hame;
The reek now rises tyte frae ilke lum,
An' Browney frae the westart hills is come.
