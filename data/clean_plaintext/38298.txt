To you (deare Nimph) whose wit, and forme, exflames
A world of spirits, with wonder of your graces,
That (in their strength) pursew no higher ames,
Then how to give your bounties soveraigne places.
I heere am bolde, to make extent of will,
Though not of power.  Pardon my first essay:
I goe by night, now to the Muses hill:
But I may live, to drinke there, at Mid-day.
O then:  my soule shall flow through my cleare vaines,
And (taking light from your bright vertues spheare)
Pay richer duties, in farre-sweeter straines,
Tun'd to your worth, and set to every eare.
Had I a Spencers spirit, a Daniels powers:
Th' extracted quintessence were only yours.
