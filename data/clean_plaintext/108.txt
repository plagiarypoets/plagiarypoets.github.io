If ALEXANDER sighed when he came
Unto the Tomb where fierce ACHILLES lay:
If he had cause, that blessed age to blame
Since HOMER lacks his merites to display.
If he with teares his sorrowes did bewray,
To see his father PHILIP conquer all,
And that more Worlds behinde there did not stay,
Which for reward of his deserts might fall:
Then may I mone, our times, our judgement small,
Unworthy records of your sacred skill:
Then must our Poets on new Muses call,
To graunt them guifts to imitate your quill.
I like the flie, that burneth in the flame,
Should shew my blindnes to attempt the same.
