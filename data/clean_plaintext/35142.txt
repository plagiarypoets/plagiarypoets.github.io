Sweet are the tuneful murmurs of the spring,
Gurgling from yon high oak's incumbent base,
Whose roots around the mossy fragments cling;
Whose dark brown branches wave with savage grace;
Sweet o'er their pebbly bed with silent pace
Through the green sloping banks the waters glide,
While the pale moon beholds her beauteous face
In the clear mirror of the glassy tide:
To that calm breast where peace and joy reside,
What heavenly raptures might these scenes impart!
And yet to his, where brooding sorrows hide
Their serpent stings, and point the venom'd dart,
They add, alas!  nor pleasure nor relief,
But cast in deeper shades the gloom of grief.
