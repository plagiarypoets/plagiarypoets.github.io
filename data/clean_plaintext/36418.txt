Domestic Love!  not in proud palace halls
Is often seen thy beauty to abide;
Thy dwelling is in lowly cottage walls,
That in the thickets of the woodbine hide;
With hum of bees around, and from the side
Of woody hills some little bubbling spring,
Shining along thro' banks with harebells dyed;
And many a bird to warble on the wing,
When Morn her saffron robe o'er heaven and earth doth fling.

O!  love of loves! &mdash; to thy white hand is given
Of earthly happiness the golden key!
Thine are the joyous hours of winter's Even,
When the babes cling around their father's knee;
And thine the voice, that on the midnight sea
Melts the rude mariner with thoughts of home,
Peopling the gloom with all he longs to see.
Spirit!  I've built a shrine; and thou hast come,
And on its altar closed &mdash; for ever closed thy plume!
