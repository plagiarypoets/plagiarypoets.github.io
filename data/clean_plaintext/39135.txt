On the banks of the sweet flowing Tay
A shepherd desponding reclin'd;
Poor Damon, alas!  (he did say),
You may die now, since Delia's unkind:
When I liv'd in her favour before,
Fair peace did my moments employ;
She has left me, and what have I more
That can give either pleasure or joy?

Ah!  how could I think the fair maid
Would deign to so humble a swain,
When so many gay shepherds invade,
And follow her over the plain?
My flock's all the treasure I have,
And a small one, with others compar'd:
I was pleas'd with what Providence gave,
And its favour most thankfully shar'd.

But since Delia deserted the vale,
My sheep all neglected do stray,
And my pipe, that enliven'd the dale,
I have thrown as quite useless away.
Ye warblers that tune the soft strain,
And chant it along every bough,
I pray you your music refrain,
I've no taste for your melody now.

My bleaters, your pasture forego,
And soothe my complaint with your cries;
And, ye breezes that gently do blow,
Indulge a reply to my sighs;
And Delia, oh!  hear my last wish,
While I breathe, it must center in you;
A more opulent swain may you bless,
But you never can find one more true.
