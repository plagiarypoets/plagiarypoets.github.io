With unharmonious voice may I presume
To hail thy orient beam, fair child of heaven?
In whose gay train are seen
The rosy-winged hours
That yoke the fiery steeds to Phoebus' car:
While thunder clothes their necks, the living flame
From their wide nostrils bursts,
In glory terrible.
Meek-ey'd Aurora!  thine the hour of prime:
Th' ambrosial dews are thine:  the modest blush
Whose sweetly-waving glow
Crimsons thy virgin cheek,
Excels the brightness of the noon-tide ray.
Revering thy approach, pale Night retires,
With all her gloomy train
Of shades and spectres dire.
Soon as thy jocund light proclaims the day,
And silvers o'er the green hill's lofty head,
Upsoars the chearful lark;
Sweet fav'rite of the dawn!
Towering above the safron-skirted clouds,
And lost to sight amid the deeps of air,
With native warblings wild
He welcomes thy return.
Then from the plain, where all night long they roam'd,
Their solitary haunts the fearful tribes
With cautious steps explore,
To wait the hour of eve.
Rejoicing in thy influence, from the cot,
Where health and vigour dwell, the shepherd springs,
And from the watled fold
Leads forth his bleating flock.
While with the lively sound of oaten reed,
And graceful heart, he joins the hymn of Morn,
Beneath thy sacred eye
The Muses raise their song,
As lightly o'er the lilied lawn they trip,
Or by the clear stream's winding banks they rove;
While on the breathing mead
The village-maid appears.
Fairer by far than all the flowers that deck
Its fragrant bosom with the hues of spring,
All hail, O lovely Queen!
Propitious to my vows,
Allow me to behold thy pleasing face,
And bless me with thy heart-reviving smiles:
Then often shall my lyre
Exulting hymn thy praise.
