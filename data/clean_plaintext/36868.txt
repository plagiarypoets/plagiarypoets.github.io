Whyleare great Zeus from the Olympian throne
Look'd downe, and mortalls thus bespeaking cryed,
"Lo here the Worlde!  take itt, it is youre owne,
And soe yee brotherlye the same dyvyde,
Tis your's for aye, whatever chaunce betyde."
Ne young, ne old, but then incontinent,
To winne him joyaunce and fair fortune hide;
Flowers and fruites ywis the labourer hent
Whiles chasyng through the grove the youthe aye fearlesse went.

The merchaunt then he store-houses 'gan fille,
His barnes the farmer, and his vattes the prieste;
The king yspake, "Lette eache man have his wille,
And take what lykes him beste from this rich feaste,
So shalle my taxes bee stille more yncreased."
Now when long time all had dyvyded beene,
Appeared the Poet from the distaunt easte:
Pardie!  ne ought but had its Lord, I ween,
And in no place around could aught for him be seen!

"Now woe betyde, and am I then alone,
Of all withaulten from thy souvenaunce,
Whom thou as deareste sonne whyleare didst owne!"
Soe burste hee forth in cryes of doloraunce,
And at Jove's feet 'gan weep his sad mischaunce.
"Mee blame not," said the God, "that thou delayed,
From thy fonde londe of dreames betymes t' advaunce,
Where tarried thou whiles mortalls forby made,
Dyvysion of the Earthe?"  "With thee," the Poet saide.

"Upon thy face resplendant hung myne eyne,
Thy Heaven's harmonie entraunced my ear,
Oh, pardon!  that amiddes thy lighte divine
My soule yrapt, forgat the earthlie sphere!"
"Deare sonne," quoth Jove, "how may I soothe thy dreare?
Chase, market, harvest, ne ought else I see,
Are longer mine to give; then wilt thou here
With mee in Heaven abide, I promise thee
Henceforth, whene'er thou come, the entraunce shall be free."
