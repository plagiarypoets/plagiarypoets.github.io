Once I beheld, &mdash; how dear to memory's eye
Nature's wild scenes improved by novelty!&mdash;
The vernal tempest Arran's summits hide,
Move, sternly-low'ring, o'er the troubled Clyde,
Deepen the gloom of Cowal's hills of heath,
And wave his terrors over green Rosneath,
From Leven's laughing vale each charm exile,
And pour his wrarth on many a trembling isle.

Yet one fair islet scorn'd his fierce career,&mdash;
Her fields unshadowed and her fountains clear,
As if his radiant shield some angel cast
O'er her young foliage, 'wept the tempest past.
Safe from the gusts that ravaged  hill and dale,
The waves rough-rolling, and the arrowy hail,
She smiled in loveliness, and on her breast
The storm-chased sunbeams found a place of rest.

Bright shone that isle amid the flashing foam,
But brighter, lovelier far, to me is Home.
