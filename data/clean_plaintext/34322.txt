See how the sable-vested Night,
That holds divided Reign with Light,
Warn'd by the Moon's reviving Ray,
Comes from her gloomy Bow'rs away.

Flagrant upon her Raven-Brows
The Sleep-procuring Poppy glows;
And from her copious Horn are shed
The Dews soft-gliding o'er the Mead.

The Flow'rs their silken Leaves unfold,
Leaves ting'd with Azure, Green, and Gold,
And wait till Morn her Sway resumes,
To scent the Gale with fresh Perfumes.

ZEPHYR, his wanton Wings repress'd,
On Earth's soft Bosom sinks to Rest;
Ev'n quiv'ring Aspins cease to blow,
Nor can the Stream a Dimple show.

Slow-moving down the ecchoing Hill,
Self-pleas'd to chant his Wood-notes shrill,
The Shepherd drives his bleating Train,
To fold them on the furrow'd Plain.

Hark!  from yon Bush-entangled Vale
The loud-complaining Nightingale
Trills her thick-warbled Ditty o'er,
But never ends her tuneful Store.

Daughter of HARMONY  and NIGHT,
Thy Strains afford such rich Delight,
As NATURE Thee her Minstrel chose
To charm her Labours to Respose.

Stay, sweetest PHILOMEL, and chear
The solitary Pilgrim's Ear,
Till Morn, in orient Gold array'd,
Awakes the Tenants of the Shade.

The Sun has now forsook the Sky,
But still with many a beauteous Dye
Inflames the West; and, edg'd with Light,
Comes shad'wing on the Veil of Night.

Such may my Eve of Life appear!
Such Smiles may Death's kind Visage wear!
While I serene, secure from Harms,
In Transports sink into his Arms.

Now from the op'ning Gates of Heav'n
HESPER the flaming Sign has giv'n
For all his num'rous Host to trim
Their golden Fires, and ride with him.

Fast-trickling Mists my Limbs invade,
And the Night forms a duskier Shade:
Come, finish with the setting Sun,
And with him rise, and with him run.
