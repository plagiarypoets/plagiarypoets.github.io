Insatiate despot, whose resistless arm
Shatters the loftiest fabric to its base,
Who steals from Beauty every magic charm,
And robs proud nature of her loveliest grace,
'Tis thine to reconcile the troubled breast,
To prove that sublunary joys are vain,
To turn from pomp the tinsel of her train,
And seek the silent paths of mental rest:
So from the deadliest poison, chymic art
Extracts a healing balm to tranquilize the heart.
