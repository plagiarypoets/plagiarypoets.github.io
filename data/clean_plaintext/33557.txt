Collin my Master, O Muse sound his praise,
Extoll his never to be equal'd Layes,
Who thou dost Imitate with all thy might,
As he did once in Chawcers veine delight,
And thy new Faerie King, shall with Queen,
When thou art dead, still flourish ever green.
Cease wealthy Italy to brag and boast,
That thou for Poesie art famed most
Of any Nation, Ariosto's veine,
Though rare, came short of our great Spencers streine:
His great Orlando hath receiv'd great losse
By Spencers Faerie Knight of the Red Cross.
Warrelike Rogeros honour clouded is
By his Arthegall, and much fame doth misse,
His sweet Angellica describ'd with Art,
Is wan and withered, to his Brittomart,
His admirable Poem darkned quite,
As if he onely had known how to write,
Nor may that wonder of your Nation claime
Supremacie, before our Spencers Fame:
Admired Tasso, (pardon) I must do
That right the Muses all perswade me to,
Although to Godfery by thy worthy Layes,
Thou dost a Mausolean Trophey rasie,
Yet Spencer to Eliza hath done more,
And by his fullnesse lesseneth thy store:
He like the grand Meonian sits on high,
Making all Verse stoope to his Poesie;
Like to some mighty River Nile or Po,
All that obstruct him, hee'l soon overthrow:
And shallow Brooks, if any list to strive,
From forth his Ocean soon they may derive.
Hee next unto Apollo sits above
With Homer, and sweet Maro, who approve
Of his society, and joy to see
Him that did equall their fam'd Poesie.
Niggardly Nation be asham'd of this,
A Tombe for thy great Poet wanting is,
While fooles, not worth the naming, seated high
On Sepulchers of Marble God-like lie:
The learned in obscurity are thrust,
But yet their Names shall long out-live their dust:
Although Great Spencer they did thee interre,
Not Rearing to thy name a Sepulcher,
Yet thou hast one shall last to the last day,
Thy Faerie Queen, which never shall decay:
This is a Poets Priviledge, although
His person among sordid dolts do goe
Unto the Grave, his Name shall ever live,
And spite of Time, or Malice shall survive.
