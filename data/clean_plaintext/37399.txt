The Shades of waning Night had now begun,
To feel the near approaches of the Sun;
Melting they mov'd, and softly stole away,
For Now a Beam of Light began to Play,
The Nimble Index of the Rising Day:
When my Tir'd Soul some little Respit Found,
Jaded with Busie Thought's Eternal round;
Dissolv'd it lay, and Nodding in my Breast,
Sunk into Ease, and Softned into Rest.

What art thou Sleep?  How cam'st thou to Controul,
The Thought of Man, thou Lethe of the Soul?
Rais'd, when the Mind for Action is Unfit,
And Dulness Triumphs in the Room of Wit:
When Mimick Notions are by Fancy Wrought,
Deluding from it's Track the wand'ring Thought;
False Flatt'rer Thou, who didst my Care Deride,
Thou Down-hill Ease, to all the World beside:
Kind Sleep I thought, would Rid me of my Pain,
Fondly I thought, for Lo a Dismal Scene,
Restor'd me to my Grief, and to my Self again.

Enlarg'd from Clay my nimble Spirit past,
O'er the vast Deep, and all the wat'ry Waste;
Fair Albion's Soil, with Flying Steps I Tread;
Sweep o'er the Lawns, and Skim along the Mead:
Albion, the Theam of ev'ry Shepherds Song;
Albion, for ever Great, for ever Young;
Laught in Her Flowers, and in Her Pastur's smil'd:
But now She seems Deserted by Her Swains,
No Pipe, no Voice, no Musick on the Plains;
Her Wond'ring Nymphs, gaz'd on me from a far,
And Shreiking cry'd, What would'st thou Stranger here?
Forsaken are Our Fields, and every Grove,
Ceas'd are Our Pastimes, and Our Tales of Love;
Fly, Stranger Fly, back to your Native Shore,
All Joy is Fled from hence, and Softness is no more.

A Hollow Cavern struck My wondring Sight,
Awful, and Rev'rend, it it's Native Night;
Husht was the drowsie Gloom, no Voice was there,
To Charm, or to Molest the listning Ear:
O'er-grown with Moss it seem'd, and Moist the Ground,
Silence, and Empty Solitude around.

'Twas here the Pensive, Sad Britannia sat,
T' indulge Her Grief, and Mourn Her Hero's Fate;
Agast She Look't, once so Divinely Fair,
Loose were Her Robes, and Matted was Her Hair:
Her Mourning Vail, hung down with careless Grace,
And Soiling Dust deform'd Her Beauteous Face;
Each Nymph to Chear the Mourning Goddess Tries,
Whilst Fixt on Earth, She kept Her Heavenly Eyes:
Neglected is their Voice, and ev'ry Strain,
Each Tuneful Cadence melts away in Vain;
In Vain do's all the Liquid Musick creep,
Of Murm'ring Streams, inviting Easy sleep:
Officious Winds around Her Temples Play,
And Birds in sweet Complaints are Vain as they;
To Lull Her grief no Melody was Found,
Too far the Arrow went, Too deep the Wound:
Her Sighs were heard o'er all the Neighb'ring Plain,
And Hollow Rocks sigh'd back to Her again.

After a Gentle Pause &mdash; Her head She rears,
Fair in Her Grief, Majestick in Her Tears;
And sighing Spoke&mdash;

BRITANNIA.
Where am I?  what, in these sad Realms again,
To know new Wo, and everlasting Pain;
To Fields of Peace, I seem'd to take my Way,
Unkind, to call Me back to hateful Day:
Forbear ye Nymphs, your cruel kindness cease,
My Soul is out of Tune, nor looks for Peace;
Can ye, ah can ye to My breast restore,
That calm of Mind which I possesst before:
I have been happy, Witness all ye Pow'rs,
Who guided with your Smiles My easy Hours;
Their Homage pay'd, and own'd Me for their Queen:
Far Distant Indies brought their Wealthy store,
T' enrich My Land, and Crown My happy Shoar;
In Rounds of Bliss My dancing Minutes past,
In Bliss, too great to [missing text], too Feirce to Last:
Short was it's Reign, and little was it's Stay,
For Oh!  too soon the Mist swept oe'r the face of day
Which spread it's Beamy Wings and shot away;
The guilded Vision vanisht from My sight,
And leaves Me to the horror of the Night;
She say'd &mdash; Her mourning Nymphs sigh all around,
And Neighb'ring Hills return'd their dying Sound.

I'll think no more She Cry's, for Thought's Unkind,
Madness shall Calm this Tempest of My mind;
Oh!  Balm of Feav'rish Souls, Oh!  sure Relief,
Come sooth the Working of My stormy Grief:
Whirle of the Brain, be quick and give Me Ease,
Oh!  Drive Me from the Thought of what I was;
Or if Thought needs will Play, it be My care,
T' admit no Object but My Hero there:
Teach me some Pow'r Divine, who only can,
Instruct me how to Sing the Wond'rous man;
Vast is the Task, and mighty is the Theam,
And Let my Song prove Equal to his Fame.

If, wildring in a maze of Endless strife,
Cloy'd with that Painted Scene of Pleasure, Life;
Our Friends their utmost Debt to Nature pay,
Dropping behind this Pondrous lump of Clay:
W' adorn their Hearse, and sweetest Odours Burn,
And with Our pious Wo, perfume their Urn;
What Vast accumulated Grief is due?
What tributary Tears?  my Great NASSAW, to You:
To whom Kind Heav'n, as in peculiar care,
Gave all the Beauties of it's happy Sphere,
And Coppy'd by the noblest Image there:
With ev'ry Charm, and ev'ry Beauty grac'd,
Heav'n ev'n was lavish grown and Bounteous to a waste;
On the nice Ridge of Vertue's path you trod,
Belov'd of Man, and thankful to your God:
Thankfull, for Kindred beauty's of the mind,
For Kings are Gods &mdash; tho' of a lesser kind;
Firm in your Purpose, faithful to your Trust,
For as He made you wise, He made you just:
For fixt as Fate, your Royal Promise stood,
And what your Mouth had said, your Arm made good;
In bounty most Immense you joy'd to shine,
In lavish Bounty, which ressembles mine:
You took the Noblest, yet most secret way,
Obliging Wretches who could never pay;
True Bounty without all design is giv'n,
Returns are Poor from Man, when pay'd to Kings or Heav'n.
What Old Creating Bard at once could sing,
A States-Man, yet a Saint, a Hero, and a King;
Such diff'rent Glory's do but seldom shine,
Fixt in a single Breast, and could be only thine:
Pois'd with it's weight unerring Judgment sway'd,
Your World of Man, and to your Soul convey'd
The motives which in various Channels flow,
Sprung from variety of minds below:
You knew the vast distinctions that arise,
Between the Great, the Pious, and the Wise;
Knew, that when Honour is a guilded cheat,
A Masque for Vice, a Tympany of State,
That 'tis Egregious folly to be great;
That Virtue can the noblest Title bring,
Virtue exalts, but Vice Dethrones a King,
As a bright Glass, in which all Shapes appear,
Unspotted as your Fame, and as your Image fair;
Whose vast Reflection dims the tender sight,
And blinds Beholders with excess of light:
Pure was the Christal motion of your mind,
From Error's speck enlightned, and refin'd:
With such too powerful rays my WILLIAM shone,
Fierce in the Field &mdash; but humble on the Throne;
Careful in Thought the wretched to relieve,
Swift to spy Faults &mdash; but swifter to forgive.

With soft Compassion toucht, the Hero stood,
Nor thought it glorious to be smear'd with Blood;
No boiling rage His even Temper shook,
He sought with Vigour, but with pity strook:
To Heav'n He meant His Piety to shew,
Ceasing to stab it's Image in His Foe;
For Hero's who the spoils of Conquest wear,
And sternly think 'tis Womanish to spare,
Are but the nobler Butchers of the War.

As a calm River which do's gently creep,
Whose whispers seem to Lull it's Waves asleep;
His Passions kept their banks, nor knew to flow,
But ebbing in His Soul subsided all below:
Fading as Tapers Master'd by the light,
Harmless as Beamless Fires that play by Night;
Prest down within His breast enchain'd they lay,
And at His reason's glitter dyed away.
As in the highest Reason of the Air,
Plac'd far above our sight, Divinely clear;
Coelestial matter is not forc'd to know,
The Tempests that distract the World below:
Blest was His Mind with such a round of Ease,
An everlasting Still, and calm of Peace:
Calm as red Evenings in their Dewey tears,
Mild, as a blooming Innocence appears:
Soft, as the whispers of a Virgin love,
No Waves could rustle, nor a Tempest move;
Modest in doubt, but Positive in right,
Slow to do wrong, &mdash; Tho' active as the Light:
Whom Justice bound, His Royal pity spares,
He try'd with Rigour, but condemn'd with Tears;
No specious Wile His Soul could lead astray,
But when his Reason pointed out the way,
He swiftly follow'd, and could first obey.

Such WILLIAM was, but Oh!  that Heav'nly light,
Shrunk into silent Shades, and setts in Night;
He was &mdash; but is no more, come, Virgins come,
And with your Tears bedew the Hero's Tomb:
Let loose your Grief, and weep to that Degree,
Till melting into Streams, ye all dissolve like me.
She said &mdash; Unusual wailings fill the Air,
Her mourning Nymphs lament, Their Garments tear,
And to the sighing Winds spread out their Yellow Hair;
In floods of Grief my strugling Passions rise,
But sleep denied the Tribute of my Eyes:
Thus when of Joy, we slumb'ring do partake,
Fain we would utter Words, but cannot speak,
Our Passions seem too Great to be Exprest,
But heaving for a Vent lie strugling in our Breast.

Amaz'd I saw Britannia's Accents rise,
Wafted by Gales of sighs to Touch the Skyes;
Where bright Angelick minds admiring sat,
The strange meanders of Fantastick Fate;
And seem'd to Mourn, (as far as Angels can)
The short-liv'd Glory of unhappy Man.

When lo!  a Deluge of Aetherial light,
Pour'd down, and overflow'd my akeing sight;
The Golden Doors of Heav'n were open Thrown,
And with a sudden blaze th' affrighted Aether shone.

Immortal Seraphins Divinely fair,
Mantl'd in Sable Clouds, shot swiftly thro' the Air;
Th' affrighted Earth leapt back, it's Goddess fled,
And at her Center, shook her wond'ring Head:
For much she fear'd th' Eternal would restore,
Her sway to ancient Night, which Govern'd all before.

Trembling I gaz'd a while, and saw from far,
All dreadful to behold the Thund'ring God of War;
Red light'ning from his Fiery Eye-balls flew,
Terror, with Sorrow mixt, sat sow'ring on his Brow:
His Casque, and Spear attending Warriors Bore,
His Lions paw'd the Air, and loudly seem'd to roar;
Swiftly they drew his Iron Chariot on,
Which with a Crashing sound came wheeling down.

The God of Battle, and his Warrior Train,
In Mournful pomp Stalkt silent o'er the Plain;
Sheath'd were their Swords, and useless was the Shield,
Unmown the Iron Harvest of the Field:
O'erthrown the Trophys which were rais'd before,
Beat down by advers Fate, since WILLIAM is no more;
The dying sounds Britannia did Impart,
Had pierc'd the daring Hero to the Heart:
Reclining on His Shield He thus addrest,
Whilst all the God in sighs sat heaving in His breast.

MARS.
Oh!  Goddess, cease your Hero's loss to mourn,
The binding Seal of Fate is on His Urn,
Just was your Grief, nor could you less have shewn,
Too well I guess your loss, who know my own,
What Muse can paint the life?  What God can sing?
The Triumphs of your late Victorious King:
The City's taken, and the Battles won,
By the successful Arms of Great NASSAW my Son;
Who Death in fighting Fields Undaunted saw,
Stretching from Pole to Pole, and kept the World in awe:
Such was I, when Gigantick War assail'd,
Heav'ns steepy Turrets, and had nigh prevail'd;
Had not I Mars come Thund'ring from afar,
To front the Brawniest Hero's of the War:
Pleas'd to Exert my strength, and proud to prove,
The Buckler of the Gods, and shield of Jove;
The Toughest of the Foe this Arm has slain,
And dragg'd his Monstrous Body o'er the Plain:
Whilst Fate was ours, tho' mighty ruin hurl'd,
Mountain on Mountain thrown, and World on World.

Methinks his Squadrons I descry from far,
Oh!  Energy Divine, Oh!  Glorious Dinn of War;
His Phalanx moves, I hear the loud alarms,
That startle Fate, and shake the Globe with Arms:
Clad in refulgent Steel the Hero shines,
And darts a Martial vigour thro' the Lines;
A Heav'nly Luster, and a Manly Grace,
Spring from his Limbs, and lighten in his Face:
So lookt Acchilles, when with Sprightly Joy,
He fell'd the Atlas, of Unhappy Troy:
My Arms, my Arms, I'll mount th' Immortal Carr,
And share at least the Glory of the War;
And see thro' Fields of Blood we jointly Trace,
Now by my Arms, he Foils me in the race
And scorns of Mars himself, to take a second Place;
They Fly, they Fly, nor can their Ground make good,
In vain the Boyne opposes with it's Flood;
Thro' Lanes of watry War, he cuts his way,
Waves, Winds, and Seas, are Impotent as they:
His Spear is Fate, for when he means a blow,
He Hurls th' unerring Goddess on the Foe.

The Scene shifts quick, and see the City stands,
With lofty Turrets Crown'd, and all the Plain Commands;
They bolt their Brazen Gates, our Passage barr,
And with loud shouts provoke us to the War:
Vainly ye boast your strength, we come, we come,
Sound the shrill Trump of War, and beat the Martial Drum;
Oh!  Heav'nly noise &mdash; on Britains, fiercely on,
Follow your Hero all and force the Town:
The Clanck of Arms begins, an Millions fall,
A Ladder straight prepare, I'll scale the Wall;
Follow, my Son, and Albion's Genius shew,
He mounts, and upwards Darts upon the Foe:
Whole heaps of Slain, are round the Hero spread,
And Thousand Shaft's of Fate sing round his Head;
Huge pond'rous Stones, the sweating Warriors wield
And hurle the Rocky Quarry on his Shield:
By such inglorious Fate he shall not fall,
I'll bear him in my Arms, and fix him on the Wall;
Ha!  by the War they Fly, nor dare to stand,
He Portions Fate out with a lavish Hand;
The Gate's unbarr'd, the joyful Troops rush in,
And the rough Waste of Conquerors begin;
Wide desolation spreads it self around,
Dreadful the cry, Amazing is the sound:
Death Rides elated o'er the purple Flood,
And with Malicious joy besmears his Limbs with Blood;
With Ecchoing shouts the Vaulted Arches ring,
Whilst the glad Britains, Io Paean sing,
And Crown with Lawrels their Victorious King.

So Gay in Camps my WILLIAM did appear,
Such was his Vigour, such His Thirst of War;
But Oh!  whom neither War nor Hell could Bow,
Too Rigid Fate, he humbly bent to you:
You Mow'd the Harvest which His Glories yield,
And prest the Gen'rous Vintage of the Field;
Well may'st Thou boast that Thou too strong could'st prove,
You who surmount, and Rule the will of Jove.
What?  Pale my Warrior, all Thy Glories fled,
Thy Triumphs at an end; all pale, and dead;
Oh!  could not all thy matchless Prowess save,
And snatch thy much lov'd Body from the Grave:
Oh Britains!  raise each Man his pondrous Shield,
And bear your dauntless Hero to the Field;
In dumb Distress March slowly to the Plain,
And weep, as ye had there beheld him slain:
Of Arms, and massy Shields a Trophy raise,
Sound with the Voice of War, the Hero's Praise;
Unusual Honours to His Ghost be pay'd,
Honours Divine, befit the Mighty Dead:
Then, springing from His Tomb depose your Care,
Dye all your sorrows, all your Thoughts be War;
Oh!  taste, and know the Pleasure of Alarms,
Rouse up my Sons, and give your Soul to Arms:
To Arms, the Glorious Path that I have Trod;
To Arms, that Shoot a Hero to a God;
Scorn, scorn the Circe of a Sluggish Peace,
To Boys and Women leave inglorious Ease;
Think on the Honours which your Arms have won,
And think 'tis Mars and William lead ye on:
And let Each Hero, who would Glorious be,
Dare to a Height, and Merit Heav'n like me.
He say'd&mdash;

To Arms was heard, the dreadful Word was giv'n,
Which seem'd to Rend the Earth, and Shake the Arch of Heav'n;
My bursting Spirits cou'd scarce their Limits keep,
But had nigh loos'd the brittle Chains of Sleep:
Till the soft Accents of a Heavn'ly Strain,
Had Gently sooth'd them into Rest again;
A Lambent Glory spread it self around,
Bleaching with Snowy Beams the smiling Ground:
When Lo!  a Gay Machine appear'd in sight,
All Gilt, and Studd'd o're with Rays of light;
Slowly it mov'd, and downward took it's Way,
Around the crowding Cherubs seem'd to Play,
And sang the Praises of the God of Day:
Plac'd at their Patron's Feet, the sacred Nine,
Warbled Melodious Airs on Flutes Divine;
Old Hoary Time upon His right Hand sat,
An Hour-glass by, and Wings upon His Feet,
The Months and Weeks upon the left appear,
The nimble Minutes, and th' Hours were there,
The swift Attendants of the Rowling Year:
His Golden Harp across His shoulder Hung,
His Arrows broken, and His Bow unstrung;
His Beamy locks the awful Glory shook,
And turning to his Train the God of Wisdom spoke.

APOLLO.
The Sum of fair Britannia's Grief ye see,
Ye know the cruel Cause, and Mourn it all with me;
Y' Immortal Nine, your Tuneful Voices raise,
And hush her sorrows with Harmonious Lays:
Such as of Old the Thracian Bard began,
When Nature danc'd to the Melodious Man;
Each Tree around it's Shady branches spread,
And Nodding to the sound, declin'd it's Head:
Wild Beasts upon the Heav'nly Accents hung,
And ceas'd to harm, as softned by His Song;
Leave, leave the Shepherds to their Shady Groves,
To Sigh, and Pine for their Neglected Loves:
A Nobler Subject Claims your Heav'nly Song,
WILLIAM from Hero's, and Immortals sprung;
Trace him ye Sisters from his Earliest Growth,
From His first dawn of Day, to ruddy Youth:
Sing how His fiercest Foes were forc'd to yield,
When the young Warrior beat the Dusty Field;
What Hero's by his Infant hand were slain,
Who stood the Great Goliahs of the Plain.

Sing, how when Tyranny Fair Albion knew,
And to a servile Yoke was forc'd to Bow;
Markt out for Greatness by th' Eternal's Mind,
He stood the Atlas of his Will design'd:
Terrour and Ruin round her Foes he spread,
Fought all her Battles, all her Armies led;
Fast bound in Chains inconstant Chance was Borne,
To Grace his Triumphs, and his Pomp adorn:
She learn'd to bend, beneath the Hero's Will,
Who fixt the Whirling motion of her Wheel;
Fixt by Necessity, she knew 'twas Vain,
To knaw the Links of her Eternal Chain,
Which Serpents like divides, to Reunite again:
Now sing of Jarring Seeds the swift Decrease,
Sooth'd to a Calm, and husht into a Peace;
Rough Wars unarm'd, and Thunders now no more,
But hears the Hero's Voice, and Flyes the Shoar:
Who clear'd the Mists, and with His Pow'rful Ray,
Dispell'd the Gloom, and gave again the Day.

So when the God of Winds lets loose his Train,
To Plough the Deep, and furrow up the Main;
Swell'd with their Breath, the foaming Billows rise,
And with a Frothy Mountain mate the Skyes:
Till the Great Father of the Flood appears,
And o're the Deep his Peaceful Visage rears;
The Blust'ring Tyrants dare no longer stay,
But on their Wat'ry Pinions sweep away:
Each Wave unbends its Rage, and Foams no more,
But in a Gentle Curle, runs Circling to the Shoare.

Tune, tune your Harps, and all your Airs Improve,
To sing the transports, and the sweets of Love;
Describe the Eden of Maria's Breast:
Sing all the Beauties of Her Blooming Youth,
Immortal Candor, Piety, and Truth;
The structure of her Body so Refin'd,
It pervious seem'd to sight, Transparent as Her mind:
So nice the Case was workt, the Weft so thin,
The pure unspotted Soul appear'd within;
Paint Her white World of Charms, and ev'ry Grace,
Dwell on each Feature of Maria's Face:
Fair as the Light, when Infant Nature smil'd,
And Heav'n, and Earth lookt Gay, and all was Mild;
When the first rounds of Golden Time began,
The Beauteous Female She; and He the happy Man.

But Oh!  prepare a yet more peircing Strain,
And with its shriller Accents fill the Plain;
In harsher Notes of thrilling Musick tell,
How Mourn'd by all that's fair the Beauteous Angel fell.

With soft'ning Touches Paint the Hero there,
Melting in Floods of Grief, and wild Despair;
Describe His Trobbing Breast, His Gales of sighs,
His foulded Arms across, His dying Eyes:
Upon His Lips what Mournful Accents hung,
What melting pity Flow'd out of His Tongue;
From His swoln Heart, what streaming Sorrow ran,
Which all bedew'd the Melancholy Man.

Now, sing the Blessings of His even Sway,
Who wisely knew 'twas Dangerous to stray,
Too near extreams, and kept the middle Way;
And, as the Father of the Gods appears,
Weighing the Fate of Man, and Period of His Years:
What great Aeneas must a Conquest gain?
Or what Ill fated Turnus press the Plain?
What wondrous Acts must Albion's Fame Advance?
And What Ill boading Ruin waits on France?
Such Careful Thoughts appear'd on WILLIAM'S Brow,
When with Impartial Hands He Portion'd Fate below;
Measuring Desert with nicety of Span,
Nor weigh'd exteriour Honours, but the Man:
No Glitt'ring shew of Greatness could prevail,
Merit alone could turn the dubious Scale;
The dangers sing, thro' which his Arms have run,
To save His Country, and deserve a Crown,
Yet with what ease He lay'd the Conquest down:
Calm was His End, no hurricane of Soul,
His last and Whitest Minutes could Controul;
He blest the hand from which His Soul was ta'en,
And in a Gentle sigh pay'd back the Debt again.

So a dim Taper in its Wane of Light,
Gilds with it's latest Rays the Bosom of the Night;
Faint in its Beams, the Flame around it Plays,
And hovers o're it with Contracted Rays:
Till on its Pallid Wings it upward Flyes,
And spireing to a point, gives a bright Flash and Dyes.

He say'd &mdash; the Tuneful Nine in Chorus sing,
The Wars and Triumphs of Britannia's King;
Charm'd with the Airs, and Ravisht with the sound,
M' Enchanted Spirits danc'd a nimble round;
But when by Turns they sang His latest Breath,
And how His rising Suns had sett in Death:
At Each sad Accent of the killing Strains,
My Friezing Blood scarce dropt within my Veins;
Each dismal Note had pierc'd my tendrest part,
Heav'd in my Soul, and sunk into my Heart;
The Musick ceas'd&mdash;

When Lo!  substantial darkness seem'd to rise,
Prodigious Thunder ratling in the Skyes;
Heav'n, Earth, and Air, caught up on sudden Wings,
Stood all confest in sight before the King of Kings:
All radiant bright with Diamond Stars, all beamy like the Sun;
Drunk with a Flood of Light I trembling Gaze,
Whilst a pale Terrour sat on ev'ry Face:
O're all the Earth a solemn hush was spread,
Silence like that which rules among the Dead.

When Mighty Jove who with a single Span,
Measures the Earth, the little Realm of Man;
Who thro' the void the kindling Atoms hurl'd,
Those Seeds of life, which form'd the Infant World:
Deep fixt in thought, Majestically Nods,
And rising from His Throne, thus spoke the King of Gods.

JUPITER.
Wide as th' Abbys m' Almighty will is spread,
Vast as the spacious Kingdoms of the Dead;
Unknown my Path, inscrutable my Ways,
For who dares tread the round of an Eternal maze:
Yet Man, weak Man, with Reason's weaker line,
Would sound my Thoughts, and fathom my Design;
Whilst Gross Opinion with it's puzling light,
Misleads him darkling in Eternal Night:
Amaz'd he stands to see th' Impartial Grave,
Treat both alike the Coward, and the Brave;
That Hero's by the Hand of Fate are Slain,
And Demi-gods return to Earth again.

Not so my WILLIAM, in whose blooming Youth,
I Sow'd the Seeds of Everlasting Truth;
Humbly He lay'd down Life, and ceas'd to be,
And dy'd to all the World, to live with me:
He wisely argu'd it a fair remove,
To quit a Kingdom for the Breast of Jove;
I lookt within my self and drew the Plann,
To raise the structure of that Wond'rous Man:

When Urg'd by Fire, Coelestial Mettals Glow
For Forms, to be allay'd in Clay below;
Around the Mint, my Vulgar Angels stand,
Each Puny Pow'r Creates to try His Infant hand:
But when His oar was in the Cauldron thrown,
Whole Jove was then Imploy'd, the Work was all my own
My care the Royal Bullion did Refine,
Thrice did I breath, and gave a Treble spark of Energy Divine:
T' enrich His Soul I Ransact all my Store,
And fill'd the Vessel with Immortal Oar;
Half drown'd in Liquid Good, till it could hold no more:
Thro' wond'rous Toils He like Alcides ran,
Born to keep Pace with that Prodigious Man;
Tyrants to lash, and Monsters to engage,
And Stem the Current of an Impious Age:
As in His kindling course the God of Day,
Thro' ev'ry Radient Savage of the Skye:
Thro' such like harms the dauntless Hero Flew,
With Ease He Fought, and careless cou'd Subdue;
Nor ceast to Vanquish in His latest Breath,
For he can Conquer all, who Conquers Death:

And now, His Atlas Fame shall ever stand,
And spread where distant Worlds obey my great Command;
Waft it ye Winds to all the Earth below:
Pearcht on your Wings convey it all around,
Let Eccho's give again the grateful sound;
Sing it some God in Exalted Strain,
Till bounding from the Earth it Touches Heav'n again:

But Thou, Oh!  Princess, to whose Hand is giv'n,
My darling Flock, the Favourites of Heav'n;
My Albion People, who with Virtue sway'd,
Have rais'd my Alters, and my Laws obey'd:
Who foremost in the Stretch of Glory dare,
Inur'd to Toils, and Natives of the War;
Who in the Instant hands the Fauchion Wield,
And Foil the Noblest Coursers of the Field:

No happy Nation under Heav'n before,
Have yet deserv'd, or know my Bounty more;
Eternal Honour by their Prowess won,
And long Majestick Glory handed down,
Makes Gay their Scepter, and bedecks their Crown;
I form'd them Pious, Warlike, Haughty, Brave,
To scorn the abject Title of a Slave;
The Presidents of Beauty, Wit, and Sence,
All Monarchs of themselves, yet faithful to their Prince:
Vertues exalted, and design'd to be,
Worthy of things Divine, and worthy Thee;
Think on the Way my Mighty WILLIAM led,
And the nice Path with strict Observance tread,
Nor scorn to Imitate my Hero Dead;
Think on the Great Eliza how she shone,
Gay in her Virgin Glories like the Moon,
Tho' not with borrow'd Light, but Luster of her own:
Spain knew the Terrour of Her loud Alarms,
And felt the Vigour of a Woman's Arms;
And blusht to own that Albion's Heroines can;
Out-dare the Noblest of its Creatures, Man.

France has too long in Vile subjection Groan'd,
And its too easy Loss of liberty bemoan'd;
A Royal Infidell the Scepter sways,
Who scorns my Threatnings, nor my Will Obeys:
Oh!  Princess, pull that haughty Savage down,
Snatch from his Guilty Brows the Tott'ring Crown;
Ruin and Dessolation round him spread,
Give to my Justice his devoted Head:
Encag'd like Bajazet let him be shewn,
There let the Royal Monster Houl alone;
With Proud disdain, and spight Infernal swell,
And in his loss of Empire find his &mdash; Hell.

Then from all Toils and future Labours cease,
Injoy the Blessings of a Golden Ease;
Eternal Glories shall your goeings wait,
Rough War shall sound no more, but couch beneath your Feet:
Plenty, and Peace shall in Conjunction stand,
And with their willing Beauties court you Hand;
Eternal Records, shall with Anna shine,
Anna, the Great, Immortal, and Divine.

But see, around my Hero's Ghost do's Rove,
And seeks Admittance to the Fields above;
Swiftly Conduct Him to my Peaceful breast,
To Taste Eternity of his endless Rest:
My Mercy's Arms His Spirit shall Enfold,
And Recompence His Toils with Crowns of Gold;
Whence Peace to His Earthly Friends he may bestow,
And show'r down Blessings on the World below:
He say'd &mdash; all Nature nodded and withdrew,
Whilst hov'ring Angels round Britannia flew;
Loud, Heav'nly Musick fill'd th' Etherial space,
And blooming Beauty sat on ev'ry Face:
Fann'd by the Winds the Liquid Odours flye,
And sigh their balmy Breath along the Skye;
Smiling I lay, Immortal Pleasure spread,
O're all my Limbs, and Play'd around my Head:
My Native Joy resum'd its sway again,
And a new Life beat high in ev'ry Vain.

When Lo!  from far the Mighty Shade I saw,
Which at first sight, confest the Great NASSAW;
Jove's shining guards His rising Chariot bear,
And Wing the Mounting Glory thro' the Air:
To the Calm harbour of Maria's Love,
Maria, Fairest of the Saints above;
Lost in excess of Bliss the Hero lyes,
And Drinks th' Eternal nectar of Her Eyes;
In whose fair Beams officious Cupids play,
Clap their Extended Wings, and Hail the Day.
