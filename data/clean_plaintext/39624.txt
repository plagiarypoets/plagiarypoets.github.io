Each shepherd still praises his maid
When fancy and spirit combine;
Why should I then, dear girl, be afraid
To celebrate charms such as thine?
Though rough and unpolish'd my verse,
I mean not my strains to refine;
Yet I cannot refrain to rehearse
The charms of my Kate so divine.

When so lately I bade you adieu,
My heart torn with sorrow and grief,
I thought, without ceasing, on you,
And tears then afforded relief:
I consider'd, how short is our bliss!
I reflected, that misery's sure!
I said to my heart, Think on this,
And let patience afford you a cure!

Can patience (said love) assuage care,
And teach me the charms to forget;
The charms of my ever-dear fair,
And say, Cease to repine and to fret?
Oh!  no &mdash; let it never be said
That patience exists with true love:
I shall soon see again the dear maid&mdash;
This only can sorrow remove.

My happiness then will return,
When I shall revisit my fair;
I shall cease to lament and to mourn,
And then bid adieu to my care:
Fly swift ev'ry hour, and each day,
Oh hear! &mdash; and oh grant my request!
And when with my fair I shall say,
'Tis now that I'm happy and blest!
