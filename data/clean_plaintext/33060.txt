Which Man, and Masters habites we might paint
Though we but Chalke, and Coles, and Ashes had:
For, Chronus clad is like a mortall Saint
In skinnes of Beasts, to shew how life doth fade;
(Which of their age did seem to make complaint)
Girt with an Halter, or with Girth as bad:
Upon whose Head, in stead of Hate, there stoode
An Houre-glasse, as an Embleme of his moode.

His Haire was white as was the driven Snow,
And from his Head it seem'd to hang, by drifts
Turn'd up againe; ev'n as the same doth show
His Beard, beneath his girdle-stead did grow,
Which, platted, in his bosome oft he shifts:
And in his left, an Horologe he held.
