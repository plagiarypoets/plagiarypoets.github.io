Then you, sweete-singing Sirens of these times,
Deere darlings of the Delian Deitie,
That with your Angels-soule-inchauntinge rimes
Transport Pernassus into Britanie,
With learnings garland crowninge Poesie;
Sdaine not that our harsh plaints shoulde beate your eares:
Arts want may stop our tongues, but not our teares.

SPENSER, whose hart inharbours Homers soule,
If Samian Axioms be autenticall:
DANIEL, who well mayst Maro's text controule
With proud Plus ultra true note marginall:
And golden-mouthed DRAYTON musicall,
Into whose soule sweete SIDNEY did infuse
The essence of his Phoenix-feather'd Muse:

Types of true honour, Phoebus Tripodes,
Hell-charminge Orphei, Syrens of the sence,
Wits substance, Joves braine-borne Pallades,
Soules Manna, heavens Ambrosian influence,
True centers of renownes circumference,
The gracefull Graces faire triplicitie,
Of moderne Poets rarest trinarie.

Imbath your Angel-feathers loftie quill
In fluent amber-dropping Castalie,
That liquid gold may from your pen distill,
Encarving characters of memorie,
In brasen-leav'd bookes of eternitie:
Be DRAKES worth royalized by your wits,
That DRAKES high name may coronize your writs.

Let famous RED CROSSE yield to famous DRAKE,
And good Sir GUION give to him his launce;
Let all the MORTIMERS surrender make
To one that higher did his fame advance;
Cease LANCASTERS, and YORKES jars to enhaunce;
Sing all, and all to few to sing DRAKES fame;
Your Poems neede no laurell save his name.

Had he been borne in Agamemnons age,
When stout Achilles launce scourg'd Troies proud towres:
When men gainst men, and Gods gainst Gods did rage,
Aeneas, Achilles, nor Ulysses powres,
Had been so famous in this age of ours:
All poets would have written in his praise
Their Aeneids, Iliads, and Odysses.

But now (O shame!) the vertuous are forgotten,
Th' Heroes are contemn'd, and Neroes told:
The auncient orders all are dead and rotten;
Gone is the eternitie is bought and sold:
Free Poesie is made a merchandize,
Onlie to flatter is to Poetize.

Wel-worth Augustus laurel crowned times,
Pure Halcion houres, Saturnus golden dayes,
When worthies patronized Poets times,
And Poets rimes did onlie worthies praise,
Sdaining base Plutus groomes with fame to raise:
When now, save mercenaryes, few do write,
And be a Poet is be a Parasite.
