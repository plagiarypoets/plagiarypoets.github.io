See hoary winter comes, with dreadful storms,
Of rattling hail, and soft descending snow,
To rule the circling year,
And nature's face deform.

And, hark!  rude Boreas howls the trees among,
His keen, rough blasts lay bare the leafy grove,
And not a songster tunes
His soft and trilling lay.

But underneath some hedge, or straw built house
The warblers sit disconsolate and sad,
Where oft the school-boy tries
To catch the plumy throng.

When Eve, chaste nymph, shall close the eye of day,
And twinkling myriads, o'er the blue expanse,
Their gentle influence lend
To chase the hov'ring gloom;

Then frost, all potent, with his icy chains,
Binds the soft glebe, and stops the bubbling rill,
And ev'n the loud cascade
Forgets his thund'ring roar.

The rapid streams, in which the finny race
Swam sportive, are to slipp'ry ice congeal'd,
And o'er their surface glides
With joy each blooming swain.
