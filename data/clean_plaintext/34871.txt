Swell the clarion, sweep the string,
Blow into rage the Muse's fires!
All thy answers, Eccho, bring,
Let wood and dale, let rock and valley ring,
'Tis Madness self inspires.

Hail, awful Madness, hail!
Thy realm extends, thy powers prevail,
Far as the Voyager spreads his ventrous sail.
Nor best nor wisest are exempt from thee;
Folly &mdash; Folly's only free.

Hark! &mdash; To the astonished ear
The gale conveys a strange tumultuous sound.
They now approach, they now appear,&mdash;
Phrenzy leads her Chorus near,
And Daemons dance around,&mdash;

Pride &mdash; Ambition idly vain,
Revenge, and Malice swell her train,&mdash;
Devotion warped &mdash; Affection crost&mdash;
Hope in Disappointment lost&mdash;
And injured Merit with a downcast eye,
(Hurt by neglect) slow stalking by.

Loud the shouts of Madness rise,
Various voices, various cries,&mdash;
Mirth unmeaning &mdash; causeless moans,
Bursts of laughter, &mdash; heart-felt groans&mdash;
All seem to pierce the skies.&mdash;

Rough as the wintry wave, that roars
On Thule's desart shores,
Wild raving to the unfeeling air,
The fetter'd Maniac foams along,
(Rage the burthen of his jarring song)
In rage he grinds his teeth, and rends his streaming hair.

No pleasing memory left &mdash; forgotten quite
All former scenes of dear delight,
Connubial love &mdash; parental joy&mdash;
No sympathies like these his soul employ,
&mdash;But all is dark within, all furious black Despair.

Not so the love-lorn maid,
By too much tenderness betrayed;
Her gentle breast no angry passion fires,
But slighted vows possess, and fainting, soft desires.

She yet retains her wonted flame,
All &mdash; but in reason, still the same.&mdash;
Streaming eyes,
Incessant sighs,
Dim haggard looks, and clouded o'er with care,
Point out to Pity's tears, the poor distracted fair.
Dead to the world &mdash; her fondest wishes crost,
She mourns herself thus early lost.&mdash;

Now, sadly gay, of sorrows past she sings,
Now, pensive, ruminates unutterable things.
She starts &mdash; she flies &mdash; who dares so rude
On her sequestered steps intrude?&mdash;

'Tis he &mdash; the Momus of the flighty train&mdash;
Merry mischief fills his brain.
Blanket-robed, and antick crown'd,
The mimick monarch skips around;
Big with conceit of dignity he smiles,
And plots his frolicks quaint, and unsuspected wiles.&mdash;

Laughter was there &mdash; but mark that groan,
Drawn from the inmost soul!
"Give the knife, Demons, or the poisoned bowl,
To finish miseries equal to your own."&mdash;

Who's this wretch, with horror wild?&mdash;
&mdash;'Tis Devotion's ruin'd child.&mdash;
Sunk in the emphasis of grief,
Nor can he feel, nor dares he ask relief.&mdash;

Thou, fair Religion, wast design'd,
Duteous daughter of the skies,
To warm and chear the human mind,
To make men happy, good, and wise.
To point, where sits in love arrayed,
Attentive to each suppliant call,
The God of universal aid,
The God, the Father of us all.

First shewn by thee, thus glow'd the gracious scene,
'Till Superstition, fiend of woe,
Bad doubts to rise, and Tears to flow,
And spread deep shades our view and heaven between.

Drawn by her pencil the Creator stands,
(His beams of mercy thrown aside)
With thunder arming his uplifted hands,
And hurling vengeance wide.
Hope, at the frown aghast, yet ling'ring, flies,
And dash'd on Terror's rocks, Faith's best dependence lies.

But ah! &mdash; too thick they croud, &mdash; too close they throng,
Objects of pity and affright!&mdash;
Spare farther the descriptive song&mdash;
Nature shudders at the sight.&mdash;
Protect not, curious ears, the mournful tale,
But o'er the hapless groupe low drop Compassion's veil.
