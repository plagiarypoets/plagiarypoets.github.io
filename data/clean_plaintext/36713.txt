She looked a being of unearthly mould,
A thing superior to the frowns of fate;
But never did my wondering eyes behold
A maid so fair, so wholly desolate;
Yet was she once a child of high estate,
Untouched of sorrow, till its stormy water
Swept o'er her with annihilating weight,
And 'mid surrounding cloud and tempest brought her
A wreck to ruin's shore &mdash; earth's sweetest, loveliest daughter!

Dark was her eye, as heaven, when gathering thunder
Comes slowly travelling up the muffled sky,
And pitying strangers view'd with awe and wonder
Its glance of still expressive misery:
Her cheek was pale, her brow serene and high,
Her look distraught, and in her liveliest tone
Breathed the low, pensive music of a sigh:&mdash;
Oh!  woman's fond and breaking heart alone,
That holiest shrine of love, can breathe such plaintive moan.

Oft when the spirit of departed light
Waned in eve's shadowy chambers, she would lean
Upon the pulseless bosom of the night,
Sorrow's meek image; or at morn be seen
Pacing with leaden steps the fresh cool green
Of mead and dell; or when, at midnight hour,
The eyes of heaven looked forth with glance serene&mdash;
Or when the storm swept by on wing of power&mdash;
Mute &mdash; mindless &mdash; would she view star flash and thunder lower.

She was the child of nature:  earth, sea, sky,
Mountain and cataract, thymy hill and dale,
Possessed (when thought returned) in her young eye
A nameless magic; for in Elle's low vale
Her heart first listen'd to a lover's tale:
'Twas here &mdash; ere yet in May's capricious eve
Her wanderer had unfurl'd his fatal sail&mdash;
Love taught her fond, unpractised heart to grieve,
And with boon nature's charms his wildest spells to weave.

But she is gone:  unknown from life she passed,
Like a poor exile from his native home;
No mother mourned her loss, when downward cast
The chill dust rattled on her virgin tomb:
Alone she lived &mdash; alone within the gloom
Of death she slumbers &mdash; never more to prove
How Fate's sure canker dims the rising bloom
Of young Affection, never more to rove
A wanderer through the bleak and stormy world of love.

But oft at eve, when day is in the west,
And lingering winds o'er mead and moorland die,
Strange sounds come stealing from her place of rest,
And sink into the heart, like woman's sigh:
The twittering thrush, the cuckoo wild and shy,
The matin lark, the music-laden rill,
Pour on the night their funeral minstrelsy
O'er her who sleeps, while all around is still&mdash;
Her last, long, dreamless sleep, beside Llansaddon hill.
