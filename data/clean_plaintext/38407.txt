A light cloud coronals Benledi's brow;&mdash;
Still up the steep ascent be mine to strain,
Nor deem the toil as idle.  Oh!  how slow
The sluggish hour rolls on; &mdash; but see!  again
Peering all-beauteous 'bove the vapoury train,
Thy giant form is seen the hills among.
Child of the mountain mist!  And now I gain
Thy towery height, and muse upon the throng
Of countless charms around, and wake the soul to song.
