At length was poor CORYDON seen
Bewailing beneath an elm tree,
Which grew upon Camberwell-green,
So chuckfull of sorrow was he.

No powder was there in his wig,
No spirit was there in his eye;
And his pipe that could once play a jig,
With his crook were hung carelessly by.

LYCIDAS.
Why make this nonsensical rout
For a matter that's not worth a pin?
Why should you be weeping without,
When the breakfast is waiting within.

The tea is put into the pot,
There's a fine butter'd toast at the fire,
The muffins are charming and hot,
What more can my shepherd require?

CORYDON.
Once muffins were all my delight,
Once with ease I demolished a score;
Once I thought butter'd roles a good sight;
Butter'd toasts I could almost adore!

But now quite dejected with woe,
My gizzard is grumbling all day;
And the plaits in my waistcoat will shew
How much I am fallen away.

LYCIDAS.
Why does CORYDON pine thus in thought?
Burn my wig, if I'd fret thus and stew,
Till my guts were to fiddle-strings brought,
And I think you're a fool if you do.

But I've news that will give you content,
So I prithee, lad, whimper no more;
Mr. A&mdash;n P&mdash;m has sent,
And they dine at Guildhall as before.

CORYDON.
Then Shepherd adieu to all care,
This will comfort my cockles indeed;
O &mdash; I'll meet Mr. Alderman there,
The appointment's already agreed.

There'll be Deputy W&mdash;n's so wise;
There'll be H&mdash;s&mdash;d half stewed in his grease;
They'll be great store of charming minc'd pies,
And plenty of Michaelmas geese.

Tongue and udders too then will come in,
Together with turkies and chine;
Ah!  what would I give to begin
The very next moment to dine!

LYCIDAS.
And there will be Ladies so fair!

CORYDON.
And there will be Judges so grand!

LYCIDAS.
And there we shall see my Lord Mayor!

CORYDON.
And there'll be the musical band!

LYCIDAS.
And I hope, when the dishes appear,
The things will be all in their prime,

CORYDON.
And I wish that my taylor was here
To let out my waistcoat in time!
