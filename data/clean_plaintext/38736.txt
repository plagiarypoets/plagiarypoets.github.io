Here rests secure, within this narrow Cell,
A Youth to Pain and Disappointment known;
Pride mock'd his Birth, and Envy smil'd to tell
The Hour when Sorrow mark'd him for her own.

Fix'd on one Object was his Soul sincere;
But Heav'n the Recompence of Love deny'd:
Long hov'ring o'er th' Extremes of Hope and Fear,
Oppress'd by Fate he sunk, despair'd and dy'd!

No farther seek his Mis'ries to disclose,
Nor let pale Envy trample on his Tomb:
Here let his hapless Head enjoy Repose,
And leave to Mercy and to God his Doom.
