Here worth exalted undistinguish'd lies,
No stone, alas!  to claim one grateful tear;
Yet Fame shall sound his plaudit in the skies,
Whilst list'ning angels hush their hymns to hear.

True worth alone his monument shall prove,
No marble need be rear'd his praise to tell;
Yet 'twere but just that those who felt his love,
Should pay some tribute to his God-like zeal.

Should proud Ambition sleep beneath the tomb
Of pomp and state, to catch the public eye,
While a rude grave alone shall prove his doom
Who fell a victim to Humanity?

Forbid it!  ev'ry virtue of the soul,
Forbid it!  Justice, from thy sacred throne;
Let some inscription, form'd to speak the whole,
Proclaim his merit on some humble stone.

And, that Necessity may prove no plea,
Accept these lines, though homely, yet sincere;
For, ah!  did each spectator feel like me,
Not one would quit his grave without a tear.

EPITAPH.
Beneath this stone "The Man of Feeling" lies,
Humanity had marked him for her own:
His virtue rais'd him to his native skies
Ere half his merit to the world was known.

In health and full-blown prime he nobly dy'd,
To save a drowning youth he dar'd the wave;
But, ere his throbbing bosom well had sigh'd,
Th' obdurate Avon prov'd their mutual grave.

O'er his remains, ah!  drop one grateful tear,
For far from kindred and from friends he lies;
No parent strew'd his solitary bier,
No kind relation clos'd his clay-cold eyes.
