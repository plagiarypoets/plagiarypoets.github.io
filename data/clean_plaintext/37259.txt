Must I still wear Time's heavy hours away!
Whose tedious moments pass reluctant by,
Each passing as it goes, with dull delay,
As tho' 'twould claim the requiem of a sigh,
And tear my heart's last hope from me: &mdash; Must I,
Apart from all my soul holds dear, still seek
To cheat myself of care, scarce knowing why;&mdash;
And feel my childish heart is all too weak,&mdash;
And cherish still a gloom which language cannot speak?

Must I &mdash; but wherefore do I still complain!
Who will regard my querimonious song?&mdash;
Ah!  there it is! &mdash; I sigh and sing in vain,
And chide my foolish heart, and say "'tis wrong
To murmur to indifferent ears so long."
But scarce this mild censure I repeat,
Ere my tumultuous feelings wildly throng
Across my prudent purpose, and defeat
My cold intentions with enthusiastic heat.

And now &mdash; (forgive me idol of my heart!
That I so often trespass on thine ear,&mdash;
My soul's dark spirit will not hence depart,
Till it has told its tale, tho' sad, sincere,&mdash;
And breath'd a sigh and shed, perhaps, a tear.
Oh!  then sweet angel of my peace, to thee,
Who art, of all things else, most priz'd &mdash; most dear,
I urge my prayer, &mdash; that thou wilt suffer me,
In this sad, lonely hour to speak my misery.

&mdash;This lonely hour &mdash; for tho' in "my mind's eye"
I see thee still, as I am wont to see,&mdash;
Yet I am sad, and ask my Reason, "why
In Fortune's dispensations, it should be,
That one who is so priz'd &mdash; so dear to me&mdash;
To whom my heart in tenderness could cling
And hang forever in sweet ecstasy,
Should be away &mdash; and separation bring
To my unhappy soul, an agonizing sting?"

Thus! &mdash; thus, thou angel of my peace and hope,
Did not the truth outstrip all words, I'd tell
What my heart feels &mdash; But language cannot cope
With the warm spirit of my soul; &mdash; nor well
Express the influence of my bosom's swell
Of rapture, when thy soul-sustaining eye,
In hasty and retiring glances, fell
Upon my vision; and in a hush'd sigh,
My inmost feelings breathe their eloquent reply.

But now no more! &mdash; I've trespass'd all too long!
My fugitive &mdash; my vagrant strain is o'er&mdash;
Forgotten soon, the Minstrel and his song
Shall pass away and trouble thee no more;
And thou shalt smile regardless as before,
When not one trace remains of him to tell,
Whom thou canst not revere, nor wilt deplore!
But ah!  I pause! &mdash; I feel my heart rebel!
Oh!  must I go from thee! &mdash; Oh! &mdash; must I say farewell!

Still!  still my heart, like one who gasps for life,
Clings to its last faint hope with trembling fear;
And still in agony, amidst its strife,
Feels all its peace, in darkness disappear!
Oh!  I could die for thee, thou art so dear!&mdash;
Or I could live, and be thy slave forever;
And e'en in wretchedness, if thou wert near,
Feel that life had no happier lot, &mdash; and never
Desire in weal or woe &mdash; in life or death, to sever!

But ah!  it is not &mdash; never it can be!&mdash;
Thou wilt not listen to my soul's deep tale!&mdash;
Peace and farewell, thou dear one! &mdash; peace to thee!
My song is o'er &mdash; my words cannot avail&mdash;
The wilderness shall hear my midnight wail,
And my poor heart, to thee too sternly true,
Till life's last impulse tremblingly shall fail,
Shall hold thy dear, dear image still in view!&mdash;
But now no more! &mdash; Forgive my foolish strain! &mdash; Adieu!
