I'll pluck, sweet Love!  another flow'r for thee,
(If poesy have flow'rs my hand may reach:)
While Spring remains, in ev'ry bloom I see,
There's that which to my sadden'd heart doth teach,
More than the loftiest orator could preach!
Leaf follows leaf, and flower succeeds to flow'r,
And nature sheds on all, her smile and tear:
On the fresh rose alike, and her whose hour
Is past; whose relics lie on their cold earthy bier.

Yes!  the pale sever'd leaf partakes the dews
That nurse the expanding bud, the ripen'd bloom;
Nor mine the niggard breast that can refuse
Thy share of love, tho' mould'ring in the tomb:&mdash;
Thee, summer suns shall never more illume,
But tears shall fall, and sighs for thee shall heave,
And warm in mem'ry's bed I'll cherish thee,
Till this fond bosom lose the pow'r to grieve,
And earth's brief joys and cares, alike forgotten be!

Yet mourn I not, as those of hope bereft,&mdash;
Blest hope!  that consecrates the Christian's dust:
Sad, but not comfortless, my soul is left;&mdash;
Father of Love!  I know in whom I trust;&mdash;
My pious child rejoices with the just!
He who on little children deigned to lay
His blessed hands, and called them heirs of heav'n,
Forbids a doubt to cloud my lonely way&mdash;
Her infant pray'rs were heard!  O be my tears forgiv'n.
