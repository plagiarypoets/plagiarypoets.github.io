Thy fane, AUBERT, with reverence I view,
And hail its noble use and sacred store;
Such as MINERVA'S temples never knew,
Nor all the ancient world with all its lore.
Here heavenly truth, and solid science charm,
Here Arts divine new faculties supply;
Mechanic powers give more than giant's arm;
And optics furnish more than eagle's eye:
Eyes which explore Creation's wondrous laws,
And teach us to adore the great designing cause.

On these strong wings we mount ethereal space,
The wide machine of Heaven minutely scan;
GOD'S wisdom, power, and handy-work we trace,
The noblest privilege of little man.
New systems croud upon us as we climb,
Each star supports a train of circling spheres
Which run their stated rounds in punctual time,
Nor miss a moment in ten thousand years,
Perpetual motion in Heaven's high works maintain,
Which human art must imitate in vain.

Then hail thy taste, sublime and skilful hand,
Which raised a fane those wonders to survey;
No private edifice so truly grand,
Few kings such heavenly treasure can display.
Nor should the muse disdain that rural grace
Which marks and decorates surrounding scenes.
May lasting beauties deck the learned place,
And laurels grow, and sacred ever greens;
And may unfading honours grace thy name,
And true ambition emulate thy fame!
