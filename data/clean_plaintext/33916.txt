Paplet lov'd (ah lov'd too well!)
A gentle boy, his Name was Coll;
Colly the DARLING of the Plains,
And softest he of all the Swains.
As she for Colley, Cuddleit sigh'd for her;
The little Lad that has white ringlet HAIR.

He'd throw him down, and cry, as hurt,
Oh, what's the matter with my HEART!
Long set, and muse on Paplet's face;
Then clasp his Arms in eagerness.
Ah Paplet!  Thou small weenest how thou art,
Cause of such pain to such a gentle HEART!

Acquaint he was with Floreynet,
Who liv'd as Brother with Paplet.
Oft Florey did he go to see;
Oft staid the Eve; oft with him lay.
Yet none, not Paplet, dare he tell his Smart;
But stand close by, and soft say, O my Heart!

'Tween Florey's bed and that of th' Lass
Only a little WALL there was.
Cuddleit oft wak'd; his Cheek he'd clap
Close to the WALL; and wish mayhap.
And oft as stir'd the gentle-breathing Lass,
So oft he'd cling to th' Wall, so often kiss't.

One Night (a frosty Night it was)
Soft-musing lay he on the Lass;
Whenas he heard her get out bed;
Sure I shall find the HEATH!  She said.
Chary from out the warm Cloaths too crep he;
Dress'd him; and got a-field before the MEY.

She lay with, like a Rosie sweet,
Her little Brother Dillinet.
Him took she with her to the HEATH;
O Pap, quoth he, 'Tis cold as Death!
But Colly there that Morn his HEIFERS drove;
And Paplet ne're had seen the Lad her Love.

To dress her quick the lilly MEY,
Flirted as busy as a Bee.
Sweetly her Hair was braided, she
Clad in the softness of a SAY.
Fair was her face, her Vest white &mdash; sooth she show'd
The Lilly on a Heap of Roses strow'd!

All time of Colly chat's the MEY,
All time had thought for many a day.
Yet oft the head she hung; may seem
Ashamed still to talk of him.
Some RINGLET-LOCKS atween her breasts were flung
Mayhap he'll like it!  said the tender Tongue.

Soft were those breasts, as soft and sweet,
As is at EVE the Floret's WET.
And all her care was how to get
Out, Ne be heard, with Dillinet.
He merry little Wag, would hop and play;
All-sweet as LAMKIN on the flowerie LEA.

And when she snib'd (she could not hit)
'Twould smile so pretty!  Smile so sweet!
Then take her hand and promise oft
(Looking at Lip) he'd kiss it soft:
Then make his tender Mouth her fair Hand hit,
I-faith I can but smile to think how sweet!

Her beauty fresh 'gan bloom, and ope
It's bashful bosom to th' dew-drop;
But sure, had you her Shape but seen!
Yfay 'twas fair as flowerie-Green!
Simp'ring she smil'd; 'lack!  all unlike the Meny;
Sweet were her lips, and Oh her tongue dropt Honey!

Say me, ye gentle STRIPLINGS say!
If e're ye saw so soft a MEY:
Ye gentle STRIPLINGS, by my Fay!
As soft she was as SUMMER-DAY.
Yet oft she'd muse, as head on hand did lay,
And inly sigh full sore; sweet hapless MEY!

Now twice to pass unheard she try's;
Twice Dilly makes a lumbring Noise;
So that the boy she took up quick,
And bad him hang about her Neck.
The lilly-finger'd Lass fair hold's her VEST
With one hand, t' other feel's the Way she pas't.

Kist her all Way the little ELF;
(Why sooth she could'nt help her self!)
Her snowie Neck and dainty Paps;
Then to her Cheek his Cheek he clap's.
Fligg'ring and laughing that he had her now.
Shrewd HEART; how well he found the Way out tho'!

The Path a-to Lynheath, where fed
Colly ran thro' a gloomy Wood.
At Edge hereof poor Cuddleit stand's,
To meet his Paplet, as by Chance.
His Heart went pit-a-pat when spy'd the Lass,
For 'sham'd to love the little Shepherd was.

SCENE II.
A LARGE WOOD.
CUDDLEIT, PAPLET, DILLIN.

CUDDLEIT.
Sure gentle Paplet 'tis I see!
My gentle Paplet, where away?

PAPLET.
I hope t'ant Cuddleit that I see!
I prethee Shepherd stand away!

CUDDLEIT.
Send me sweet MEY; go thou, where wo't, and play
How should thy tender Limbs with Frost away?

This Place ill suits a Lass so fair;

PAPLET.
How should it, Swain, when you are here?

CUDDLEIT.
Oh, see the DIRT doth touch thy Foot!

PAPLET.
I'ad rather That than Thou should'st do't!

CUDDLEIT.
Nay I am going; thro' this Wood; I staid
But only 'cause I thought I heard some Tread.

Oh, Paplet!  I've a thing to say!
You know the HAYCOCK; there to Day,
Six Swainets and as meny Meys,
A Match have made at KISS and BRACE!
You'll go?  You'll hap be judge (O lucky Lass!)
Whose Grasp is tend'rest, whose the sweetest Kiss.

PAPLET.
Lucky?  He!  He!  When Colly's there?
And Cubbin too?  O teazing Pair!

CUDDLEIT.
Then 'blieve me Lass, not one will be!
For Colly goes to hunt to day.
And Cubbin to GREAT-TOWN; 'tis talk'd, to tell
The Gay-Maids there what Lallet late befell!

PAPLET.
To day? &mdash; Well, what harm's that, I trow?
I wish you'd get ye gone there now!
Say he does tell, Leud Boy!  He shall,
Tell all; Why he can't help it well;
They get him there, poor Swain, and make him prattle,
And he has nothing else, you know, to tattle.

CUDDLEIT.
May he do it?  Why then he may.
But Paplet, you a while a-way,
When he would go, would hang on's Waste,
And hit his Cheek, Ne let him rest,
Till you had forc't him turn, and cry anon,
Sweet mine own HEART, I ne're will go agen!

PAPLET.
And sweet my PAIN, I think you ne're
Will go at-all!  what do ye here?
Come Dilly, let's along! &mdash; what now?
Good Servant Swain!  I call'd not you!

CUDDLEIT.
But I this dull Wood pass too, gentle MEY.

PAPLET.
Then call it dull no more, 'twill dismal be!

Thus pretty Paplet saith in sooth,
And ope's the GATE, and onward go'th,
But was so grieved for the Swain,
Went little way, and came agen.
Yet knew not why, ev'n then (sweet LIFE) tho' strove,
Could'nt help be rough:  O LOVE!  O cruel LOVE!

Up to the Swain she came, but there
Could only turn, and drop a Tear.
The head she hung, to seem so rough,
But saw full sad, One Love's enough.
Now on they pass, the Shepherd too did pass;
And walking on, such CHAT they had as this.

CUDDLEIT.
Ha!  Ha!  I ne're shall love, I know;
But should it ever happen tho',
A CADE I'd keep, and teach it how
Lick Lasse's Hand, and pat her Shoe.
Oh, ev'n the Air should never breath on Face,
Save when did breath as soft as any Glass.

How I should love, in heat of Day,
To watch her, as Asleep she lay!
The Shepherds STRAWB'RYS she should get;
And beat their LAMBS, if would 'em beat.
A Bear's CUB have I, now it hate's a Maid;
But that too on her Knee should lay it's Head.

But I shall never love I find;
So, Paplet, if you have a Mind,
The Cub is your's, and 'tis I-Fay,
A Cub as fair as Dawning-day!

PAPLET.
Keep, Swain, thy Cubs!  They're rough and fit for thee,
But what am I to Cubs, or Cubs to Me?

CUDDLEIT.
Nay, where it is, the sooth to say,
'Tis well enough; 't has room to play.
But soft ye!  Here's an end of th' TRACK!
We've lost the way; ah less the luck!

PAPLET.
Quick scale that Tree, mayhap the Side you'll ken.
O hapless I, to follow such a Swain!

But take-ye-heed!  the Wind is high!
That Bough will break, good gentle Boy!
See, how you sweave!  what see you there?

CUDDLEIT.
No Edge: &mdash; I see a falling STAR.
Oh me!  In th' Plat that's hem'd with Trees thro'-out,
Meseem's I see some FAIRYS dance about!

And there!  (O would you saw the Sight!)
A WILL-A-WHISP with Lanthorn light!

PAPLET.
What they to us:  O good come down!
O how you swing!  I well 'y swoon.
Don't drop so fast.  What must We must We do?
So now you're safe:  Come, this way let us go.

CUDDLEIT.
O I hard Heart!  more hard than Stone!
To lead out way so tender One.
Here Paplet, sweetest Paplet take
My Coat, and throw ebout thy back!
The Frost will bite thy dainty Lip, I fear!
And oh, the Dew will stain thy Bosom bare!

But ha!  where now?  What HOLE is this?

PAPLET.
We go but more and more amiss!

CUDDLEIT.
Alas sweet MEY, what can I do?
And oh that Thorn has claw'd thee too!

PAPLET.
Tis nothing that; my Breast is tore, and Arm!

CUDDLEIT.
Hold thee about my WASTE!  'twill hide from harm.

O Paplet!  (why 'tis best of bad)
I see a HAYCOCK; to it speed!
We'll lay Us warm awhile in it,
'Twill soon be Day my gentle SWEET!
I'll cover thee so close, No whit of Wet
Shall to thy Face or Hands or Bosom get!

PAPLET.
No; better is to walk I weet;
Sure we or Way or Man shall meet.

CUDDLEIT.
But gentle you!  a Swain I see.
Stay here; I'll step and ask the Way.

PAPLET.
Be quick. O Paplet!  were not better now,
Thy pure warm Bed?  What's here but Frost and Snow!

Alas, and is, and is this then
To Love?  O harmful gentlest Swain!
Then let me keep this tender Boy,
From loving where no hope may be!
His youngling-heart is now as late was mine;
O me!  (thought I) sure Love is fair and fine!

CUDDLEIT.
Why dost thou lean agenst the Tree;
And wrap thy Face in Vest, my MEY?
Look up, sweet Life!  why yonder Swain
Has shewn me to my Way agen!
Step here, twill wet thee else:  I prethee take
My Hand, or sooth the Breer thy Breast will prick!

PAPLET.
Be quiet!  I can go alone!
Ne lack I Swains to help me on!

CUDDLEIT.
Sweet Paplet, here's the way.  And see
The Moon, meseem's, gin brighter be.
But good my Paplet, walk a-neath my Vest;
I-Fay 'twill chop thy Lip and blue thy Breast!

PAPLET.
You care that's not your Care; what be
My Breasts, I trow, or Lips to thee?
I wa'nt for me you'd roll in Snow;
You do so blith and bonny show!

CUDDLEIT.
Ah for such talk wa'nt made that Tongue, sweet MEY!
Suiten sweet MEY soft Song or Virilay.

But see, my Paplet!  do but see!
We're gotten out of Wood I-fay!

PAPLET.
Ay, now we're well; and were we rid
Of thee as well, 'twere well indeed.

CUDDLEIT.
Why Paplet, thee to please, I'll try my way
To find a-back; &mdash; tho' fearful 'tis Yfay!

He said; and when he once had said,
She kept him to his word indeed.
And sooth to say, how could she 'ere
Meet Collikin, while he was there?
But oh, how loath the young HEART is to go!
Yet 'sham'd he be what said to unsay now.

With folded Arms, and hanging Head,
Athro' the Wood a while he stray'd;
Then lean'd his Head agenst an Oak,
And in the Snow did write with Crook,
Paplet to kiss; (he knew not what to do)
I-faith I 'blieve a thousand times wrote so!

But Collikin the Lass espyed,
All as she on with Dillin hied;
For Colly was the Swain that show'd
The gentle Cuddleit to the Road.
And heard how all unwilling Paplet was
To let him love, and willing not to please.

For all the way she went along,
Unseen he crep the Breers emong.
Oh gentle-hearted Lass!  (quoth he
Soft to himself) O meekly MEY!
Was ever Lass so kind, to keep from hope
A Swain so young, 'cause was no room for hope!

But now the tender-triping Lass
Out Wood upon the HEATH does pass.
And he at Edge a while doth wait,
Till out of sight the MEY might get.
She, pretty HEART, her little Hands did lay
All in her Bosom; and thus soft gan say.

SCENE III.
A BLEA AND OPEN HEATH, WITH BUSHES.
PAPLET.  DILLIN.

PAPLET.
The Dawn begin's to break; there lyes
The East, where now that Night-Crow fly's.

DILLIN.
What is this HOAR-FROST spread so white?
O me!  how blea the Air doth bite!

PAPLET.
Tis keen and eager; small alas off-cast
These BUSHES, with froz'n Isicles, the Blast!

Alas poor Lad, thee pain I too.
Did'st see but how thy Hair doth show!

DILLIN.
O, mind not me!  withouten me,
You pain enough:  Yes, I can see.

PAPLET.
No whit, not I!  But soft me, is he tall?
Are his Legs slender?  Prethee tattle Dill!

DILLIN.
Whom meanest MEY?  You asken that;
But let me ask a thing for Chat.
Say why you rise so early now?
When bleak and frosty BLASTS do blow?
I lye and hear 'em, but dare not put out
My Toe a-bed; I cry 'cause you're about.

PAPLET.
Fie, Sirrah!  you must ne're say so!
Besure do'nt tell thy Father now!

DILLIN.
Tell why you walk by MOON-LIGHT then,
In Orchat, ere the Day gin dawn?

PAPLET.
Shrewd HEAD!  Sirrah, I say you must be beat,
If you do talk so.  Is his Hair tho' strait?

DILLIN.
Tell me, Paplet, what thee ail's?
Sooth I'll not tell any else!
Once my cutten FINGER made
Me wake; and thus a-sleep you said.
O this is He!  (and laugh'd and fliggar'd too)
It is the Boy!  by th' LIGHT, it is the Boy!

PAPLET.
But was'tne YesterEve you said,
By LYN-HEATH Shepherd Colly fed.

DILLIN.
It was, and there his HEIFERS he
Drove yesterday, and drives to day.

PAPLET.
I hope he'll not come by while we are here!
For he must pass this part of th' Plain I fear.

DILLIN.
He will abie them BUSHES go.
But we've no business there you know.

PAPLET.
Soft ye!  a thing I saw, methought,
All white; Is COSSET thither got?

DILLIN.
If 'tis, twill starve; Sweet FON!  let's just go see.
Doe's Colly eat Folks, that ye fear him MEY?

PAPLET.
Ay, sooth!  he's rough and sowr, they say.

DILLIN.
No whit!  he's soft as Month of May!

PAPLET.
But he'as a hugeous stalking step.

DILLIN.
O Me!  when 'tis the gentlest Trip!
The Women and the Daughters of the Grove,
As passes, bless him; and as bless him, love!

But soft ye!  sure the Mist a-thro',
The Morning Mist, I see him go&mdash;

PAPLET.
Say'st?  Where?  But show me!  what on there? 

DILLIN.
No; 'tis the Snow, born up by breer.

PAPLET.
He!  He!  so fair?  To stay were almost well,
Only to show how all untrue you tell!

DILLIN.
I'll lay thee what thou wo't he's so.
But soft!  I-sooth he cometh now!

PAPLET.
O how I glad!  Sweet dearest Boy,
Let hug thee!  happy happy I!
I want his Soflin; him I'll ask where be.
A little while and he'll be here I-Fay!

DILLIN.
Soft, Paplet, he is well'y here,

PAPLET.
O me!  I thought him not so near!
I wish he'ad not come yet!  I thought
To have been ready:  I'll say nought:
I'll only look:  Is this he here?  Alas,
I quiver; What shall do?  Has he seen us?

I would he had not come!  I wish
I'ad lain a-bed!  Let's skulk in BUSH!

DILLIN
Why he'll not harm&mdash;

PAPLET.
Hush Child he'll hear!
Ha!  Ha!  he comes!  run hind that Breer!
No, we'll stand't out. &mdash; run Dill behind; he's here!
I'll not be seen this time.  Look at his Hair.

DILLIN.
Now lye still, Pap; Do'nt whisper so.
I see's slim WASTE; and his Locks blow.
O me!  thou tar'st thy Neck with Bough!
Why do'st not mind?  The Drops fall too!

PAPLET.
Hush, Dillinet!  he's gone.  No; still his hair
I can see fly.  Now, look!  he'll turn just there.

Now look, He turn's, He goe's; look!  look!
&mdash;Should he not one View of me took?
How can he like, if doth not see.
'Twere better.  O I bashful!  He
Is gone.  O Witless!  Foolish!  run boy, run, hast!
To Collikin; what stand'st?  O Heav'n!  scowr fast.

DILLIN.
What must I say when there I get?
Nothing, but Collikin well met!

PAPLET.
Oh, any thing!  how small I care;
Say I am scratch'd; am dying here!
Yet stay; poor gentle little boy!  how should
You go and speak, when I so illy could?

Thus was the gentle-hearted Lass,
By sight of him more ill at ease.
And now what doe's she, when alone,
But go and set on a cold Stone.
And first gan muse, with head agenst a Tree,
And inly sigh full sore:  Alass sweet MEY!

Then leaning back her pretty Head,
With folded Arms, she softly said.
Such was his Look; so hung his Hair;
And thus the Youth himself did bear.
And so thro' all his Features she would pass;
How sleek his Limbs, how fine and fair his Face.

Then wipe's the lilly-handed Lass,
Her dewie Breast, and tearie Face,
And rises soft; we'll go, quoth she,
And look where Collikin may be.
Now he with Soflin his TRUE-LOVE had met;
Soflin as sweet, as breath of Morn is sweet.

They smil'd to hear the Winds by-rush,
Skulk'd in the Covert of a BUSH.
Within the Bush was truss'd fresh Hay;
And soft they sate, as fair as Day.
Soflin her Apron o're her Colly spread,
And Colly 'neath his Arm his Soflin laid.

Strait, to 'em steal's unseen the MEY;
Ynethered on hand and knee.
If Leaves a little rustle made,
She squatted as a Hare afraid.
Ne breathed:  Sooth her heart went pit-a-pat;
She quak'd at Air; her Shadow skewed at.

Whenas she came a-hind the Breer,
Close crep to Colly as she dare.
O happy HAY!  (soft said the Lass)
Thrice happy Hay, to bear his Face!
Soflin he kist; O how her Heart did yearn!
The Bush she shak't; yet wisht he might not turn.

Paplet, quoth Soflin, was last-day
At WAKE.  That Paplet, answer'd he,
And pauz'd to cough.  She prick'd her Ears;
Her Heart beat; pale she look'd with fears.
That Paplet soothly is a tender MEY!
Walk thro' the World you sha'nt a softer see!

But ah!  how this the Youngling warms!
Dilly she caught in eager Arms.
Brisk fliggar'd, Kist, and kist agen;
And look't, the while, at Collikin.
And as the tender Air his breath did blow;
She catch'd the Air; quoth she, his Breath I've too!

But now the kindly Cudleit could,
No longer wait in th' gloomy WOOD.
He wondred why the MEY came not;
And sure, said he, She'as some Mishap.
So, when he yearn'd, and could no longer stay,
He came and saw the Lass where loose she lay.

She saw not him, till close he got,
And in his eager Arms her caught.
And then what could She, could not cry,
Ne struggle, Collikin so nigh.
Much while she bore the soothing of the Swain;
Then sprang, and won her Limbs yloose agen.

But Colley heard, and thro' the HAY
Peeping, yspy'd the struggling TWEY.
He saw it was the kindly MEY,
He lik'd in th' Wood a while-a-way.
And shall not I, he cry'd, go take the part,
Of such a gentle such a tender Heart!

So saying step'd 'em both a-tween.
Then oh how lookt the Youngling-Swain!
He started, blush'd, and inly sigh'd;
While Paplet off with Colly hied.
Who 'ore the Plains and Meadows with her go'th,
And softly sooth's as soft as he can sooth.

The LAD was jolly as the Day;
Merry the LASS as Month of May.
He leap'd and laugh'd a-thwart the Mead;
She simper'd, smil'd, and turn'd the Head.
All Way her VEST he smooth'd, and stroak'd her Hair,
And knew not why, but sigh'd when left the Dear.
