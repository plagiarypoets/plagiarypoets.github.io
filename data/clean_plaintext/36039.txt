Silent and slow along thy sedgy shore,
Fair Isis, as I take my twilight way,
And pensive listening to the dashing oar,
Frame in thy praise some tender farewell lay;
My melting soul looks back upon the day
When first I knew thee &mdash; welcome to that hour!
Hail to that moment! &mdash; though the Gothic sway
Of Pedant Tyranny upon me shower
The last &mdash; worst &mdash; venom'd shafts of its deceitful power.

Oxford!  I leave thee &mdash; not in ire or wrath&mdash;
Though Friendship false put off her borrow'd hue,
And the keen adder hath been in my path&mdash;
Still must my lips send forth a soft adieu;
Memory still twines around thy joy &mdash; and who
Hath quaff'd the cup where dregs may not be found?
Home of my youth! &mdash; when fading from my view
Thy spires recede, and all thy classic ground.
Such parting will inflict an ever-staunchless wound!

There be but few who will not soon forget
Me and my foibles &mdash; faults &mdash; perchance my name&mdash;
And I shall vanish as a dream; but yet
I have avow'd, and still assert the claim
(Let the proud pedant Cynic praise or blame)
That thou hast on me, while the faithful heart
Of One remains &mdash; and while the mutual flame
Of Friendship burns, and will its joys impart,
Then welcome to the worst, and Hate's most angry dart.

And him I had not known, perchance nor seen,
But thou in thy benevolence gav'st to me
That radiant star that boasts the brightest sheen
Of all in Friendship's youthful galaxy&mdash;
Ne'er may that heart forget to love, but be
As the bright glow-worm to the night of life,
That shines when all is dark uncertainty&mdash;
Who, when his path with peril, toil, be rife,
Would ask a better guide in this wide world of strife?

And thou too &mdash; save one &mdash; the dearest friend,
How vainly memory honours up the breast;
Say &mdash; will our hearts continue still to blend,
Till wearied life sigh for its final rest?
Wilt thou remember those brief visions drest
In hope's bright colours &mdash; while we yet were young,
And yet 'twas our life's bitter bowl to taste,
When on each word &mdash; look &mdash; friendship's accents hung,
And mutual fondness dwelt on each endearing tongue?

To thee &mdash; to all &mdash; who here my path have bless'd,
I bid a long &mdash; perchance a last farewell&mdash;
But who the ivy from the trunk can wrest?
Whene'er of youthful hearts and joy I tell,
Remembrance o'er her web invisible,
Will twine around my soul &mdash; that here she wove&mdash;
And hold it bound in that resistless spell,
That seems to shed, where'er our footsteps rove,
A halo o'er the forms of those we us'd to love.
