Here then we leave this lower world and all
That it can offer, threaten; all that we
In other hours would pain or pleasure call,
To raise us from the sluggish body free,
And range through worlds which in immensity
Lie scattered through the regions of the skies,
The caverns of the earth, depths of the sea,
All that is evident to our wishing eyes,
And all that in the dark obscure of nature lies.

Or shutting out the world of sense and care,
Thought on itself turns its own scrutiny:
Tracing the springs which of our being, are
The moving principles, with curious eye;
Striving to penetrate the mystery,
The marvellous laws, which operate through all
Its divers works, we know not how or why;
Struggling to pierce the cloud, that, like a wall,
Compels us from the search our daring thoughts to call.

Or, loftier still, the unthralled mind,
With almost disembodied speed, can roam
In its excursive flight, still unconfined,
E'en through the wide precincts of yon wide dome,
Which, pure as when in nature's first born bloom
It spread at God's command its starry page,&mdash;
Offers to daring thought a distant home,
Where, in its bold aspiring pilgrimage,
It seeks for its own source, design, and heritage.

See, on yon broad expanse of deepened blue,
Planets and worlds are vying in their race,
Of beauty and of harmony; in hue
Ten times more beauteous than this orb, whose face
Reflects but borrow'd light, and meaner grace
A goodly and a glorious multitude,
Whose numbers human wisdom could not trace,
Were we with patriarchal lives endued,
And ages given to life the reck'ning to conclude.

At this expansive thought how swells the mind,
Lifts and dilates itself as if t' embrace,
In its outspreading grasp, the mighty whole,
And purified from aught earthly and base,
To fill the regions of unbounded space
With its own presence, as if there it could,
And only there, find fit abiding place
For its high aspirations, which subdued,
Finds in the world's pursuits an uncongenial food.

And leaving this dull atmosphere, to see,
With eyes and mind from those dark shadows freed,
Which dimming sight left not the spirit free,
Upon the pinions of the blast to speed,
To those eternal regions, and there tread
From star to star, in plenitude of night,
And through those boundless realms of glory, shed
The lustre of its fame, as 'twere the light
Of that full orb that keeps them in their course aright.

And thus the soul will from the slumber start,
Which steeps its higher powers, and strives to bend
And fetter down in sleep its nobler part;
And like the courser with strength unconfined
Speed onward with the swiftness of the wind;
But all unused to freedom, in the press
Of danger rushing headlong &mdash; wild and blind,
Urged on by foes, or its own mad excess,
Changes insensate sleep for anguish merciless.

Like the exulting king of birds on high,
Spreading his glad wings to the breath of heav'n,
Majestically soaring to the sky
On wings that seemed by angel sisters giv'n,
And tinged with hues, by hands celestial grav'n,
It mov'd so bright before the gazer's eye,
That fancy deemed e'en tempest madly driv'n,
So fair a form would pass unruffled by,
And to a meaner prey, with willing mercy hie.

Alas, how vain our hopes!  The tempest came;
Storms that in realms of fiery rage have birth,
Swept through the air with all devouring flame,
Sparing no beauty's form &mdash; nor mental worth,
But fiercely revelling in feelings dearth;
Swept by their fury from his native skies,
And rudely dashed upon the flinty earth,
Gasping for breath the prostrate eagle lies,
And moans away his life in mortal agonies.
