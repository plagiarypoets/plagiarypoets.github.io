When stout Achilles heard of Helen's Rape,
And what Revenge the States of Greece devis'd;
Thinking, by sleight, the fatal Wars to 'scape,
In Woman's Weeds himself he then disguis'd:
But this Device Ulysses soon did spy,
And brought him forth, the Chance of War to try.

When Spenser saw the Fame was spred so large,
Through Fairy-land, of their renowned Queen;
Loth that his Muse should take so great a Charge,
As in such haughty matter to be seen;
To seem a Shepherd, then he made his Choice:
But Sidney heard him sing, and knew his Voice.

And as Ulysses brought fair Thetis' Son 
From his retired Life, to menage Arms;
So Spenser was by Sidney's Speeches won,
To blaze her Fame, not fearing future Harms:
For well he knew, his Muse would soon be tired
In her high Praise, that all the World admired.

Yet as Achilles in those warlike Frays,
Did win the Palm from all the Grecian Peers
So Spenser now, to his immortal Praise,
Hath won the Laurel quite from all his feers.
What though his Task exceed a humane Wit,
He is excus'd, sith Sidney thought it fit.
