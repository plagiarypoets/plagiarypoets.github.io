Gem of my soul!  my thoughts are still with thee
Where'er my steps may wander, &mdash; near or far
O'er the blue mountains, or the trackless sea;
'Mid life's high revelry, 'mid this world's war,
Thou art the light &mdash; the solitary star
That gleams in beauty spiritually bright,
Shielding a ray divine 'mid things that mar
The harmony of life, till to my sight
Thou seem'st the soul of day, the spirit of the night!

Gem of my soul!  the ocean's pearl, though pure,
Sinks into dimness on that neck of snow!
And I've beheld that spotless brow obscure
The brightest jewels that earth's mines can show;
And when thy soul, deep in those eyes, would glow
With glowing thought &mdash; with eloquence &mdash; with love!
They more than match'd the fairest things below,
And even outshone the brightest things above,
Mingling in one wild glance the eagle and the dove!

Gem of my soul!  be ever what thou'rt now,
By genius polish'd, and by nature fair!
Were aught like thee accorded to my brow,
'Twould never be again the seat of care,
But heaven and love would rest for ever there!
Light would illume my path, and the lone hour
Would never more be mine, my life t' impair;&mdash;
The darkest clime on earth would be a bower
Of heavenly bliss, with thee its light &mdash; its love &mdash; its flower!
