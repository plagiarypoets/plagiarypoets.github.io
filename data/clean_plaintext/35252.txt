Hence!  avaunt, corroding care!
Let content and peace be here;
Ease (ally'd to sisters three,
Leisure, hope, and liberty,)
Winged mirth, who laughing flies,
With dimpled cheeks and roguish eyes;
Or in more methodic hour,
Welcome contemplation's power.

Lo!  the muse, by fancy led,
Joyous seeks the rustic shed,
Flys from what the world calls gay,
Here the hermit's part to play;
At her beck the Dryads move,
Sporting thro' the "checquer'd grove;"
(Fauns with ivy garlands crown'd,)
Gambol o'er the verdant ground,
While, constrain'd by fancy's spell,
Sylphs and fairies haunt the cell.

Here the muse, remote from noise,
Soft tranquility enjoys;&mdash;
Envys not the fair and vain,
Who mix in fashion's busy train,
But wishes, undisturb'd, to prove
A life of reason, and of love.
