And hail to thee, fair Redycina, hail!
Accursed be the Wight whose envious Eye
Could blast the tufted Flow'rs of Isis Vale,
Or wish to drain her chrystal Current dry!
Tho' Granta hears, from sweet Armulla dale,
Lov'd Spenser's Voice, let none of Thee misdeem
That ne'er thy Chiefs were cas'd in Freedom's Mail!
Nor sacred Bards beside thy Margent dream!
Thine Sidney, Hampden, learned Chaucer thine!
And Thou, O Warton, that delight'st to sing
The Triumphs old of Isis' sacred Stream,
Can'st thou awhile thy own sweet Lays resign,
To hear an artless Muse begin her Theme,
Thyself the chosen Priest of Isis' Spring?
