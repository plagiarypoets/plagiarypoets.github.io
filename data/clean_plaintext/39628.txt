'Tis night &mdash; the combat's rage is o'er,
The watch fires blaze from hill to hill,
The bugle-note is heard no more,
But all is solemn, hush'd, and still!
Save where some faint and mournful tone,
Swells on the midnight breeze a dying moan.

How chang'd the scene, where morn beheld
A gallant host in bright array;
Where martial notes exulting swell'd,
To cheer the brave on danger's way:
And hope and valour bade the pulse beat high,
Thrill'd the warm heart and fir'd the kindling eye.

Now the pale beams, by moonlight shed,
A field of blood disclose,
Where on their chill and lowly bed,
The martyr'd brave repose,
And the dead calm, the desolate suspense
With nameless horror chills the shuddering sense.

Thousands are here who sprang to arms,
When the shrill clarion peal'd the strain,
By danger's call or glory's charms,
Ne'er to be roused again.
E'en now whilst shades and stillness reign,
A viewless band are near &mdash; the spirits of the slain.

Whence came that deep tremendous sound,
Whence broke that flash intensely bright?
Bursting the midnight calm profound,
A cannon peal disturbs the night;
'Tis past and deeper is the gloom,
And all again is silent as the tomb.

Glancing by fits on shiver'd steel,
A quiv'ring light the moonbeams throw,
And through the broken clouds reveal
Full many a sight of death and woe;
Gleaming on pallid forms around,
Stretch'd on the soldier's bier, the cold and dewy ground.

Midnight and death o'er all the soil,
A fearful deep repose have spread;
Worn with long hours of martial toil,
The living slumber with the dead.
Nor here the wounded faintly sigh,
Nor dream of those who round them bleed and die.

Rest, slumberers, rest! &mdash; the morn shall wake;
And ye to arms again shall rise!
Your sleep the clarion call shall break,
And life and hope shall fire your eyes&mdash;
But oh!  what thousands strew the battle plain,
Whom day-spring ne'er shall wake, nor war-note rouse again.
