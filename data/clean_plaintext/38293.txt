While POPE to Friendship consecrates the Lyre,
The Loves to hear the Notes assembled throng:
And with the softness of renew'd desire,
Inflame the dear re-animated Song:
Unrivall'd Bard! &mdash; the kindly task forbear,
The Youth before had worth enough to boast;
You ORPHEUS-like, but raise the Syren air;
The British Nymphs approach! &mdash; Your Friend is lost.
Hard fate!  a praise so wish'd as yours to shun,
Or by the fair Encomium risque to be undone.

But oh I err! &mdash; and M&mdash;Y must forgive
A fame that brings such unexampled bliss.
To love is sure the noblest way to live:
Grandeur and wealth are toys compar'd to this.
Descend, dear Youth!  the shining guest await;
For beauty's Queen the roseate bower prepare:
Let her gay smiles adorn thy rising fate,
And soften all the pomp of future care:
And, like ADONIS, boast the envy'd pow'r,
To charm the wise and fair &mdash; which POPE must charm no more.
