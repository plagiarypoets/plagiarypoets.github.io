Celestial shell, whose music might appease
The pangs of guilt, and ease the wretch's care;
O thou, whose sound is love,
Whose every tone delight,

O let me hear thy voice in plaintive melody,
Break on the ebon silence of the night;
As if pois'd in air,
Some wand'ring angels sung.

In her midpath sublime, the queen of night,
In silver majesty, from heav'n looks down,
And seems to stay her course
Awhile, to listen to thy strains.

But ah!  that pause, and then that lengthen'd sweep,
Maddens my brain, and steals away my sense;
It sheds throughout my mind,
A melancholy awe.

And wrapt in strange and pleasing phantasy,
I rise to heaven, and leave the world behind;
Forgetful of its griefs,
And all its cares and fears.

Thus once play'd Orpheus, he whom poets sung,
Whose harp mellifluous, could unbend the frowns,
And soothe the rugged hearts
Of Pluto and his bride,

When melting strains could ope the doors of hell,
To all before fast clos'd, without redress;
And from the realms of night,
Recal a wand'ring shade.

But not e'en he, nor yet the heavenly maid,
Cecilia, may with thee compare, sweet shell;
Not with thy harmony,
So beautifully wild,

Not with such strains of old, Timotheus mov'd
Great Alexander's breast; nor thus sang he,
At whose command, uprose
The lofty walls of Thebes.

Thine is the prize, all else must yield to thee;
Thou, who dost make the very zephyrs sigh
In accents of despair,
Melodiously sweet.

To pass so quickly by; nor stay to hear
Thy magic sounds, that wake the rising morn;
Or swell at fall of eve,
Or at the midnight hour.
