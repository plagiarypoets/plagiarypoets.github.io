O for the Warblings of the Doric Oate,
That wept the Youth deep-whelm'd in Ocean's Tide;
Or for the mournful Muse, whose varying Note
Chanted how dear the laurell'd Sydney dy'd:
Then should my Woes in worthy Strain be sung,
And with due Cypress-Wreath thy Herse, O FRED'RICK, hung!

But tho, my novice-hands are all too weak
To grasp the tuneful Reed, my Voice unskill'd
The graceful Words of Poesy to speak,
Tho' rude the Cadence of my Wood-Notes wild,
Yet shall not tend'rest Duty bid me tell
How great, how just, how good the matchless FRED'RICK fell?

How well he knew to leave the loftier Scene,
To throw the Pomp of purple State aside,
Led by calm Thought to Bow'rs of Eglantine,
And high-arch'd Walks on Thames's sacred Side;
To loose himself in Landscapes lone and still,
Where Contemplation sate on Cliefden's beech-clad Hill?

How lock'd in pure-ey'd Concord's golden Band,
With his bless'd Bride, thro' Wedlock's hallow'd Ways
With even Step he walk'd, and constant Hand,
His Temples binding with domestic Bays;
How in each Science most sublime he shone,
And crop'd the fairest Flow'rs of silver Helicon?

How to sweet Poesy, all-bounteous Lord,
He never barr'd his princely Palace-gate,
But bade his Thomson share the regal-Board,
With classic Converse seas'ning empty State;
Hence felt the exulting Bard a mighty Rage,
With bolder Buskin hence, he dar'd to tread the Stage.
