Young Hodge, a poor, but a contented Swain,
Rented a homely Cottage on a Plain;
Homely, you'd say, if you the Cottage saw,
The Walls were rear'd of Mud, and thatch'd with Straw:
In wond'rous Form at every Corner stood
A mighty Pole lopp'd from a neighb'ring Wood;
Not Columns plac'd for Show and wanton Pride,
But to support with Safety every Side.
For when with furious Blast the North-Wind blew,
Hodge long had thought that Ruin must ensue;
And Landlord nought would give, so lov'd he Pelf,
That Hodge e'en turn'd an Architect himself:
Therefore, as he consulted Use alone,
Laid Parlour, Hall and Kitchen into one.
Well with the Place the Furniture agreed;
No Implements of Luxury, but Need;
Five Wooden Platters in a comely Row,
With eke as many Beechen Spoons below;
An Iron Pot stood open to the View,
By which that he Good-Living kept you knew:
On half one Side the antique Bed was plac'd,
One whole Chair, and three broke, the other grac'd;
All that you cou'd unnecessary call,
Were some old tatter'd Ballads on the Wall:
Alike of Wealth was all his Stock and Store,
Two Bee-Hives (one forsaken) at his Door,
And Cabbages and Turnips half a Score;
A meagre Tit that on the Common graz'd,
A small Runt Cow that from a Calf he rais'd,
One Cock, two Hens, and half a Dozen Chicks,
Two little Heaps of Hay, which Hodge call'd Ricks;
Three Pigs, within Doors kept, and serv'd with Care;
To these &mdash; a Wife &mdash; two Girls &mdash; a Son and Heir:
These were his Stock &mdash; nor did he e'er repine,
Tho' Pigs, Wife, Children, often did combine
To greet his Ears, and in loud Concert join.
But 'midst this Scene of Poverty and Woes,
Hodge by his Looks no Discontentment shows;
He feels no secret Pangs, betrays no Spleen,
But in his Face a blithful Mirth is seen:
At Work he whistles; when his Work is done,
No more is tir'd than when he first begun;
Homeward he hies, and tunes a merry Song,
His lov'd, though dirty squawling Tribe among:
Happy the Day, as happy proves the Night,
And Madge and Hodge experience true Delight;
Nor doubt that both their Pleasures are sincere,
When a brave chopping Child comes every Year.

Such Hodge's Life was, which a neighb'ring 'Squire
Did often with an envious Mind admire;
Wonder'd a Clown in such penurious State
Never repin'd at Heav'n, and curs'd his Fate,
But still was merry, and was still content;
And though his Charge increas'd &mdash; still pay'd his Rent.
&mdash;The 'Squire once caught him felling down an Oak,
And though he toil'd, still sung 'twixt every Stroke:
Pleas'd at his lightsome Heart, began a Chat,
And after some Discourse of this and that;
"Pray Hodge, cries he, as Hardship you endure,
How can you be so merry, and so poor?
You whistle, sing, contented are, and free,
Some Secret sure you have; pray tell it me."
Hodge stops a while, and with a Leer replies,
"You shall the Secret know without Disguise:
Why, when I think of such fine Folk as you,
That ride in Coaches, and have nought to do;
Who live upon the Fat of all the Land,
Have Coaches, Horses, Servants at Command:
Why then, an't please your Worship, in good Faith,
A secret Curse or two my Father hath,
Who under such a Stare a Son begot,
That never will through Life be worth a Groat,
But when I change the Case, and think how few
Have such Estates, and live like one of you;
And yet how many Millions have the Curse
Of my Condition, if not still a worse;
Content, that Work I follow I began,
And still jog on as merry as I can."
