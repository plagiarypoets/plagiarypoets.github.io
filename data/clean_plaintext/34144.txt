As when the Silk-worm, erst the tender Care
Of Syrian Maidens, 'gins for to unfold
From his sleek Sides, that now much sleeker are,
The glossy Treasure, and soft Threads of Gold;
In various Turns, and many a winding Fold,
He spins his Web, and as he spins decays;
'Till within Circles infinite enroll'd,
He rests supine, imprison'd in the Maze,
The which himself did make, the Gathering of his Days.

So thou, they say, from thy prolific Brain,
A Castle, hight of Indolence, didst raise;
Where listless Sprites, withouten Care or Pain,
In idle Pleasaunce spend their jocund Days,
Nor heed rewardfull Toil, nor seeken Praise.
Thither thou didst repair in luckless Hour;
And lulled with thine own enchanting Lays,
Didst lie adown; entranced in the Bow'r,
The which thyself didst make, the Gathering of thy Pow'r.

But Venus suffering not her fav'rite Worm,
For aye to sleepen in his silky Tomb,
Instructs him to throw off his pristine Form,
And the gay Features of a Fly assume;
When, lo!  eftsoons from the surrounding Gloom,
He vigourous breaks, forth issuing from the Wound
His horny Beak had made, and finding Room,
On new-plum'd Wings he flutters all around,
And buzzing speaks his Joy in most expressive Sound.

So may the God of Science and of Wit,
With pitying Eye ken thee his darling Son;
Shake from thy fatty Sides the slumbrous Fit,
In which, alas!  thou art, so woe begon!
Or with his pointed Arrows goad thee on;
'Till thou refeelest Life in all thy Veins;
And, on the Wings of Resolution,
Like thine own Hero dight, fliest o'er the Plains,
Chaunting his peerless Praise in never-dying Strains.
