"Not with more haste the panting doe removes
To closer coverts, and more distant groves,
When on her haunts the prowling wolves encroach,
And tainted breezes tell the foe's approach,
Than Tuxa flies his Agathol to meet,
And lay his sylvan trophies at her feet."
Thus sang Gatuxa, 'mid the echoing grove,
While bending poplars learnt the tale of love.

"Oh!  happy morn, supremely blest," he cries,
"When Agathol first met my ravish'd eyes:
'Twas on the day that joy unrival'd reigns,
And all the fair were gather'd on the plains,
When valiant Mingo led his bride away,
And laughing pleasure rul'd the festive day.

"But see!  she comes!  my Agathola comes!
How shines her forehead, and how slim her thumbs!
What heav'nly charms her tawny breasts unfold!
And neck more yellow than Peruvian gold!
High thro' her nose a painted feather hung,
Words, smooth as acorns, dropping from her tongue,
O'er her sleak form with decent care was spread,
A splendid blanket, strip'd with blue and red;
While bits of tin and brass upon her toes,
With melting clatter, tinkle as she goes.
But ah!  how fruitless are th' attempts to draw
A perfect 'semblance of my peerless squaw.

"Full long the nymph, by noblest motives sway'd,
Withstood my suit, while ling'ring in the shade;
But when bright glory rais'd the tribe to arms,
And all the forest rung with loud alarms,
She willing follow'd all the sultry day,
Nor weep'd, nor grumbled, at the tedious way;
And, urg'd by her, I drew the twanging blow
With tenfold ardor on the flying foe."
