Boy, h'a done; for now my braine
Is inspir'd afresh againe,
And new Raptures pressing are,
To be sung in praise of her:
Whose faire Picture lieth nigh,
Quite unveil'd to ev'ry eye.
No small favour hath it beene,
That such Beautie might be seene:
Therefore, ever may they rue it,
Who with evill eyes shall view it.
Yea, what ancient stories tell,
Once to rude Acteon fell,
(When with evil thoughts, he stood
Eyeing Cynthia in the Flood)
May that fatall horned curse,
Light upon them; or a worse.

But (whatever others be)
Lest some fault be found in me,
If unperfect this remaine,
I will over-trym't againe.
Therefore, turne where we begun:
And now all is overrunne,
Marke, if every thing exprest,
Sute not so unto the rest,
As if Nature would prefer,
All perfections, unto her.
Wherefore seemes it strange to any,
That they daily see so many,
Who were else most perfect Creatures,
In some one part, want true features?
Since, from all the fair'st that live,
Nature tooke the best, to give
Her perfection in each part.
I, alone, except her heart;
For, among all woman-kind,
Such as hers, is hard to find.

If you truely note her Face,
You shall find it hath a grace
Neither wanton, nor ore-serious;
Nor too yeelding, nor imperious:
But, with such a feature blest,
It is that, which pleaseth best:
And delight's each sev'rall eye,
That affects with modesty.
Lowlinesse, hath in her looke,
Equall place with Greatnes tooke.
And, if Beautie anywhere
Claims prerogatives, tis there.
For, at once, thus much twill doe;
Threat, command, perswade, and wooe.

In her Speech there is not found,
Any harsh, unpleasing sound,
But a well-beseeming power;
Neither higher, neither lower,
Than will sute with her perfection.
Tis the Loadstone of Affection.
And, that man, whose judging eyes,
Could well sound such mysteries,
Would in love, make her, his choice;
Though he did but heare her voice.
For, such accents, breathe not, whence
Beautie keeps Non-residence.
Never word of hers I heare,
But tis Musicke to mine eare,
And, much more contentment brings,
Then the sweetly-touched strings,
Of the pleasing Lute, whose straines,
Ravish hearers when it plaines.

Rais'd by her Discourse, I flie,
In contented thoughts so high,
That I passe the common measures,
Of the dulled Senses pleasures:
And, leave farre below my flight,
Vulgar pitches of delight.

If Shee smile, and merry be;
All about her, are as she.
For, each looker on, takes part
Of the joy that's in her heart.

If Shee grieve, or you but spie,
Sadnesse peeping through her eye;
Such a grace it seemes to borrow,
That you'l fall in love with sorrow:
And abhorre the name of Mirth,
As the hatefulst thing on earth.
Should I see her shed a teare,
My poore eyes would melt, I fear.
For, much more in hers appears,
Than in other womens teares;
And her looke, did never feign
Sorrow, where there was no paine.

Seldome hath she been espied
So impatient as to chide:
For, if any see her so,
They'l in love with anger grow.
Sigh, or speake, or smile, or talke,
Sing, or weepe, or sit, or walke,
Everything that she doth doe,
Decent is, and lovely too.
Each part that you shall behold,
Hath within it selfe inrold,
What you could desire to see,
(Or your heart conceive to be)
Yet, if from that part your eye
Moving, shall another spye:
There you see as much or more,
Then you thought to praise before.

While the eye surveys it, you
Will imagine that her Brow
Hath all beautie; when her Cheeke,
You behold, it is as like
To be deemed fairest too.
(So much there can Beautie doe)
Looke but thence upon her eye,
And you wonder, by and by,
How there may be any where,
So much worthy praise as there.
Yet, if you survey her Brest,
Then as freely you'l protest,
That in them perfection is;
Though (I know) that one poore kisse,
From her tempting Lips, would then,
Make all that forsworne agen.
For, the selfe same mooving grace,
Is at once in every place.

She, her Beautie never foyles
With your oyntments, waters, oyles,
Nor no loathsome Fucus settles,
Mixt with Jewish fasting spetles.
Fair by Nature, being borne,
She doth borrowed beautie scorne.
Whoso kisses her, needs feare
No unwholesome varnish there.
For, from thence he onely sips
The pure Nectar, of her lips.
And at once with these he closes,
Melting Rubies, Cherries, Roses.

Then, in her behaviour, she
Striveth but her selfe to be.
Keeping such a decent state,
As indeed she seemes to hate
Precious leasure should be spent,
In abused Complement.
Though she knowes what other doe,
(And can all their Courtship toe)
She, is not in so ill case,
As to need their borrowed grace.

Her Discourses sweeten'd are,
With a kind of artlesse care,
That expresseth greater Art;
Then affected words impart.
So, her gestures (being none
But that freenesse which alone,
Suits the bravenesse of her mind)
Make, her, of her selfe, to find,
Postures more becomming far,
Then the meere acquired, are.

If you marke, when for her pleasure,
Shee vouchsafes to foot a Measure,
Though, with others skill, she pace,
Ther's a sweet delightfull grace,
In her selfe; which doth prefer,
Art, beyond that Art, in her.

Neither needs she beat her wit,
To devise what dressings fit.
Her complexion, and her feature,
So beholding are to Nature,
If she in the Fashions goe,
All the Reason she doth so,
Is; because she would not erre,
In appearing singuler.
Doubtlesse, not for any thought,
That 'twill perfect her, in ought.

Many a dainty-seeming Dame,
Is in native Beauties lame.
Some, are graced by their Tyres,
As their Quoifs, their Hats, their Wyres.
One, a Ruffe doth best become;
Falling-Bands much altreth some.
And their favours, oft, we see,
Changed as their dressings be.
Which, her Beautie never feares:
For, it graceth all she weares.
If ye note her Tyre to-day,
That, doth sute her best, you'l say.
Marke, what she next morn doth weare;
That, becomes her best, you'll sweare.
Yea, as oft as her you see;
Such new graces, still there be:
As, she ever seemeth grac't,
Most by that, she weareth last.
Though, it be the same she wore,
But the very day before.

When she takes her Tyres about her,
(Never halfe so rich without her)
At the putting on of them,
You may liken every Jem,
To those lamps, which at a play,
Are set up to light the day.
For their lustre adds no more,
To what Titan gave before;
Neither doth their pretty gleamings,
Hinder ought, his greater beamings.
And yet (which is strange to me)
When those costly deckings be,
Laid away; there seemes descrid,
Beauties, which those Vailes did hide.
And, she lookes, as doth the Moone,
Past some Clowd through which she shone:
Or, some Jewell Watch, whose Case,
Set with Diamonds, seemes to grace
What it doth containe within:
Till the curious worke be seene,
Then; tis found, that costly shrining;
Did but hinder tother's shining.

If you chance to be in place,
When her Mantle she doth grace;
You would presently protest,
Irish dressings were the best.
If againe she lay it downe,
While you view her in a gowne:
And how those her dainty limbs,
That close-bodied garment trims.
You would sweare, and sweare agen:
She appeared loveliest then.

But, if she so truly faire,
Should untie her shining haire,
And at length, that treasure shed;
Joves endured Ganimed,
Neither Cythereas Joy,
Nor the sweet selfe-loving Boy
(Who in beauty did surpasse)
Nor the fair'st that ever was:
Could, to take you prisoner bring,
Lookes so sweetly conquering.

She, excells her, whom Appollo,
Once with weeping eies did follow.
Or that Nimph, who, shut in Towers,
Was beguild with golden showers;
Yea, and She, whose love was wont,
To swime ore the Hellespont.
For her sake (though in attire,
Fittest to enflame desire)
Seem'd not halfe so faire to be,
Nor so lovely, as is she.
For, the man whose happy eye,
Viewes her in full Majesty:
Knowes, she hath a power that mooves,
More then doth the Queene of Loves,
When she useth all her power,
To inflame her Paramour.

And, sometime I doe admire,
All men burne not with desire.
Nay, I muse her servants are not
Pleading love; but oh they dare not.
And, I therefore wonder, why
They doe not grow sicke, and die.

Sure they would doe so, but that
By the ordinance of Fate,
There is some concealed thing,
So, each gazer limiting;
He can see no more of merit,
Then beseemes his worth, and spirit.
For, in her a Grace there shines,
That o're-daring thoughts confines;
Making worthlesse men dispaire,
To be lov'd of one so faire.
Yea, the Destinies agree,
Some good judgments blind should be,
And not gain the power of knowing
Those rare Beauties in her growing.
Reason doth as much imply:
For, if every judging eye,
(Which beholdeth her) should there,
Find what excellencies are:
All, orecome by those perfections,
Would be captive to affections.
So, in happinesse unblest;
Shee, for Lovers, should not rest.
This, well heeding, thinke upon:
And, if there be any one,
Who alloweth not the worth,
Which my Muse hath painted forth;
Hold it no defect in her;
But that hee's ordained to erre.
Or, if any female wight,
Should detract from this I write,
Shee, I yeeld, may shew her wit,
But disparage her no whit.
For, on earth few women be,
That from Envies touch are free.
And, who ever, Envy knew,
Yeeld those honours that were due?

Though sometime my Song I raise,
To unused heights of praise,
(And breake forth as I shall please
Into strange Hyperboles)
Tis to shew, Conceit hath found,
Worth, beyond expressions bound.
Though, her breath I doe compare,
To the sweet'st perfumes that are;
Or, her Eies that are so bright,
To the morning's cheereful light.
Yet, I doe it not so much,
To inferre that she is such;
As to shew, that being blest,
With what merrits name of best,
She appeares more faire to me,
Then all Creatures else that be.

Her true beauty leaves behind,
Apprehensions in my mind,
Of more sweetnes then all Art,
Or inventions can impart.
Thoughts, too deepe to be exprest,
And too strong to be supprest.
Which, oft raiseth my conceits,
To so unbeleeved heights;
That (I feare) some shallow braine,
Thinkes my Muses doe but faine.
Sure, he wrongs them if he doe:
For, could I have reached to
So like Straines, as these you see,
Had there beene no such as She?
Is it possible that I,
Who scarce heard of Poesie;
Should a meare Idea raise,
To as true a pitch of praise,
As the learned Poets could,
Now, or in the times of old;
All those reall beauties bring,
Honourd by their Sonneting?
(Having Arts, and favours to,
More t' encourage what they doe)
No; if I had never seene,
Such a beauty; I had beene
Piping in the Country shades,
To the homely Dairy-maides:
For a Country Fidler's fees;
Clouted creame, and bread and cheese.

I no skill in Numbers had,
More than every Shepheards Lad,
Till She taught me, Straines that were,
Pleasing to her gentle eare.
Her faire splendor, and her worth,
From obscurenes, drew me forth.
And, because I had no Muse,
Shee her selfe daignd to infuse
All the skill, by which I climb,
To these praises in my Ryme.
Which, if she had pleasd to add
To that Art sweet Drayton had,
Or that happy Swaine that shall
Sing Britanias Pastorall;
Or to theirs, whose verse set forth
Rosalind, and Stella's worth;
They had doubled all their skill
Gained on Apollos Hill:
And, as much more set her forth,
As I'me short of them in worth.
They, had unto heights aspired,
Might have justly been admired;
And, in such brave Straines had moved,
As of all had been approved.

I, must praise her as I may;
Which I doe mine owne rude way:
Sometime setting forth her glories,
By unheard of Allegories.
Thinke not, tho, my Muse now sings,
Meere absurd, or fained things.
If to gold I like her Haire,
Or, to Starres, her Eyes so faire:
Though I praise her Skin by snow,
Or, by Pearles, her double-Row:
Tis, that you might gather thence,
Her unmatched excellence.

Eyes, as faire (for eyes) hath she
As starres faire for starres may be.
And, each part as faire doth show,
In it kind, as white in Snow.
Tis no grace to her at all,
If her Haire I Sunne-beames call:
For, were there a power in Art,
So to pourtrait every part,
All men might those beauties see,
As they doe appear to me.
I would scorne to make compare
With the glorioust things that are.

Nought I ere saw, faire enow,
But the Haire, the haire to show.
Yet, some thinke him overbold,
That compares it but to Gold.
He, from Reason seemes to erre,
Who commending of his Deare,
Gives her Lips the Rubies hue,
Or by Pearles her teeth doth shew.
But what Pearles, what Rubies can
Seeme so lovely faire, to man,
As her Lipps whom he doth love,
When in sweete discourse they move?
Or her lovelier Teeth the while,
She doth blesse him with a smile.

Starres indeed, faire Creatures be:
Yet, amongst us, where is he,
Joyes not more the while he lies,
Sunning in his Mistresse Eies,
Then in all the glimmering light,
Of a starrie winters night?

Him to flatter, most suppose,
That preferrs before the Rose
Or the Lillies (while they grow)
Or the flakes of new-falne snow;
Her complexion whom he loveth:
And yet, this my Muse approveth.
For, in such a beauty, meets
Unexpressed moving sweets;
That, (the like unto them) no man,
Ever saw but in a Woman.
Looke on Moone, on Starrs, on Sunne,
All Gods Creatures over-runne.
See, if all of them presents,
To your mind, such sweet contents:
Or, if you from them can take
Ought that may a beauty make,
Shall one halfe so pleasing prove,
As is Hers, whom you doe love.
For indeed, if there had beene
Other mortall Beauties seene,
Objects for the love of man,
Vaine was their creation than.
Yea, if this could well be granted,
Adam might his Eve have wanted.
But a woman is the Creature,
Whose proportion with our nature
Best agrees; and whose perfections,
Sympathize with our affections:
And not onely finds our Senses,
Pleasure in their excellencies.
But our Reason also knowes,
Sweetnesse in them, that outgoes
Humane wit to comprehend,
Much more, truely, to commend.

Note, the Beautie of an Eye;
And, if ought you praise it by,
Leave such passion in your mind,
Let my Reasons eye be blind.
Marke, if ever red or white,
Any where, gave such delight,
As when they have taken place,
In a worthy womans face.
He that so much hath not noted,
Will not:  or is growne besotted.

Such as Lovers are, conceave,
What impressions Beauty leave;
And those Hearts, that fire have took,
By a love-enflaming looke:
Those, beleeve, what here I say;
And suppose not that I stray,
In a word, by setting foorth
Any praise beyond true worth.

And yet, wherefore should I care,
What anothers Censures are,
Since I know her to be such,
As no praise can be too much?
All that see her, will agree,
In the selfe same mind with me;
If their wit be worth the having,
Or their Judgement merrit craving.
And the man that kens her not,
Speaks, at best, he knowes not what:
So, his Envy, or good will,
Neither doth her good, nor ill.

Then Fooles cavils I disdaine,
And, call backe my Muse againe,
To decipher out the rest.
For I have too long digrest.

This is Shee, in whom there meets,
All varietie of sweets.
An epitomie, of all,
That on earth we Faire may call.
Nay, yet more I dare aver:
He that is possest of her,
Shall at once all pleasure find,
That is reapt from Woman-kind.

Oh, what man would further range,
That in one might finde such change?
What dull eye such worth can see,
And not sworne a Lover be?
Or, from whence was he, could prove,
Such a Monster in his love;
As, in thought to use amisse,
Such unequald worth as this?
Pitie 'twere that such a Creature,
Phenix-like, for matchlesse feature,
Should so suffer, or be blamed,
With what now the Times are shamed.

Beautie (unto me divine)
Makes my honest thoughts encline,
Unto better things, than that,
Which the Vulgar aymeth at.
And, I vow, I grieve to see,
Any Faire, and false to be:
Or, when I sweet pleasures find,
Matcht with a defiled mind.
But (above all others) Her,
So much doth my soule prefer;
That to Him whose ill desire
Should so nurse a lawlesse Fire,
As to tempt, to that, which might
Dimme her sacred Virtues light;
I could wish that he might die
Ere he did it; though 'twere I.

For, if Shee should hap to stray,
All this Beautie would away:
And not her alone undo,
But kill him, that prais'd her to.
But, I know her Maker will
Keepe her undistained still:
That ensuing Ages may
Patterne out, by her the way
To all goodnesse.  And if Fate
That appoints all things a Date
Heare me would; I'de wish that She
Might for aye preserved be.
And that neither wasting Cares,
Neither all-consuming Yeares,
Might, from what she is, estrange her,
Or in mind, or body change her.
For, oh why should envious Time,
Perpetrate so vile a Crime,
As to waste, or wrong, or staine,
What shall ne're be matcht againe?

Much I Hope, it shall not be:
For, if Love deceive not me,
To that height of Faire she growes,
Age, or Sicknesse (Beauties foes)
Cannot so much wrong it there,
But enough there will appeare,
Ever worthy to be lov'd:
And, that heart shall more be mov'd,
(Where there is a judging eye)
With those prints it doth espie,
Of her beautie wrongd by Time,
Then by others, in their prime.

One advantage shee hath more,
That adds grace to all before.
It is this; her Beauties fame,
Hath not done her honour shame.
For, where Beautie we doe find,
Envy still is so unkind,
That, although their Vertues are
Such, as passe their Beauties farre;
Yet on Slanders rocks they be
Shipwrackt oftentimes, we see:
And are subject to the wrongs,
Of a thousand spitefull tongues,
When the greatest fault they had,
Was, that some would make them bad;
And not finding them for action,
Sought for vengeance, by detraction.

But her beauty sure no tongue,
Is so villanous to wrong.
Never did the Jealoust eare,
Any muttering rumor heare,
That might cause the least suspects,
Of indifferent defects.
And (which somewhat stranger is)
They, whose slanders few can misse,
(Though set on by evill will,
And habituated ill)
Nothing can of her invent,
Whence to frame disparagement.
Which, if we respect the Crimes,
Of these loose injurious times;
Doth not onely truly prove,
Great discretion in her love:
And, that she hath liv'd upright,
In each jealous tongues dispite.
But, it must be understood,
That her private thoughts are good.
Yea, tis an apparant signe,
That her beautie is Divine:
And, that Angels have a care,
Mens polluting tongues should spare
To defile, what God hath given,
To be deare to Earth, and Heaven.

Tell me you that heare me now;
Is there any one of you,
Wanteth feeling of affection?
Or that loves not such perfection?
Can there be so dull an eare,
As of so much worth to heare;
And not seriously incline,
To this Saint-like friend of mine?
If there be; the fault doth lie,
In my artlesse Poesy.
For, if I could reach the Straine,
Which me thinkes I might obtaine;
Or, but make my Measures flie,
Equall with my fantasie;
I would not permit an eare,
To attend unravisht heere;
If, but so much sense it knew,
As the blocks, that Orpheus drew.

Thinke on this description, well,
And, your noblest Ladyes tell;
Which of you (that worth can see)
This my Mistresse would not be?

You brave English, who have run,
From the rising of the Sun:
Till in travelling you found,
Where he doth conclude his Round.
You, that have the beauties seene,
Which in farthest Lands have beene;
And surveid the faire resorts,
Of the French and Spanish Courts:
(With the best that Fame renownes.
In the rich Trans-Alpine Townes)
Doe not with our brainlesse Fry,
(That admire each novelty)
Wrong your Countries fame in ought.
But, here freely speake your thought;
And I durst presume you'll sweare,
Shee's not matched any where.

Gallants, you that would so faine,
Nymphs and Ladies loves obtaine.
You, that strive to serve and please,
Fairest Queenes and Empresses.
Tell me this, and tell me right;
If you would not (so you might)
Leave them all despis'd, to prove,
What contents are in her love?

Could your Fathers ever tell,
Of a Nymph did more excell?
Or hath any storie told,
Of the like, in times of old?
Dido was not such a one.
Nor the Trojans Paragone.
Though they so much favour found,
As to have their honors crownd,
By the best of Poets penns,
Ever knowne before, or since.

For had Dido beene so faire,
Old Anchises' noble heire;
Joves command had disobaid:
And with her in Carthage staied:
Where, he would have quite forswore,
Seeing the Lavinian Shore.
Or, had Laedas daughter beene,
(When she was the Spartan Queene)
Equall with this lovely-one,
Menelaus had never gone,
From her sight so farre away,
As to leave her for a pray;
And his roome, to be possest,
By her wanton Phrygian guest.

But, lest yet among you, some,
Thinke she may behind these, come:
Stay a little more, and here me:
In another straine Ile reare me.
Ile unmasque a beauty, now,
Which to kisse, the Gods may bow.
And so feelingly did move,
That your soules shall fall in love.

I have yet, the best behind;
Her most faire, unequald, Minde.
This, that I have here exprest,
Is but that, which vailes the rest.
An incomparable shrine,
Of a Beauty more divine.

Whereof, ere I farther speake,
Off againe, my Song Ile breake.
And, if you among the Roses,
(Which, yon quickset hedge incloses)
Will with plucking flowres, beguile
Tedious-seeming Time awhile;
Till I step to yonder Greene,
(Whence the sheep so plaine are seen)
I, will be returned, ere
You an howre have stayd there.
And, excuse me now, I pray,
Though I rudely go away.
For, Affaires I have to doe:
Which, unlesse I looke into;
I may sing out Summer here,
Like the idle Grasshopper,
And at Winter, hide my head,
Or else fast, till I am dead.

Yet if Rusticke Past'rall Measures,
Can aught adde unto your pleasures;
I will leave you some of those,
Which, it pleasd me to compose,
When dispairing fits were over;
And I made a happy Lover,
Exercisd my loving passion,
In an other kind of fashion,
Then to utter, I devised,
When I fear'd to be despised.

Those; shall lye in gage for me,
Till I backe returned be.
And, in writing; here, you have them:
Either Sing, or Read, or leave them.

SONNET 1.
Admire not, Shepheards Boy,
Why I my Pipe forbeare;
My sorrowes, and my joy,
Beyond expression are.
Though others may
In Songs display
Their passions, when they wooe:
Yet, mine doe flie,
A pitch too high
For words to reach unto.

If such weake thoughts as those,
With others fancies move,
Or, if my breast did close,
But common Straines of Love:
Or passions store,
Learnd me no more,
To feele then others doe:
I'de paint my cares,
As blacke as theirs,
And teach my Lynes to wooe.

But oh!  thrice happy yee,
Whose meane conceit is dull;
You from those thoughts are free,
That stuffe my breast so full:
My love's excesse,
Lets to expresse,
What Songs are used to:
And my delights,
Take such high flights,
My Joyes will me undoe.

I have a Love that's faire,
Rich, Wise, and Nobly borne;
Shee's true Perfections heire,
Holds nought but Vice in scorne.
A heart to find,
More chast, more kind,
Our Plaines afford no moe.
Of her degree,
No blab Ile be,
For doubt, some Prince should wooe.

And yet I doe not feare,
(Though shee my meannesse knowes)
The Willow Branch to weare,
No, nor the yellow hose.
For, if great Jove,
Should sue for love,
Shee would not me forego
Resort I may,
By night or day,
Which braver, dare not doe.

You Gallants, borne to pelfe,
To Lands, to Titles store;
Ime borne but to my Selfe,
Nor doe I care for more.
Adde to your earth,
Wealth, Honors, Birth,
And all you can thereto;
You cannot prove,
That height of Love,
Which, I in meannesse do.

Great Men have helpes to gaine,
Those favours they implore;
Which, though I winne with paine,
I finde my joyes the more.
Each Clowne may rise,
And climbe the Skies,
When he hath found a Staire:
But joy to him,
That dares to climbe,
And hath no helpe, but ayre.

Some say, that Love repents,
Where Fortunes disagree;
I know the high'st contents,
From low beginnings be.
My love's unfain'd,
To her that daignd,
From Greatnesse, stoope thereto.
Shee loves cause I,
So meane, dar'd trie,
Her better worth to wooe.

And yet although much joy,
My Fortune seemes to blesse;
Tis mixt with more annoy,
Then I shall ere expresse:
For, with much paine
Did I obtaine,
The Jem Ile nere foregoe:
Which, yet I dare
Nor shew, nor weare;
And that breeds all my woe.

But fie, my foolish tongue,
How loosely now it goes!
First, let my Knell be rung,
Ere I doe more disclose.
Mounts thoughts on high;
Cease words, for why:
My meaning to divine:
To those I leave,
That can conceive,
So brave a Love as mine.

And now, no more Ile sing,
Among my fellow Swaines:
Nor Groves, nor Hilles shall ring,
With Ecchoes of my plaines.
My Measures be
Confused (you see)
And will not sute thereto:
Cause, I have more,
Brave thoughts in store,
Then words can reach unto.

SONNET 2.
Hence, away, you Syrens, leave me,
And unclaspe your wanton Armes;
Sugred words shall ne're deceive me,
(Though thou prove a thousand Charmes)
Fie, fie, forbeare;
No common snare,
Could ever my affection chaine:
Your painted baits,
And poore deceits,
Are all bestowed on me, in vaine.

I'me no slave, to such as you be;
Neither shall a snowy Brest,
Wanton Eye, or Lip of Ruby,
Ever robb me of my rest.
Goe, goe, display,
Your Beauties ray,
To some ore-soone enamour'd Swaine.
Those common wiles,
Of sighs and smiles;
Are all bestow'd on me, in vaine.

I have elsewhere, vow'd a dutie;
Turne away thy tempting eyes.
Shew not me, a naked Beautie,
Those Impostures I despise.
My Spirit lothes,
Where gawdy clothes,
And fained Othes, may love obtaine.
I love her so,
Whose looke, sweares No;
That, all your labours will be vaine.

Can he prize the tainted Posies,
Which on every brest are worne;
That may plucke the spotlesse Roses,
From their never-touch'd Thorne?
I can goe rest,
On her sweet Brest,
That is the pride of Cynthia's traine.
Then hold your tongues,
Your Mermaid Songs,
Are all bestow'd on me in vaine.

Hee's a foole, that basely dallies,
Where each Peasant mates with him.
Shall I haunt the thronged Vallies,
Whilst ther's noble Hils to climbe?
No, no, though Clownes
Are skar'd with frownes,
I know the best can but disdaine
And those Ile prove;
So shall your Love
Be all bestowed, on me in vaine.

Yet, I would not daigne embraces,
With the greatest-fairest Shee,
If another shar'd those graces,
Which had beene bestowed on Me.
I gave that One,
My Love, where none,
Shall come to robb me of my gaine.
Your fickle Hearts
Makes Teares. and Arts,
And all, bestow'd on me in vaine.

I doe scorne, to vow a Dutie,
Where each lustfull Lad may wooe.
Give me Her, whose Sun-like Beautie,
Buzzards dare not soare unto.
Shee, shee it is
Affoords that Blisse,
For which, I would refuse no paine.
But such as you,
Fond fooles, adue;
You seeke to captive me in vaine.

Prowd she seem'd in the beginning,
And disdained my looking on:
But, that coy one in the winning,
Proves a true one being wonne.
What ere betide,
Shee'l ne'er divide,
The favour shee to me shall daigne.
But, your fond love,
Will fickle prove:
And all that trust in you, are vaine.

Therefore know, when I enjoy one,
(And for love employ my breath)
Shee I Court shall be a Coy one,
Though I winne her with my death.
A favour there,
Few ayme at dare.
And if perhaps, some Lover plaine,
She is not wonne,
Nor I undone,
By placing of my love in vaine.

Leave me then, you Syrens leave me;
Seeke no more to worke my harmes:
Craftie wiles cannot deceive me;
Who am proofe against your Charmes.
You labour may,
To lead astray,
The heart, that constant shall remaine:
And I the while,
Will sit and smile,
To see you spend your time in vaine.

SONNET 3.
When Philomela with her straines,
The Spring had welcom'd in;
And Flora, to bestrow the Plaines,
With Daysies did begin:
My Love, and I (on whom suspicious eyes
Had set a thousand spies)
To cosen Argos strove;
And seene of none,
We got alone,
Into a shady Grove.

On every Bush, the Eglantine,
With leaves perfumed hung.
The primrose made the hedgerows fine,
The woods of Musicke rung.
The Earth, the Aire, and all things did conspire
To raise contentment higher.
That, had I come to wooe:
Nor meanes of grace,
Nor time, nor place;
Were wanting thereunto.

With hand in hand alone we walkt,
And oft each other eyde:
Of Love, and passions past, we talkt,
Which our poore hearts had tride.
Our soules, infus'd into each other were:
And, what may be her care,
Did my more sorrow breed.
One mind we bore;
One faith we swore:
And both in one agreed.

Her dainty palm I gently prest,
And with her Lips I plaid.
My cheeke, upon her panting Brest,
And on her Necke I laid.
And yet, we had no sence of wanton lust:
Nor, did we then mistrust,
The poyson in the sweet.
Our Bodies wrought
So close, we thought,
Because our Soules should meet.

With pleasant toyle, we breathless grew;
And kist in warmer blood:
Upon her Lips, the Hony-dew,
Like drops on Roses stood;
And on those Flowers, plaid I the busie Bee;
Whose sweets, were such to me,
Them could I not foregoe.
No, not to feast,
On Venus breast;
Whence Streames of sweetnesse flow.

But, kissing and embracing, we
So long together lay;
Her touches all inflamed me,
And I began to stray.
My hands, presum'd so farre, they were too bold
My tongue, unwisely told
How much my heart was chang'd.
And Virtue quite,
Was put to flight,
Or, for the time estrang'd.

Oh!  what are we, if in our strength,
Wee over-boldly trust?
The strongest forts, will yeeld at length,
And so our Virtues must.
In Me, no force of Reason had prevaild;
If shee had also faild.
But ere I further straied,
She sighing kist,
My naked wrist;
And thus, in teares she said.

Sweetheart (quoth she) if in thy brest,
Those Virtues reall bee,
Which hitherto thou hast profest,
And I beleev'd in thee:
Thy Selfe, and Me, oh, seeke not to abuse.
Whilst Thee I thus refuse,
In hotter flames I frie:
Yet, let us not,
Our true love spot,
Oh, rather let mee die.

For, if thy heart should fall from good,
What would become of mine?
As strong a passion, stirres my blood,
As can distemper thine.
Yet, in my brest this rage I smoother would,
Though it consume me should;
And my desires containe:
For, where we see,
Such breaches be,
They seldome stop againe.

Are we the two, that have so long,
Each other's loves imbrac't?
And never did Affection wrong,
Nor thinke a thought unchast?
And shall, oh, shall we now, our matchlesse Joy,
For one poore touch destroy?
And all content foregoe?
Oh no, my Deare;
Sweet heart, forbeare;
I will not loose thee so.

For, should we doe a deed so base,
(As it can never be)
I could no more have seene thy face,
Nor wouldst thou looke on me.
I should of all our passions grow asham'd;
And blush when thou art nam'd,
Yea (though thou constant wert)
I being nought,
A jealous thought,
Would still torment my heart.

What goodly thing doe we obtaine,
If I consent to thee?
Rare joyes we loose, and what we gaine,
But common pleasures be:
Yea, those (some say) who are to lust enclind,
Drive Love out of the mind;
And so much Reason misse:
That they admire,
What kind of fire,
A chast affection is.

No vulgar blisse, I aimed at,
When first I heard thee wooe:
Ile never prize a man for that,
Which every Groome can doe.
If that be love, the basest men that be,
Doe love as well as we,
Who, if we beare us well,
Doe passe them then,
As Angels, men,
In glory doe excell.

Whilst thus she spake, a cruell Band
Of Passions ceazd my Soule:
And, what one seemed to command,
Another did controule.
Twixt Good, and Ill, I did divided lie.
But, as I rais'd mine eye,
In her me thought I saw,
Those virtues shine,
Whose rayes divine,
First gave Desire, a Law.

With that, I felt the blush of shame,
Into my cheeke returne;
And Love, did with a chaster flame,
Within my Bosome burne.
My Soule, her light of Reason had renew'd;
And by those Beames I view'd
How slily Lust ensnares:
And all the fires,
Of ill Desires,
I quenched with my Teares.

Goe Wantons now, and flout at this,
My coldnesse, if you list;
Vaine fooles, you never knew the blisse,
That doth in Love consist.
You sigh, and weepe, and labour to enjoy;
A Shade, a Dreame, a Toy.
Poore Folly you pursue;
And are unblest,
Since every beast,
In pleasure equals you.

You never tooke so rich content,
In all your wanton play,
As this to me hath pleasure lent,
That Chast she went away.
For as some sinnes, which we committed have;
Sharpe stings behind them leave,
Whereby we vexed are:
So, ill supprest,
Begetteth rest,
And peace, without compare.

But lest this Conquest slight you make,
Which on my selfe I wonne,
Twelve labors, I will undertake,
With Joves victorious Sonne,
Er'e I, will such another brunt endure.
For, had Diana pure,
Thus tempted beene to sinne;
That Queene of Night,
(With her chast light,)
Had scarce, a Maiden binne.

Oh!  how honour'd are my Songs,
Grac't by your melodious tongues?
And how pleasing doe they seeme,
Now your voices Caroll them?
Were not, yet, that taske to doe,
Which my word injoyns me to,
I should begge of you, to heare,
What your owne inventions were.

But, (before I ought will crave)
What I promis'd, you shall have.
And, as I on mortall Creatures,
Cald, to view her bodies features;
Shewing how, to make the Senses,
Apprehend her excellences.
Now; I speake of no worse subject,
Than a Soules, and Reasons object:
(And relate a Beauties glories,
Fitting heavenly Auditories)
Therefore, whilst I sit and sing,
Hemme me Angels, in a Ring.
Come, ye Spirits, which have eies,
That can gaze on Deityes:
And unclog'd, with brutish sences,
Comprehend such excellences.
Or, if any mortall eare,
Would be granted leave to heare,
(And find profit with delight,
In what now, I shall indite)
Let him first be sure, to season
A prepared hart with reason:
And, with Judgement, drawing nigh,
Lay all fond affections by.
So, through all her vailings, He
Shall the Soule of beautie see.

But, avoid you earth-bred Wights,
Cloid with sensuall appetites.
On base objects glut your eies,
Till your starveling pleasure dies.
Feede your ears with such delights,
As may match your gross conceits;
For, within your muddie braine,
These, you never can containe.

Thinke not, you, who by the sence,
Only judge of excellence;
(Or doe all contentment place,
In the beauty of a face)
That these higher thoughts of our,
Soare so base a pitch as your.
I can give, as well as you,
Outward Beauties all their due:
I can most contentments see,
That in love, or women be.

Though I dote not on the features,
Of our daintiest female creatures;
(Nor, was ere so void of shames,
As to play their lawlesse games)
I more prize a snowye Hand,
Then the gold on Tagus strand
And a daintie Lippe before,
All the greatest Monarcks store.
Yea, from these I reape as true,
And as large contents as you.

Yet, to them I am not tide.
I have rarer sweets espide;
(Wider prospects of true pleasure)
Then your curbed thoughts can measure.
In her Soule my Soule descries,
Objects, that may feede her eyes.
And the beautiy of her mind,
Shewes my Reason where to finde,
All my former pleasure doubled.
Neither with such passion troubled;
As wherewith it oft was crost,
Nor so easie to be lost.

I, that ravisht lay, wel-nigh,
By the lustre of her eye:
And, had almost sworne affection,
To the fore exprest perfection;
As if nothing had been higher,
Whereunto I might aspire.
Now have found, by seeking nearer,
Inward worth; that shining clearer;
(By a sweet and secret moving)
Drawes me to a dearer loving.
And, whilst I that love conceive,
Such impressions it doth leave
In the Intellective part;
As, defaceth from my hart,
Ev'rie thought of those delights,
Which allure base appetits.
And, my mind so much imploies
In contemplating, those joyes,
Which a purer sight, doth find,
In the beauty of her Mind:
That, I so thereon am set,
As (me thinkes) I could forget,
All her sweetest outward graces:
Though I lay in her imbraces.

But, some thinking with a smile,
What, they would have done the while:
Now suppose my words are such,
As exceed my power too much.
For, all those our Wantons hold
Void of Vigour, dull, and cold:
Or (at best) but fooles, whose flame,
Makes not way unto their shame.
Though at length with griefe they see
They the fooles doe prove to be.

These, the body so much minded,
That their Reason over-blinded,
By the pleasures of the Sence,
Hides from them that excellence;
And that sweetnes, whose true worth,
I am here to blazon forth.

Tis not; tis not those rare graces,
That doe lurke in womens faces.
Tis not, a displayd perfection,
Youthful eyes, nor cleare complexion;
Nor a skin, smooth-satten like,
Nor a daintie Rosie cheeke,
That to wantonnesse can move,
Such as vertuously doe love.
Beautie, rather gently drawes
Wild Desires to Reasons Lawes;
And oft frights men from that sin,
They had else transgressed in:
Through a sweet amazement, stroke,
From an over-ruling looke.
Beautie, never tempteth men
To lasciviousnes; but when
Carelesse Idlenesse hath brought
Wicked longings into thought.
Nor doth youth, or heat of blood,
Make men proove what is not good.
Nor the strength, of which they vaunt.
Tis the strength, and power they want,
And the basenesse of the Mind,
Makes their bruit desires enclind,
To pursue those vaine delights,
Which affect their Appetites.
And so blinded doe they grow,
(Who are overtaken so)
As their dulnes cannot see,
Nor beleeve that better be.
Some, have blood as hot as their,
Whose affections loosest are;
Bodies that require no art,
To supply weake Natures part.
Youth they have; and, sure, might to,
Boast of what, some (shamelesse do)
Yet, their Minds that aime more high,
(Then those baser pleasures lye)
Taught by Virtue can suppresse,
All attempts of wantonnesse.
And such powerfull motives frame,
To extinguish Passions flame;
That (by Reasons good direction)
Quallifying loose affection;
Theile in midst of Beauties fires,
Walke unscorcht of ill Desires.

Yet, no such, as stupid shame,
Keeps from actions worthy blame.
But, in all so truly Man,
That their apprehensions can,
Prize the bodies utmost worth:
And, find many pleasures forth,
In those Beauties; more than You,
That abuse them, ever knew.

But, perhaps her outward grace,
Here describ'd, hath tane such place,
In some ore-enamourd breast,
And so much his hart possest,
As He thinkes it passeth telling,
How shee may be more excelling:
Or what worth, I can prefer,
To be more admir'd in Her.
Therefore, now I will be briefe,
To prevent that misbeliefe.
And, if there be present here,
Any one, whose nicer eare:
Taskes my Measures, as offending,
In too seriously commending
What affects the Sense; or may,
Injure Virtue any way.
Let them know; tis understood,
That if they were truly good,
It could never breed offence,
That I shewd the excellence,
With the power of God and Nature,
In the beauty of his Creature.
They from thence would rather raise,
Cause, to meditate his praise:
And thus thinke; How faire must He,
That hath made this Faire-one be!

That; was my proposed End.
And, to make them more attend
Unto this; so much excelling,
As it passeth meanes of telling.

But at worst; if any Straine,
Makes your Memories retaine,
Sparks of such a banefull fire,
As may kindle ill desire:
This, that followes after, shall
Not alone extinguish all;
But, ev'n make you blush with shame,
That your thoughts were so to blame.
Yet, I know when I have done,
(In respect of that bright Sunne,
Whose inestimable light
I would blazon to your sight)
These ensuing flashes, are,
As to Cynthia's beames a Starre;
Or a petty Comets ray,
To the glorious Eye of Day.
For, what power of words or Art,
Can her worth at full impart?
Or, what is there, may be found,
Plac'd within the Senses bound;
That can paint those sweets to me,
Which the Eyes of Love doe see?
Or the Beauties of that Mind,
Which her body hath enshrin'd?

Can I thinke, the Guide of Heaven,
Hath so bountifully given,
Outward features, cause He meant,
To have made lesse excellent,
Her divine part?  Or suppose,
Beautie, Goodnesse doth oppose;
Like those fooles, who doe despair,
To find any Good and Faire?
Rather; There I seeke a mind,
Most excelling, where I find
God hath to the body lent,
Most beseeming Ornament.
But, though he that did inspire
First, the true Promethean fire,
In each severall soule did place
Equall Excellence and Grace,
As some thinke; yet have not they
Equall Beauties every way.
For, they more or lesse appeare,
As the outward Organs are:
Following much the temp'rature
Of the Body, grosse or pure.
And I doe beleeve it true,
That, as we the body view
Nearer to perfection grow;
So, the Soule her selfe doth show:
Others more, and more excelling,
In her powre; as in her dwelling.
For that purenesse giveth way,
Better to disclose each ray
To the Dull conceit of man,
Than a grosser substance can.
Thus, through spotlesse Christal, wee
May the Dayes full glory see;
When, if clearest Sunbeames passe,
Through a foule polluted glasse:
So discolourd, the'll appeare;
As those Staines they shone through, were.

Let no Critticke cavill then,
If I dare affirm agan;
That her Mind's perfections are
Fairer than her Bodies farr;
And, I need not prove it by,
Axioms of Philosophy,
Since no proofe can better be,
Then their rare effect in me.
For, while other men complaining,
Tell their Mistresses disdaining:
Free from care, I write a storie,
Only of her worth and glory.

While most Lovers pining sit,
(Rob'd of libertie and wit)
Vassaling themselves with shame,
To some proud imperious Dame:
Or, in Songs their Fate bewailing,
Shew the world their faithles fayling,
I, enwreath'd with boughs of Myrtle,
Fare like the beloved Turtle.

Yea while most, are most untoward,
Peevish, vaine, inconstant, froward,
While their best contentments bring,
Nought but after-sorrowing.
She, those childish humours slighting,
Hath conditions so delighting,
And doth so my blisse indeavour,
As my joy increaseth ever.

By her actions I can see,
That her Passions so agree,
Unto Reason; as they erre,
Seldome, to distemper her.

Love she can (and doth) but so,
As she will not overthrow,
Loves content by any folly,
Or, by deeds that are unholy.
Dotingly she ne'er affects;
Neither willingly neglects
Honest love:  But meanes doth find,
With discretion to be kind.
Tis nor thundring Phrase, nor Othes,
Honours, wealth, nor painted Clothes,
That can her good liking gaine,
If no other worth remaine.

Never tooke her heart, delight
In your Court-Hermaphrodite,
Or such frothy Gallants, as
For the Times Heroes passe.
Such; who (still in love) doe all
Faire, and Sweet, and Lady call.
And where e're they hap to stray,
Either prate the rest away;
Or of all discourse to seeke,
Shuffle in at Cent or Gleek.

Goodnesse more delights her, than
All their Maske of Folly can.
Fond, she hateth to appeare,
Though she hold her friend as deare,
As her part of life unspent:
Or the best of her content.

If the heat of youthfull fires,
Warme her blood with those desires,
Which are by the course of Nature,
Stird in every perfect Creature:
As those Passions kindle, so
Doth Heavens grace, and Reason grow
Abler, to suppresse in her
Those rebellions; and they stirre,
Never more affection, then
One good thought allayes agen.

I could say, so chast is shee,
As the new-blowne Roses be.
Or the drifts of Snow, that none
Ever toucht, or lookt upon.
But, that were not worth a Flie,
Seeing so much Chastitie,
Old Pigmalion Picture had.
Yea, those Eunuchs borne or made,
Ne're to know Desire, might say,
Shee deserv'd no more then they.
Whereas, whilst their worth proceeds
From such wants, as they must needs,
Be unmov'd (cause Nature fram'd
No affections to be tam'd)
Through her daintie Limbs, are spread,
Vigour, heat, and freely shed,
Life blood into every vaine;
Till they fill, and swell againe:
And no doubt they strive to force,
Way, in some forbidden Course.
Which, by Brace she still resists;
And so Courbs within their lists,
Those Desires:  that she is chaster
Then if she had none to master.

Malice, never lets she in:
Neither hates she ought, but sin.
Envy, if she could admit,
Ther's no means to nourish it:
For, her gentle heart is pleas'd,
When she knowes anothers eas'd.
And ther's none, who ever got
That perfection, she hath not.
So, that no cause is there, why
Shee should any one envy.

Mildly angry sheele appeare,
That the baser Rout may feare;
Through presumption to misdoe.
Yet, she often faines that to.
But let wrong be whatsoever,
She gives way to Choller, never.

If she e're of Vengeance thought
Twas nor life, nor blood was sought;
But (at most) some prayer to move,
Justice for abused Love:
Or, that Fate would pay againe,
Loves neglectors with disdaine.

If she ever crav'd of Fate,
To obtaine a higher State;
(Or ambitiously were given)
Sure, twas but to climbe to heaven.
Pride, is from her heart as farre,
As the Poles in distance are.
For, her worth, nor all this praise,
Can her humble spirit raise,
Lesse to prize me, then before;
Or her selfe, to value more.

Were she Vaine; she might alledge,
Twere her Sexes priviledge.
But, shee's such; as (doubtlesse) no man
Knowes lesse folly, in a woman.

To prevent a being Idle,
Sometime, with her curious Needle,
(Though it be her meanest glory)
Shee so limns an Antique Story,
As Minerva (would she take it)
Might her richest Sample make it.

Otherwhile, againe, she rather
Labors, with delight to gather
Knowledge from such learned Writs,
As are left by famous Wits.
Where, Shee chiefly seekes to know,
God; Hereselfe; and what we owe,
To our Neighbour:  since with these,
Come all needfull Knowledges.

Shee, with Adam, never will
Long to learne both Good and Ill;
But, her state well understood,
Rests her selfe, content with Good.

Avarice, abhorreth shee,
As the loathsom'st things that be:
Since she knowes it is an ill
That doth ripest vertue kill.
And, where ere it comes to rest,
(Though in some strict matron's brest)
Be she ne're so seeming just,
Ile no shewes of Goodnesse trust.
For, if you but gold can bring;
Such, are hir'd to any thing.

If you thinke she Jealous be;
You are wide:  for credit me,
Her strong'st Jealousies, nought are,
Other than an honest care,
Of her friends.  And most can tell,
Whoso wants that, loves not well.

Though some little feare she showes,
Tis no more than love allowes:
So the passion doe not move her,
Till she greeve, or wrong her lover.
Shee may thinke He may doe ill;
Though, shee'l not beleeve he will.
Nor, can such a harmlesse thought,
Blemish true affection ought:
Rather, whenas else it would,
Through security growe cold.
This her Passion, keeping measure,
Strengthens Love and sweetens Pleasure.

Crueltie, her soule detests;
For, within her Bosome rests,
Noblest pittiy; ushered by,
An unequall'd Courtesie.
And, is griev'd at good mens moane,
As the griefe were all her owne.

Just shee is; so just, that I
Know she would not wrong a Flye;
Or, oppresse the meanest thing,
To be Mistresse to a King.

If our Painters would include,
Temperance, and Fortitude,
In one Picture; She would fitt,
For the nonce to paterne it.
Patient, as the Lambe is she.
Harmlesse, as the Turtles be.
Yea, so largely stor'd, with all
Which we Mortals Goodnesse call;
That, if ever Virtue were,
Or may be, incarnate here;
This is she, whose praises, I
Offer to Eternitie.

Shee's no Image trimd about,
Faire within, and foule without:
But a gem that doth appear
Like the Diamond, every where,
Sparkling rayes of Beautie forth;
All of such unblemisht worth,
That, wert possible, your eye
Might her inmost thoughts espie,
And behold the dimmest part,
Of the lustre in her heart.
It would find that Center passe,
What the Superficies was.
And, that every angle there,
Like a Diamonds inside were.

For, although that Excellence
Passe the piercingst Eye of Sence;
By their operations we,
Guesse at things that hidden be.
So (beyond our common reach)
Wise men can by Reason teach,
What the influences beene,
Of a Planet, when unseene;
Or the Beautie of a Starre,
That doth shine above us farre.
So, by that wide-beaming Light,
Wherewith Titan Courts our sight,
By his clothing of the Earth;
By the woundrous, various Birth,
Of new Creatures yearely bred
Through his heat; and nourished:
And by many Virtues moe
(Which our senses reach unto)
We conclude; they are not all,
Which make faire that goodly Ball.

Though shee prize her honour more,
Then the far-fetcht precious store
Of the rich Molucchi, or
All the wealth was traffickt for,
Since our Vessels, passage knew
Unto Mexico, Peru:
Or those spacious Kingdomes which
Make the proud Iberians rich.
Tis not that uncertaine blast,
Keepes my Mistresse Good, or Chast.
Shee, that but for honours sake,
Doth of ill a Conscience make;
(More in feare what Rumour sayes,
Then in love to virtuous wayes)
Though she seem'd more civill than,
You have seene a Courtezan,
For an honour:  And cries Oh fie,
At each shew of vanitie.
Though she censure all that be,
Not so foolish coy as shee.
Though she with the Roman Dame
Kill her selfe, to purchase fame.
Shee would prostitute become,
To the meanest basest Groome;
If so closely they may doe it,
As the world should never know it.
So at best those women proove,
That for honour; virtue love.
Give me her, that Goodnes chooseth
For it owne sake:  and refuseth
To have greatest honours gain'd,
With her secret conscience stain'd.
Give me her, that would be poore,
Die disgrac't; nay, thought a whoore;
And each Times reproch become,
Till the generall day of Doome:
Rather then consent to act
Pleasing Sinne, though by the fact,
(With esteeme of virtuous) she
Might the German Empresse be.
Such my Mistresse is; and nought
Shall have power to change her thought.
Pleasures canot tempt her eye,
On their Bayts to glance awry.
For their good she still esteemes,
As it is; not as it seemes:
And, she takes no comfort in
Sweetest pleasure, sowr'd with Sinn.

By her selfe, she hath such care,
That her actions decent are.
For, were she in secret hid,
None might see her what she did.
Shee would doe, as if for spies,
Every wall were stucke with eyes.
And be chary of her honour,
Cause the heavens do looke upon her,
And, oh what had power to move,
Flames of Lust, or wanton love,
So farre, to disparage us,
If we all were minded thus:
These, are Beauties that shall last,
When the Crimson blood shall wast;
And the shining Haire wax gray:
Or with age be worne away.
These, yeeld pleasures, such as might,
Be remembered with delight;
When we gaspe our latest breath,
On the loathed bed of death.

Though discreetly speake shee can,
Sheele be silent, rather than
Talke while others may be heard.
As if she did hate, or fear'd,
Their Condition; who will force
All, to wait on their Discourse.
Reason hath on her bestowed
More of knowledge, then she owed
To that Sex:  and grace with it,
Doth aright her Practice fit.

Yet, hath Fate so framed her,
As she may at sometime, erre:
But, if ere her judgement stray,
Tis that other women may,
Those much pleasing Beauties see,
Which in yeelding Natures be.
For, since no perfection can
Here on earth be found in Man,
Ther's more good in free submissions,
Then ther's ill in our transgressions.
Should you heare her, once, contend,
In discoursing, to defend
(As she can) a doubtfull Cause:
She such strong Positions drawes
From known Truths; and doth apply,
Reasons with such Majestie:
As if she did undertake,
From some Oracle to speake.
And you could not think, what might
Breed more love, or more delight.

Yet, if you should marke agen,
Her discreet behaviour, when
She finds Reason to repent
Some wrong pleaded Argument.
She so temperately lets all
Her mis-held opinions fall;
And, can with such Mildnesse bow:
As 'twill more enamour you,
Then her knowledge.  For, there are
Pleasing sweets without compare
In such yeeldings; which doe proove,
Wit, Humilitie, and Love.
Yea, by those mistakings; you
Her Condition so shall know,
(And the nature of her mind,
So undoubtedly shall find)
As will make her, more endeared,
Then if she had never erred.

Farther; that she nought may misse,
Which worth praise in woman, is:
This, unto the rest I add.
If I wound, or sicknes, had;
None should for my curing runne.
(No not to Appollo's sonne)
She, so well, the Virtue knowes,
Of each needfull Hearbe that growes;
And so fitly, can apply,
Salves to every Maladie:
That, if she, no succour gave me,
Twere no meanes of Art, could save me.

Should my Soule oppressed lye,
(Sunke with griefe and sorrow nigh)
She hath balme for minds distrest;
And could ease my pained breast.
She so well knowes how to season,
Passionate discourse with Reason;
And knowes how to sweeten it,
Both with so much love and wit;
That, it shall prepare the Sense.
To give way with lesse offence.
For, greeved minds, can ill abide,
Counsell churlishly applid:
Which, instead of comfortings,
Desperation, often brings.

But harke Nymphs:  me thinkes, I heare
Musicke, sounding in mine eare.
Tis a Lute:  and hee's the best
For a Voice, in all the West,
That doth touch it.  And the Swaine,
I would have you heare so faine,
That my Song, forbeare will I,
To attend his melodie.

Hither comes he, day by day,
In these Groves to sing, and play.
And, in yon close Arbour, He
Sitteth now, expecting me.
He, so bashful is; that mute
Will his Tongue be, and his Lute,
Should he happen to espie
This, unlookt for Company.

If you, therefore list to heare him,
Let's with silence walke more neere him.
'Twill be worth your paines (beleeve me)
(If a Voice, content may give yee)
And, await you shall not long;
For, He now beginns a Song.

SONNET 1.
What is the cause, when elsewhere I resort,
I have my Gestures, and Discourse more free?
And (if I please) can any Beauty Court,
Yet stand so dull, and so demure by thee?
Why are my speeches broken whilst I talke?
Why doe I feare almost thy hand to touch?
Why dare I not imbrace thee as we walk,
Since, with the greatest Nymphs I've dared as much?
Ah!  know that none of those I e're affected;
And therefore, us'd a carelesse Courtship there:
Because, I neither their Disdaine respected,
Nor reckon'd them, or their embraces deare.
But, loving Thee; my love hath found content;
And rich delights, in things indifferent.

SONNET 2.
Why Covet I, thy blessed eyes to see;
Whose sweet aspect, may cheere the saddest mind?
Why, when our bodies must divided be,
Can I no howre of rest, or pleasure find?
Why doe I sleeping start, and waking mone,
To finde, that of my dreamed hopes I misse?
Why, doe I often contemplate alone,
Of such a thing as thy Perfection is?
And wherefore, when we meet, doth Passion stop
My speechles Tongue, and leave me in a panting?
Why, doth my heart o'rechargd with feare and hope
(In spite of Reason) almost droop to fainting?
Because, in Me thy excellences moving,
Have drawne me to an Excellence in loving.

SONNET 3.
Faire, since thy Virtues my affections move,
And I have vowd my purpose is to joyne,
(In an eternal Band of chastest Love)
Our soules, to make a Mariage most divine.
Why (thou may'st thinke) then, seemeth he to prize,
An outward Beauties fading hue so much?
Why, doth he read such Lectures in mine eyes?
And often strive my tender palme to touch?
Oh, pardon my presuming:  For I sweare,
My Love is soyled, with no lustfull spot:
Thy Soules perfections, through those vailes appeare,
And I halfe faint, that I embrace them not.
No foule Desires, doth make thy touches sweet:
But, my Soule striveth, with thy Soule to meet.

SONNET 4.
Shall I wasting in Dispaire,
Dye because a Womans faire?
Or make pale my cheekes with care,
Cause anothers Rosie are?
Be she fairer then the Day,
Or the flowry Meads in May;
If She be not so to me,
What care I how faire shee be.

Should my heart be grievd or pin'd,
Cause I see a Woman kind?
Or a well disposed Nature,
Joyned with a lovely Feature?
Be shee meeker, kinder, than
Turtle-Dove, or Pelican:
If shee be not so me
What care I, how kind she be.

Shall a Womans Virtues move,
Me, to perish for her love?
Or, her well-deserving knowne,
Make me quite forget mine own?
Be shee with that Goodnesse blest,
Which may gaine her, name of Best:
If she be not such to me,
What care I, how good she be.

Cause her Fortune seemes too high,
Shall I play the foole, and dye?
Those that beare a Noble minde,
Where they want of Riches find,
Thinke, what with them, they would doe,
That without them, dare to wooe.
And unlesse that mind I see,
What care I, though Great she be.

Great, or Good, or Kind, or Faire,
I will ne're the more dispaire,
If She love me, this beleeve;
I will die, er'e she shall grieve.
If she slight me, when I wooe;
I can scorne, and let her goe,
For, if shee be not for me,
What care I, for whom she be?

SONNET 5.
I wandred out, a while agone,
And went I know not whither:
But, there doe Beauties many a one,
Resort, and meet together.
And Cupids power will there be showne,
If ever you come thither.

For, like two Sunnes, two Beauties bright,
I shining saw together,
And, tempted by their double light,
My eyes I fixt on either:
Till both at once, so thral'd my sight,
I lov'd, and knew not whether.

Such equall sweet Venus gave,
That I prefer'd not either:
And when for love, I thought to crave,
I knew not well of whether.
For, one while, This, I wisht to have,
And then, I That, had liefer.

A Lover of the curioust Eye,
Might have been pleasd in either.
And so, I must confesse, might I,
Had they not been together.
Now, both must love, or both denie,
In one, enjoy I neither.

But yet at last I scapt the smart,
I feard, at comming hither.
For, seeing my divided heart,
I chusing, knew not whether.
Love angry grew, and did depart;
And now, I care for neither.
