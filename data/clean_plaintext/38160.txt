In a large Forest once there stood
A Tree, the Glory of the wood;
Call'd, by the neigh'bring Country Folk,
With one Consent, the Royal Oak.
Oraculous it was, the Fates
Of mighty Monarchies, and States,
If truly told, and their Debates
Of Right, or Wrong, did arbitrate;
And if right Reasons would not do't,
Found trusty Sticks to beat 'em to't.
Not the fam'd Argo, sent from Greece,
To Colchos for the Golden Fleece,
With richer Spoils return'd again,
Than Fleets, built of its Stock, from Spain.
Under its Shade the Druids sate
Of old; to guide, or ride the State:
But Craft, and Cant, by Time explor'd,
The Oak obey'd, a rightful Lord,
Who soon stripp'd off from Trunk and Bough
The Ivy, and the Misleto,
Those Suckers, cherisht by blind Zeal
To prey upon the Commonweal.
But as no State is perfect known,
Or permanent below the Sun;
The Tree hence various Changes found,
Now bark'd and lopt, now trimm'd and prun'd;
And by Good fortune, or Disaster,
Compell'd full oft' to change its Master.
And now, with each Grace endow'd,
Just, gen'rous, well-resolv'd, and good,
Anxious to do a Woodward's Part,
And keep it safe and sound at Heart:
But such a Wild about it grew,
'Twas more than mortal Man could do
To clear the Brakes and Brambles round,
That fill'd and tainted all the Ground,
The thriving Plants, and Saplings choak'd,
And strove to Lord it o'er the Oak,
And by their great Increase began
T' inflame their native Lebanon.

May the Reverse of Jotham's Tale
Fire from the Oak their Growth destroy;
And the Great Warden of the Pale,
Axes to clear their Roots imploy.
