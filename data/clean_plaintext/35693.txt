Pure child of nature, rest thee as thou art;
Friends they are not, who urge thee to forego
The timid glance which speaks th' unpractised heart,
Whose chasten'd fires with milder radiance glow.
Friends they are not, who scorn the modest ray
Which through the sable curtain of thine eye
Tremblingly beams! &mdash; Too fierce the glare of day,
When no light summer cloud corrects the sky!
The bold intrepid stare, the gaze assured,
Tells how, in every vice, the worldling is matured!

Friends they are not, who ridicule the blush
Quick mantling o'er that ever-varying cheek;
'Tis innocence!  whose soul-subduing flush
A language more than mortal seems to speak!
Looks not the lily loveliest, when the rose
Bends o'er her blossoms, lending foreign grace?
Thus, on the cheek of youth, the warm blush shews:
'Tis Virtue's Banner, waved o'er Beauty's Face!
O what, like sacred Innocence, can warm!
Should'st thou forget to blush, thou wouldst forget to charm.
