Young Peris of the North!  'tis bliss to be
Within the influence of these gladdening eyes!
More lovely than the lovliest stars to me,
And fair as is the light of Eastern skies&mdash;
When darkness leaves the world, and daybreak lies
Like cradled slumber on wide ocean's face!&mdash;
When morning hymns, address'd to Heaven, arise
With rising day, that now begins his race
On fair Aurora's steeds, all matchless in their pace.

Ye are the loveliest of the virgin train,
That lead the mazy dance, that tread the green;
Many's the heart those eyes of yours have slain,
Yet all unconscious of their power ye seem!
There's not a spot on earth where I have been,
Can boast of beauties that more purely shine!
Ev'n that famed Paradise of old, I ween,
Held naught, in shape of woman, more divine:
'Tis well for me, the world hath steel'd this breast of mine!

And loveliness like this, 'neath northern skies,
Such matchless grace, in forms so passing fair,&mdash;
Brings more delight into the wondering eyes
Than found in climes where the unchilling air
Ruffles not nature, nor her children there,
Freezes not life, that fills the living vein,
Nor presses on the brow that wears no care,
But makes more pure the blood that flows again
Back to the heart, as streams and rivers seek the main.

Thy imaged likeness in my soul I'll bear
Where lead my steps; and if, in after time,
The fame of sculptured groups should meet thine ear,
Whose pliant arms around each other twine,
Link'd in undying love!  this group divine
Will be the Fairy Sisters of my lay;
And should they cast one thought on me or mine,
'Twill tend to lengthen out my waning day,
And lend a brighter gleam to life's last struggling ray.
