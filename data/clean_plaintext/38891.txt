Assist my Lay, ye sacred Nine!
Aid me with ev'ry Thought divine,
To sing the Praise, and paint the Grace
That sparkles in the beauteous Face
Of dear VARIETY! &mdash; O pleasing Sound!
In this (and this alone) Delight is always found.

VARIETY!  I hail thy Name:
Without thee what is Wealth or Fame?&mdash;
Thy Charms, will Damon's Pain remove,
And cure the desp'rate Youth of Love:
From Death and Bondage they can set him free,
And give the Swain at once both Life and Liberty.

The greatest Pleasure Man enjoys,
If long continu'd, how it cloys!&mdash;
Behold, how fondly we pursue
Each gaudy Trifle that is new;
Whilst Things of real Worth neglected lie:
This plainly shews thy Force, O dear VARIETY!

How dull, insipid, wou'd appear
The Hours of each revolving Year,
Depriv'd of thy enliv'ning Aid!
Ev'n Sol's bright Rays wou'd seem to fade:
But kind indulgence Heav'n bestow'd on thee
Invigorating Lustre, &mdash; dear VARIETY!

No pen can paint, or Tongue express
Thy boundless Charms:  All, all confess
Thy Pow'r. &mdash; O then let Reason guide,
Ye headstrong Youths, and Vice deride;
Its Paths you've follow'd long; now vertuous be,
And thus you'll taste the Sweets of dear VARIETY.
