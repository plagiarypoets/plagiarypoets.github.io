Here lies, reduc'd to ashes and cinder,
No Sir Paul, but Sir Abraham Pindar.
It is not fierce Horatio Vere,
But Horatio Cowley buried here.

Nor is this Polydore Virgil's room,
But Cantabrigian Virgil's tomb.
The pleasant'st child e'er England bred
The bravest youth e're Cambridge fed
The dearest man e're wore a head.

Whilst that thy ballads up and down do flutter
And the town gallants of thy town muse mutter
Possesse this church, though thou couldst not the Savoy
And in her soft lap let Melpomene have thee.

Let no Court storm nor tough-lung'd zealot blow
Thy neatly angled atomes to and fro
And sleep in beggar's Limbo, by dull Chaucer,
Under the whim wham urn as broad as sawcer
Whilst that thy name doth smell as sweet as May's
And all the table talk is of thy Thais
Thy miscellany and thy Davideis.

Rot away here and let the vault endure thee
Let the religion of the house secure thee
And let the watching muses here immure thee.

Avaunt all ye that look profane and vile
Stand off, stand off, a hundred thousand mile
Nor with your thumbs this monument defile.

Let sugar-candy Cowley sleep in's grotte
Let not the people wake him, let them not
Nor steal away the surgeons gally pot.

Whilst on wing'd Pegasus thou [Phoebus Son]
Through air and earth and sea and all do ride
Whilst by Orinda's pipe thy praise is blown

Whilst thou dost soar aloft leave coyrs behind
To be interrd in antient monast'ry
And to the chimeing rabble safely joyn'd
