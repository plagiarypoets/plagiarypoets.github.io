At the door of my straw cover'd cot,
The rose and the jessamine blend;
Each tree that o'ershadows the spot
Is dear to my heart as a friend.
Its course from the first noble donor
From father to son, can we trace,
For ages the seat of fair honour,
Content, independence, and peace.

The lark, to enliven our toil,
High-mounting in extasy sings;
No med'cine our appetites spoil,
Health ever from industry springs.
Kind fortune permits to extend,
Tho' she give not a superfluous store,
A jug and a crust to a friend,
A morsel to gladden the poor.

The trav'ller at fast falling night
The smoke of my cottage surveys,
And journeys with bosom more light,
Secure of refreshment and ease.
In support and defence of the land
That yields such enjoyment to me,
Undaunted by menace I stand,
To preserve uncorrupted and free.
