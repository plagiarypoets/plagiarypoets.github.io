In the extremest East when Time began,
And God's own image walked sublime on earth,
In Eden's bower, where first the parent-man
Rose at the Eternal's voice, had Freedom birth.
Beneath serenest skies she led him forth,
Fearless and free and happy; &mdash; hand in hand
With innocence, and high in conscious worth.
Peace reigned within, and o'er the smiling land
Wantoned earth's first-born flocks in love's harmonious band.

The world was changed; a populous multitude,
Of diverse and discordant tongues, had grown
Re-multiplied on earth &mdash; till millions stood
Warring in nations, where their Sire alone
Had trod, the peaceful universe his own:
Guilt, like a pestilence, had o'er the race
A horrid taint of crime and discord thrown:
Freedom's forsook their haunts, and left no trace
Of her first love on earth &mdash; her youth's abiding place.

Then o'er the world a fearful darkness spread,
And men forgot their birth-right, and became
The trembling victims of a nameless dread&mdash;
Phantoms themselves had reared, but could not tame.
Panders of vice, and heritors of shame,
They fashioned to themselves a mortal God&mdash;
An earthly Moloch; and with loud acclaim
Bowed the submissive forehead to the sod,
Worshipped the out-stretched arm, and kissed the scourging rod.

Girding himself, the Monster gathered round
All evil ministers which Mischief hath;
Gaunt War dashed onward like an unleashed hound&mdash;
Ambition &mdash; burning to destroy and scathe&mdash;
And haggard Famine, prowling in his path:
Hot Murder came &mdash; and with distempered eye,
Leering Suspicion, Fear, and gory Wrath,
Shouting with fiendish glee destruction's cry,
And warring 'gainst the world, for giant Tyranny.

Three portions of the earth the might confessed
Of the destroyer &mdash; yet one spot remained
Far in the wilds of the extremest west
His sceptre could not reach, yet unprofaned.
Here created every hope which earth contained&mdash;
Yet thirsting still for Empire, he arrayed
Legions of fiends, his dogs of war unchained,
While men looked on the mighty strife dismayed,
And called upon high heaven, the world's last hope, to aid.

Uprose the cry &mdash; and morn, and noon, and even,
Ceased not to rise beleaguered Freedom's prayer
Re-echoing from a million hearts to heaven,
Wafting the wail of Nations, Earth's despair&mdash;
Till woke to wrath, avenging spirits there
Roused at the cry of suffering myriads, came:
Justice with her redeeming right arm bare&mdash;
Wisdom to light the way with torch of flame&mdash;
And Vengeance mailed for war, the invader's pride to tame.

On swiftest pinions rushing &mdash; hand in hand
The avenging sisters came &mdash; until they stood
On Vernon's height, and viewed the threatened land;
O'er the far plains, a silent multitude,
Hopeless of triumph, but yet unsubdued,
Were waiting fearlessly the coming shock;&mdash;
Each looked on his doomed neighbor, and renewed
The stern resolve &mdash; and braced as 'gainst a rock,
Drew close his fellow's grasp, the kindred ranks to lock.

Invisible they saw; and from the height
Of Vernon's sacred hill, commissioned forth,
Clothed with fit majesty, resistless might,
All signs and tokens of excelling worth&mdash;
The great Apostle of their cause on earth,
The untamed Eagle of the western sky,
Came from the mountain regions of his birth,
Waving his glad wings with exulting cry,
To lead the appointed chief to glorious victory.

Thus armed and panoplied and led, he went
Forth where the self-devoted heroes stood;
Right on their foes his wrathful course was bent,
In his right hand the sword of Justice glowed,
And Wisdom blazed before him as he trode,
And Vengeance, to unwonted sternness steeled,
Strode tearless amid fields of waste and blood&mdash;
Through the vast continent his war-cry pealed,
Calling on all to arm, and follow to the field.

The strife was joined with desperate malice &mdash; on&mdash;
On drove the foes &mdash; secure of easy prey&mdash;
Flushed with the mighty triumphs they had won
In other worlds; and portioning out to slay
The few thin troops, that barred their wide array;
On drove the foes with insult and with mock
Careering in their pride &mdash; till in midway
Dashed on the band, like waves upon the rock,
Broken they back recoiled, astounded at the shock.

Again they rallied &mdash; on &mdash; still on &mdash; the cry;
While through the routed legions, fiercely ran
Yells for revenge with vows for victory:
Wrath, grief, contempt and shame were there to fan
The flame to fury &mdash; close then man to man
With firm ranks serried &mdash; sullenly they came;
In vain &mdash; for blazing on the opposing van
The Appointed rode &mdash; and from his path of flame
Scattered and trampled down &mdash; they fled in deeper shame.
