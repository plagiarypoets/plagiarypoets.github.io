Hither, all ye Loves and Graces,
Hither with your smiling faces;
Frolic Mirth with aspect wild,
(Sweet Good-humour's lovely child)
Come and make the scene more gay,
Welcome in the sprightly May.

Hence, ah!  Melancholy hence,
Nor thy baleful gloom dispense;
But hither haste ye jocund train,
Assemble on the verdant plain;
Come and chaunt a rural lay,
Welcome to the sprightly May.

Thalia come, thou laughing muse,
And thy gaiety diffuse;
Come, and with thy comic face,
Fill with pleasure every place;
Leave Parnassus for this day,
Welcome in the sprightly May.

Nymphs and swains, ye merry throng,
Charm the ear with rustic song;
Let music echo thro' the grove,
Softest notes of peace and love,
While the warblers on each spray,
Join the welcome to the May.
