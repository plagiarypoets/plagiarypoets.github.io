The morning lowr'd; yet azure skies succeed;
Mantled with volumes of suspending gold,
Known in these rich, cerulean isles alone.
Come!  let us fill our wallets:  then with line,
Arm'd with two hooks, and bearing on our backs
The rod and basket, to the neighbouring stream
We'll saunter; listen to the bubbling noise,
That tells how fleet the winding waters are:
And then, descending from the meadow's side,
We'll creep beneath yon arching boughs, that shade
The babbling stream; where, fishing for a while,
Soon we will lose all memory of our line
In the sweet page of Walton, or the spells
Of frantic Comus, and the Faerie Queene....
