THYRSIS.
Dear Corydon, whence flow your tears,
Whence this sighing, this groaning, and grief?
Be happy!  Away with your fears,
Next Mail may perhaps bring relief,
The Dutchmen's affairs will come round&mdash;

CORYDON.
D&mdash;n the Dutchmen, wherever they be;
I would rather they all had been drown'd
Than this curse should have fallen upon me.

I yesterday rose with the day,
I yesterday scour'd my gun,
And to Islington fields bent my way,
Where I travers'd about 'till past One.

Then weary, fatigued, and what not,
I was thinking to make a retreat,
When a partridge some one must have shot,
Fell fluttering down at my feet.

Though his wing had a terrible wound,
I fear'd he again might have fled,
So I took the butt end of my piece,
And with three blows knock'd him on the head.

That done, he was popp'd in the poke
With three sparrows I knock'd down before,
And to every man that I spoke,
That I kill'd him right truly I swore.

I gave it to Molly the Cook,
For my whet 'fore I went to the Ship,
And curse her, aye curse her black look,
She has roasted it dry as a chip.

The crumbs are with cinders quite spoil'd,
The bread sauce is black as my hat,
The gravy and butter are oil'd,&mdash;
Oh!  curse and confound her for that.

But why should I sigh and complain,
I must bear it as well as I can;
To lament or to sigh is in vain,
Misfortune's the portion of Man!

At the Ship I a dinner shall find,
That I hope will make up for my loss;
So walk with me, for you have not din'd,
And I'll promise no more to be cross.

THYRSIS.
Why, then, keep your word, my dear swain,
And cheer up that dismal long face,
To do away sorrow and pain,
See here I have brought you a brace!

CORYDON.
Oh, ye Gods, what delectable birds!
My heart is rejoic'd at the sight&mdash;
To express what I feel I want words,
So, by Jove, we will have these drest right.
