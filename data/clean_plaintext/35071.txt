Marriage!  forbear, thou rash ungarded youth!
Attend the friendly precepts of the muse:
She dares unfold the harsh unwelcome truth,
To curb thy fires, and check thy ardent views;
Dissolves the magic charm that lures thine eye,
Where pangs and sharp remorse in treach'rous ambush lie.

Of mystic rapture, tho' thy favour'd eye
Have drunk deep draughts at many a transient view;
These visionary charms too soon will die,
No longer pleasing, when no longer new.
O!  vain to hope these fleeting joys shall last,
When novel days, and weeks, and honey-moon are past!

And tho' with skill she drive the pointed steel,
And many a selvedge runs with busy speed:
Can selvedges divert the pangs you feel,
When clouded comes the dismal hour of need?
When dear earn'd shillings fly ten thousand ways,
In shape of caps, and cloaks, and stockings, shoes, and stays?

And if in song she charm thy ravish'd ear,
And trip it graceful in the mazy dance;
What strain, what step, may sooth thy fate severe,
When dreary winter's shiv'ring months advance?
Joyous no more to share in flowing bowls,
Now doom'd to curse the cost of candles, and of coals!

How beats thine heart, when fashion's changeful laws
Enjoin new modes, and each frail female shines,
With tow'ring head-dress rich in flowing gauze?&mdash;
To join the giddy throng thy partner pines;
With eager zeal to shew an early taste,
In Folly's num'rous train she grieves to list the last.

When Summer-sabbath crowns the lagging week,
And ruddy Phoebus gilds the landscape round,
Then spruce acquaintance shall thy table seek,
And gossip neighbours at thy board be found:
Succeeds a lengthful train, unknown before,
Aunts, cousins, sisters, nieces, drain thy conjugal store.

But O!  what pen may paint the pure delight,
When wealth, when virtue, lasting bliss insures;
When youthful beauty waits the hallow'd rite,
And parent's willing voice the boon secures.
Not here the muse pours forth her sorrowing song,
To this auspicious theme her gayest notes belong!
