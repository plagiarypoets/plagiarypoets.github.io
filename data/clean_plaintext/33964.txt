Phyllis, she is both blyth and yonge,
Of Phyllis is my Sylver Songe:
I love thilke Lass, tho' in my Heart,
She breeds full many a baleful Smart.
Kids, Cracknells, with my earliest Fruit,
I give to make her hear my Suit.
When Colin does approach o'erjoy'd
My Hopes alas!  are all accoy'd.
Were I not born to love the Maid,
Yet she calls Miracles to her Aid.
When stormy Show'rs had dress'd the Year,
In shiv'ring Winter's wrathful Chear,
Phyllis that lovely cruel Wight,
Found me all in a drearie Plight:
And Snow-Balls gentlie flung at me,
To wake me from my Lethargye.
But Fire I ween there was ypent,
In all those frozen-Balls she sent,
For, ah!  woe's me, I felt them burn,
And all my Soul to Flames did turn.
Ah!  Phyllis, if you'd quench my Fire,
Burn your self with as fierce Desire.
