See, where she comes!  transcending human praise;
With downcast eyes, that ever love the ground.
Not with more crimson hue
Looks the pure virgin rose,
Than does the blush, that vivifies her cheek,
(The glowing emblem of her spotless mind:)
The tint, that Nature gives
To innocence alone.
Far other colour stains the face of Guilt:
Far other flushes her confusion mark,
Than Modesty receives
From Truth's immortal touch.
The zone of Chastity entwines her waist,
And Virtue's shade fits close around her neck,
As loving to be near
Perfections so divine.
Look up, sweet maid!  and with one awful glance
Yon' public harlot, Impudence, confound,
That would confront thy step,
And blast the charms she wants.
Look up! &mdash; and thou shalt see the convert bend
Beneath the sun beam of thy sacred eye,
And weep to touch the hem
Of thy celestial stole.
