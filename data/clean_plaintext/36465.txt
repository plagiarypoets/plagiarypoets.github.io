Glory and boast of Avalon's fair vale,
How beautiful thy ancient turrets rose!
Fancy yet seems them, in the sunshine pale
Gleaming, or more majestic in repose,&mdash;
When west-away, the crimson landscape glows,&mdash;
Casting their shadows on the waters wide,
How sweet the sounds, that, at still day-light's close
Came blended with the airs of eventide,
When thro' the glimmering aisle faint "misereres" died!

But all is silent now! &mdash; silent the bells,
That, heard from yonder ivy turret high,
Warn'd the cowl'd brother from his midnight cell;&mdash;
Silent the vesper-chaunt &mdash; the Litany
Responsive to the organ! &mdash; scatter'd lie
The wrecks of the proud Pile 'mid arches grey,&mdash;
Whilst hollow winds through mantling ivy sigh,
And e'en the mould'ring shrine is rent away,
Where, in his warrior weeds, the British Arthur lay.

Now look upon the sister Fane of Wells!
It lifts its forehead in the lucid air,&mdash;
Sweet o'er the champaign sound its Sabbath bells,&mdash;
Its roof rolls back the chaunt, or voice of prayer,
Anxious we ask, "Will heav'n that temple spare?
Or mortal tempest sweep it from its state?
Oh!  say, shall Time revere that fabric fair,
Or shall it meet, in distant years, thy fate,
Shatter'd, Proud Pile, like thee, and left as desolate?

NO!  to subdue or elevate the soul,
Our best, our purest, feelings to refine,
Still, shall the solemn Diapasons roll
Through the high Fane!  still hues reflected shine,
From the tall windows, on the sculptur'd shrine,
Tinging the pavement!  for He shall afford&mdash;
He who directs the storm &mdash; his aid divine,
Because its Sion has not left thy word,
Nor sought for other guide than Thee, Almighty Lord!
