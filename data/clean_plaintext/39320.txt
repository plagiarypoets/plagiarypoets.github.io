The ev'ning how calm it appears,
How tranquil!  how pleasant!  and cool;
From labour returning the steers,
Refresh at the green-crested pool.
Come, Celadon, pomp lay aside,
To grandeur no longer attend;
Thou foe to unciviliz'd pride,
To me thou unvarying friend.

The shepherds sing carols of love,
The ploughmen are blithe on their way;
The turtles soft coo in the grove,
The green is all jocund and gay;
With music re-echoes the glade,
The valley with harmony rings;
The tabor and pipe in the shade
Make the rustics as happy as kings:

In friendship together we'll walk,
And mark the decline of the day,
With chearfulness wander and talk,
Till Phoebus withdraw his last ray.
Then to my lov'd cottage repair,
And share the convivial glass;
What pleasure to hear you declare
The charms of your favourite lass.
