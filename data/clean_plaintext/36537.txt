She was a thing of morn &mdash; with the soft calm
Of Summer evening in her pensive air;
Her smile came o'er the gazer's heart like balm,
To soothe away all sorrow save despair;
Her radiant brow scarce wore a trace of care,&mdash;
A sunny lake, where imaged you might trace,
Of Hope and Memory all that's bright and fair,
Where no rude breath of Passion came to chase,
Like winds from Summer wave, its heaven from that sweet face.

As one who looks on landscapes beautiful
Will feel their spirit all his soul pervade;
E'en as the heart grows stiller by the lull
Of falling waters, when the winds are laid;
So he who gaz'd upon this heavenly maid
Imbibed a sweetness never felt before:
Oh!  when with her through Autumn fields I've stray'd,
A brighter hue the ling'ring wild-flowers wore,
And sweeter was the song the small bird warbled o'er!

Then came Consumption, with her languid moods,
Her soothing whispers, and her dreams that seek
To nurse themselves in silent solitudes;
She came, with hectic glow and wasted cheek,
And still the maiden pined, more wan and weak,
'Till her declining loveliness each day
Paled like the second bow; yet would she speak
The words of hope, e'en while she past away
Amidst the closing clouds, and faded ray by ray!

She died i' the bud of being, in the spring&mdash;
The time of flow'rs, and songs, and balmy air;
'Mid opening blossoms she was with'ring,
But thus 'twas ever with the good and fair,
The lov'd of Heaven:  ere yet the hand of Care
Upon the snowy brow hath set his seal,
Or Time's hoar frost come down to blanch the hair,
They fade away, and 'scape what others feel,
The pangs that pass not by &mdash; the wounds that never heal!

They laid her in the robes that wrap the dead;
So beautiful in rest ye scarce might deem,
From form so fair, the gentle spirit fled,
But only lapp'd in some Elysian dream;
And still the glory of a vanish'd dream;
The ling'ring halo of a parted ray,
Shed o'er her lonely sleep its latest gleam,
Like evening's rose-light, when the Summer day
Hath fled o'er sea and shore, and faded far away.
