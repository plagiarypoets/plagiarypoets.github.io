Minstrel of morn, whose wild mellifluous strains,
As blithe Aurora paints the opening day,
Now sweetly echo o'er the rural plains,
Ere yet bright Phoebus lifts his golden ray,
Ere yet each songster from the leafy spray,
Pours his "wild carol" on the rustic's ear,
Thou hailest Nature with thy grateful lay,
As fleet thy pinions cleave the azure air.
To me, whose bosom love hath fill'd with care,
Now as along I shape my pensive way,
Wrapp'd in deep thoughts of her deluding fair,
Whose treach'rous wiles first led my heart astray:
Thy notes, sweet warbler, ease my bosom's throes,
And give awhile kind respite to my woes.
