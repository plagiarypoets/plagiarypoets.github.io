As the forsaken Blouzelinda stood
High on the bank of crystal Isis flood,
(For witless Colin Clout, her perjur'd swain,
Had sought the town and left his native plain)
Thus to the purling waves she told her tale:
(Her voice re-echo'd thro' the distant vale)

"Is this your faith, O perjur'd lout, to leave
Your Blouzelinda all alone to grieve:
Can you, O Colin Clout, without regret,
Leave Blouzelinda for a vain coquet!
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day,
When first to Oxon's walls he bent his way.

"To you, ye woods and streams, my pray'r's preferr'd,
For you his vows now violated heard;
Are there no mighty pow'rs in heav'n above,
Plac'd and ordain'd to punish slighted love?
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day,
When first to Oxon's walls he bent his way.

"No tree is there in yon sequester'd grove,
But what was conscious of our mutual love;
No tree of any size but bears my name,
Carv'd by his hand, a witness of his flame.
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day,
When first to Oxon's walls he bent his way.

"That oak, which o'er these streams its head reclines,
Bears on its trunk these loving, artless lines,
When luckless Colin shall forget his love,
Back to its fountain head let Isis rove,
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day,
When first to Oxon's walls he bent his way.

"Roll back, ye streams, ye waters backward flow,
The faithless Colin has forget his vow;
Ye purling streams thou Isis backward rove,
The faithless Colin has forgot his love.
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day,
When first to Oxon's walls he bent his way.

"Is this the love which once you did declare,
When you fine garters brought me from the fair?
The gaudy ribband to adorn my head,
The bugle necklace, and gilt gingerbread.
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day,
When first to Oxon's walls he bent his way.

"Nor is my person of the ugliest hue,
If these fair streams, my looking-glass, tell true.
To all I turn my hand, I brew, I bake,
Or lead the chearful dance at sportive wake.
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day,
When first to Oxon's walls he bent his way.

"But come, O Colin come, for without thee
What is the wake, or what the dance to me?
Come, Colin Clout, O come, no longer stay,
Or in these streams I drown my care away.
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day,
When first to Oxon's walls he bent his way.

"Aid, O my tender lambkins, aid my groan,
Aid me, my flock with bleating cry, to moan:
Aid me, ye hollow, noisy winds to sigh,
Aid me with tears, ye purling streams, to cry.
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day,
When first to Oxon's walls he bent his way.

"Aid me, my arm, to finish all my care,
Aid me, my woes, and heighten my despair
Aid me, my sorrows, and my mis'ries aid,
And you, ye streams, receive a wretched maid.
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day,
When first to Oxon's walls he bent his way.

"Adieu, ye rural plains, thou beauteous mead,
Where crown'd with flow'ry garlands, erst I've play'd:
Adieu, ye streams, which gently flow along,
Ye banks, where oft I've tun'd my artless song.
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day,
When first to Oxon's walls he bent his way.

"Farewel, ye native rural plains, and you
Ye meadows, sprinkled with the pearly dew;
Far, far away your Blouzelinda flies,
She droops, she faints, she falls, she drops, she dies.
Sad was the hour and luckless was the day,
When first to Oxon's walls he bent his way."

She said, and forward stept, resolv'd to drown,
But careless of her path, she slipp'd, fell down;
When falling she beheld her long lost swain,
With look relenting, gliding o'er the plain.
Arising quickly up, she blest the day,
When first from Oxon's walls he bent his way.
