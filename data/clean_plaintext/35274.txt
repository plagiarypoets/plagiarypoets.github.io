Hail!  Friendship hail, thou source divine,
Whence copious streams of pleasure flow,
Inspiring every heart benign
With all thy honest warmth to glow;
Not vain thy power; for where extends thy sway,
Unsullied honour o'er the heart presides;
Vice from thy presence shrinks abash'd away,
And white-rob'd Virtue all thy actions guides;
Her beaming sceptre casts thy holy spell;
And in the circle all the moral graces dwell.

Oh!  blest irradiation mild,
To cheer us on our weary way,
Whether through gloomy desarts wild,
Or vales which fancy paints we stray;
For where each brilliant pointed beam extends,
The effects of vice no more disturb the mind
Illumined; but she cheerly onward bends,
With rapture, permanent, as great, to find
At thy pure crystal fount, without controul,
"The feast of reason, and the flow of soul."

Scowling indignant round the scene,
Her devious tracks full fraught with woe,
Misfortune moves with pallid mien,
Around, her venom'd shafts to throw;
And where she moves will friendship eager press,
With pity's tear soft-trembling in her eye,
To sooth the rustling gales of grief, and bless
The darkening gloom with rays of constancy;
Kindly the lengthened roll of ills to share;
At last, to steal the sting from heart-corroding care.

So when the tempest-driven car
Old Winter mounts, with rapid pace
Around to spread destructive war
O'er nature's animated space;
Haply soft peering midst some snow-fringed vale,
An ever-green may charm the wanderer's eye,
That braves the fury of the passing gale,
Till on its bloom the summer's breath shall sigh;
Waving its green leaves in the sun-shine hour,
That withered not, assailed by winter's ruthless power.
