Build'st thou on Wealth? &mdash; its wings are ever spread,
Its trusting votaries to elude and foil;&mdash;
On Science? &mdash; see!  his favourite sons have fled,
Like the pale lamp that lit their midnight toil,
Forgotten as the flower that deck'd the vernal soil.

Build'st thou on Love? &mdash; the simple heart it cheers,
When high in health, and all around is gay,
Yet leads to folly, vanity, and tears;&mdash;
Build'st thou on Fame? &mdash; the dancing meteor's ray
Glides not more swift, more unperceived away.

Ah!  why on sands like these thy temple rear?
How shall its base the storms and billows shun!
Seek the Eternal Rock with humble fear,
And on the tablet of each setting sun
Grave with a diamond's point, some deed of duty done.

If thou art young &mdash; the words of wisdom weigh,
Mature &mdash; the gathering ills of life beware,
Aged &mdash; Oh, make This mighty arm thy stay,
Who saves the weakest suppliant from despair,
And bids the darken'd tomb a robe of glory wear.
