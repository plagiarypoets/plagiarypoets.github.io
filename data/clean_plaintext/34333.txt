Young Hobbinol (the blithest swain)
Long time a dupe to haughty Molly;
With oaten reed and rustick strain,
Now pipes and sings the praise of Dolly,
O my Dolly, smiling Dolly,
My sweetly blooming, dearest Dolly,
Ye woods, ye lawns,
Ye flocks, ye fawns,
Assist me in the praise of Dolly.

The dimpl'd cheek, the sooty eye,
And ruby lip belong to Molly;
But virtue and simplicity,
Along bedeck my lovely Dolly.
O my Dolly, &c.

As late I rov'd (my heards astray)
I spy'd my love most melancholy;
And over-heard the fair one say,
Lo!  there's the man that's made for Dolly.
O my Dolly, &c.

We quickly met and down we sate,
Then told our loves beneath yon holly;
But should I half our joys relate,
You'd surely envy me and Dolly.
O my Dolly, &c.
