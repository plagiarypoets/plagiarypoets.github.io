When he, the exil'd Eagle-Emperor died,
Throneless and crownless in his rocky isle,
Encircled by the ever-tossing isle,
Whose waters lave that melancholy pile,
Oh!  who but mourned his destiny the while?
Or when Greece wept o'er BYRON'S early tomb,
How many a youthful brow its wonted smile
Awhile forebore, to share the general gloom;
To mourn the wayward CHILDE'S untimely tomb.

There is a deathless principle enshrined
In every heart, which prompts, howe'er we roam,
The wish, with natural feelings intertwined,
Still to return, and die in peace at home:
Though poor the fate, and humble be the dome
Which there awaits us, &mdash; to that cherished spot
Remembrance turns; &mdash; 'mid ocean's billowy foam
The Exile's home-born joys are unforgot,
Such joys once more to taste he prays may be his lot.
