It was a lovely Sabbath morn &mdash; the sun
Shone on the village spire with gladsome ray,
The toils and labours of the week now done,
The rest and stillness of this sacred day
Are hail'd by all with joy; all end their way,
Clad in their best attire, towards that door,
Which, opening wide, invites to praise and pray;
They enter, and the sound of footsteps heard no more
A placid stillness reigns the congregation o'er.

All eyes are bent towards the desk where stands,
His hair bleach'd by the frosts of four-score years,
A venerable old man &mdash; his aged hands
Are rais'd to Heaven in fervent prayer &mdash; the tears
Bedew his wither'd cheeks for those so dear
Who ne'er again will there behold his face;
He feels and is assur'd that death is near,
That the grim tyrant steals with slow unerring pace,
And soon shall he be clasp'd in his stern, chill embrace.

Why are the eyes of all with one accord
Bent on that face, wherefore does the deep sigh
Convulse each breast?  Because the voice of God
Has summon'd one so much belov'd, the hour is nigh
When that dear voice so often rais'd on high
In supplication, shall be heard no more
Within these walls; and e'en that placid eye,
That shone so bright and clear in days of yore,
Touch'd by death's damp, cold hand, will beam on earth no more.

As he walks forth, the sacred labours o'er,
His tottering steps upheld by childhood's arm,
The youth crowd round him to behold once more
Him who protected them from sin and harm,
And he is forc'd to stay his steps awhile
To bless those infants, who, with eager haste,
Press to behold that face, to share that smile,
The sweet reward of all their little troubles past,
Which no one but the good is e'er allow'd to taste.

Thrice happy man!  thy race so nearly run,
The glorious prize is full display'd to sight,
The labours of this toilsome life now done,
Soon in the realms of everlasting light,
Thoul't share the bliss of those who with their might,
Have kept their lips from guile, their hearts from sin;
And, mayhap, with unspeakable delight,
Thou'lt watch the steps of thy loved people still,
Guide them to every good, and shield from every ill.
