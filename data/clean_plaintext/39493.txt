To London town my steps I bent,
Where Truth must wear a front of brass,
To Westminster in haste I went,
For I'd a suit to urge, alas!
Then to my counsel learn'd I hied,
"Wise sir, I have a suit," I cried;
"Help me in forma pauperis to plead,"
But ah!  for want of cash I found I could not speed.

Among the crowd as I was press'd,
Whip from my head my hat was gone;
In the King's Bench, above the rest,
I saw a grave and portly Don:
Sure he I thought, won't take a fee,
So down I popp'd upon my knee;
"O to my suit great magistrate give a heed!"
Alas!  for want of cash, I found I could not speed.

I saw the clerks set all arow,
Writing as fast as fast might be;
The crier, too, began to crow,
He call'd aloud, ('twas strange to me,)
"O yes!  O yes!  O yes!" he whines,
"List to your names and save your fines!"
I cannot tell what they might save indeed;
And here, for want of cash, I knew I could not speed.

And now the Common Pleas I found,
Where one in silken coif look'd big;
I bow'd me to the very ground,
To his black cap and pompous wig:
I told him all my piteous case,
My neighbour's fraud, my own disgrace;
The devil a word did from his lips proceed!
He found I had no cash, and therefore could not speed.

Then to the Rolls away I went,
'Midst learned clerks in Chancery;
I found them all on gain intent,
The deuce a one regarded me.
Down on my marrow-bones I fell,
And 'gan my hapless tale to tell;
"Hold &mdash; first, good friend," they cry'd, "we must be fee'd!"
So here, for want of cash, I found I could not speed.
