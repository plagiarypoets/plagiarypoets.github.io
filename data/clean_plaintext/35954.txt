Wake, Harp of mine!  some lofty ditty ring,
Such as shall charm the sullen ear of Time,
And ere yon rolling planets cease to sing,
May mingle with their melodies sublime,
Lasting as they, and lovely as their chime.
Hope promised me a lay whose notes should sweep
Thro' the wide world, echoing in many a clime
When he who woke them lies in slumber deep,
A dark and moonless night, a long unstartled sleep.

And tho' that hope be vain &mdash; vain as the ray
That gleamed and glared and dazzled, and was o'er,
Yet thou mayest wile his life's dull dream away,
Charm many a weary hour, the rugged shore
Of earthly passage smoothe; and when no more
His hand can guide thee, or his spirit brave
Death's frenzied grasp, but desolate and hoar,
The spirits of the blast around thee rave,
Whisper one sorrowful note melodious o'er his grave.
