Colin, a Raw, but Heady Swain,
That tended Sheep upon the Plain,
Scarce knew the Terms of Hoi-Go-Ho,
Or when the Team should Stop or Go,
What Season's proper for to Plough,
What Ground to Fallow, what to Sow,
Or how to Cheapen, Sell, or Buy,
Or any Parts of Husbandry;
Being once hir'd to Widow Scot,
Who own'd much Land, and Farm'd to boot,
Grew vain, and fancy'd he could do
A Thousand Things he never knew:
The stupid Louts amaz'd to see
Colin advanc'd to such Degree,
Cry'd out, Sure he is something more
Than Country Volk do take him for.
The cunning Yeomen smoak'd the Bite,
And sneer'd the Widow's Want of Wit,
And o'er a Cup of Nappy Ale
Would crack a Jest and merry Tale
Of Colin's Blunders and his Cheats,
With many other pretty Feats;
How carelessly he us'd to keep
His private Stock, and Parish Sheep,
But rather than his private Stock
Should want, he'd borrow from the Flock:
Besides, how Colin once had been
Thought Tardy, but set right again,
It being his good Luck to keep
A Dog that strongly smelt of Sheep,
And when the Uproar first was heard,
Poor Mouse was hang'd, and Colin clear'd.
No sooner Colin settled was,
But threw th' Old Servants out of Place;
Old Cid, the Hind, was first discharg'd,
Who had the Rents and Fines enlarg'd;
Colin went briskly on below,
The Widow seldom car'd to know
Whate'er was done, so Gip and She
Might have their Syrup and their Tea:
This Gip, an ugly dowdy Jade,
Whom Widow Scot familiar made,
And had prefer'd from Milking-Pail
To Dress her Head, and Pin her Tail,
Had stol'n away the Widow's Heart,
That they could never be apart:
This Gip and Colin had combin'd
To keep the Widow warm, and blind:
The House thus modell'd, all Things went
Swimming, and to their Heart's Content,
And all was Colin's Management.
Such great Concerns in Colin's Hand,
Still often put him to the Stand;
He'd fain have kept some Servants in,
T' have learned by them to Manage fine,
They swore he trick'd, and would not joyn:
So he was forc'd to ask Advice
Of those he thought not very Wise.
The Farm, in Time, grew course and wild,
The Fences broke, made but one Field;
The Cattle dy'd for Want of Care;
And ev'ry Thing out of Repair:
The Stock, both Quick and Dead, was sold,
And Colin still kept all the Gold;
He took up Sums at Twelve per Cent,
When all before at Five had lent;
But yet he, uncontroul'd, went on,
And, with Success, being harden'd grown,
At Harvest turns off Carter John,
And puts in James, a Parish Boy,
A good Condition'd Youth, but Raw;
James Driving of an heavy Load,
Thro' a strait Lane, and miry Road,
Not knowing when to use his Whip,
The Horses stand, then frisk and leap,
And over-set the Load of Wheat,
That James was bruis'd in his Retreat:
The Village hooted when they found
The Wheat so spoil'd, the Carter shunn'd;
They forthwith to the Widow went
With, This is Colin's Management:
The Widow, frighted at the Cry,
Begg'd they'd some present Help apply,
And bid them haste for Carter John,
The Man she must rely upon.
Colin, with all his Scoundrel Crew,
The Rabble's Rage and Village flew.
