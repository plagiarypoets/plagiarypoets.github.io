The happy Bridegroom, whom Good Fortune courts
With all her tempting Charms, transported hails
Th' enchanting Moments as they glide along,
Full-fraught with Bliss distilling gently down,
And gladd'ning ev'ry Heart:  he speaks, and hark!
The voice of Joy resounds, Musick awakes
At his command, and captivating strains,
In various change, succeed, ev'n 'till the Soul
Grows sick of Pleasure:  see!  the sparkling Bride,
Adorn'd with all the elegance of Dress,
Appears, and into sudden Passion charms
The gazing Guest; her conscious Eyes betray
The pleasure of her Heart, and ev'ry glance
Is soften'd into Love:  like Graces round
The Cyprian Queen, a croud of lovely Nymphs
Attend, and, with incessant smiles, approve
The gladsome Hour; the flowing Bowl goes round,
By Laughter follow'd, and enliv'ning Mirth;
While frolick Dance, with unperceiv'd decay,
Wears out the Darkness, and approaching Morn
Seems, with untimely rays, to gild the World.

How diff'rent from the perplexing Scenes
That sadden'd Zeuma's matrimonial Rite,
And damp'd the bridal Day?  The loud acclaim
Of shouting nations, when the nuptial Vow
Was witness'd to the Skies, prov'd but a start,
A sudden transport of imperfect Joy,
That dy'd upon the Ear as soon as born:
No costly robes, or starry gems adorn'd
The pensive Fair; no diadem of gold,
Or glowing purple grac'd the thoughtful King;
No courtly Train attended to divert
The tedious Day, no artful Musick led
The lingring Night along; no flowing bowl
Provok'd to frantick Mirth, nor frolick dance
Made gay the spousal Eve:  but all was hush'd,
And silent as the hour of Death, or when
The mid-night Priest, in dark and lonely Vaults,
Repeats the fun'ral Dirge; ev'n Vesper hid
His lustrous orb in gloomy clouds, and, o'er
The shaded World, unusual Darkness hung;
Perch'd on the self-slain Lover's tomb,
The solitary Owl, with hideous note,
Scream'd out the marriage song, and roaming round
The regal Pile, the Daemon, that attends
Ill-fated Weddings, terrify'd the Gloom
With frequent Wailings, and inspir'd the Wretch,
Who trembling heard the sound with Phrenzy.  Day
Arose, with sullen, wat'ry clouds obscur'd;
A misty Rain, descending slow, bedew'd
The dreary Landscape, with continual Tears;
Each scented Herb, each op'ning Flow'r declin'd
It's drooping Head, and languish'd on the Green;
The nodding Forests, murm'ring to the Gale,
Sigh'd plaintive of Distress; the Mountain's brow,
Involv'd with thick'ning vapours, mourn'd; the Rock,
Projecting o'er the Deep, pour'd down a stream
Of Sorrow, sadd'ning all around:  no sound
Of wood-land Musick echo'd thro' the Grove,
Nor cheerful Rustick hail'd the welcome Morn,
With rural Melody; no glimpse of Joy
Appear'd thro' all the wide extended face
Of things; but all the vast of Nature seem'd
Portentous of approaching Change, and lay
In dreadful expectation of th' event.

To such a scene afflicted Zeuma rose,
From Hymen's spotless joys, when racking Thought,
And kingly Duty rouz'd him to his Care;
With stern command expell'd him from the arms
Of lov'd Zirene, and deny'd his Soul
The only pleasure it could know:  Slave to
The publick Good, he gave the anxious hours
To Business and the State; nor once repin'd
At the increasing Toil:  when, full of Woe,
Whole Crowds appear'd complaining of their Wrongs,
And the dire fury of the Spanish Arms;
With Grief he heard the sad relation, dry'd
The Mourners tears, reliev'd the Needy, chear'd
The broken Heart, and cur'd the Soldier's wounds;
No Soul e'er went dissatisfied away:
Their real Father he appear'd, and was
Belov'd with greater Warmth.  'Twas such was his
Employ, when, breathless with his Speed, arriv'd
A trusty Scout, who brought the dread account
Of dire Almagro's march, with all his Strength,
To force Zirene from her Lord's embrace,
And seize upon his Throne; with haggar'd Eyes,
And fault'ring Tongue he told the hideous Tale;
Describ'd their Numbers, their Array, and all
The various Woes that waited on their Deeds.
But now, so oft the flaming Town, the Glebe
Laid waste, the labour of the Year destroy'd,
The weeping Sire, and ravish'd Dame had vex'd
The mourning Tribes, that all Surprize was lost,
And solitary Grief alone remain'd to
Wail the increasing Ruin:  Zeuma heard,
With inward Anguish, the ungrateful News;
Yet, full of Courage and heroick Warmth,
Forgot not to assume his wonted Care,
And give due orders for the Field.  Beneath
Comagua's walls his Army was encamp'd,
And ev'ry hour increas'd:  their Monarch's fame
In arms, the Love of Liberty, inspir'd
Their eager Souls with noble Zeal to fight,
Or dye with him:  soon as his Plume appear'd
On the remotest Line, a thund'ring Shout,
From all the legions, shook the Clouds, and Joy,
The Gladness dawn'd on ev'ry Face; thro' all
The ranks of War, with never-ceasing toil,
He march'd, greatly serene, t' observe if ought
Was wanting for th' ensuing Fray, to chear
The drooping Soul, commend the Brave, and give
The Doubtful ardour like his own:  This done,
(And night arising sable o'er the world)
Fatigu'd with Care, and longing to indulge
His tend'rest thoughts, to sad Zirene's arms,
And soft endearments, pensive he retir'd;
She, who had treasur'd all her joys in him,
And doated on his Name, who fondly thought
His Stay too tedious, too unkindly long,
And, ever list'ning to each passing step,
Each distant sound, ev'n dy'd for his Approach;
She flew to his Embrace, and with her sweet,
Her ravishing Discourse, reliev'd his woes,
And, for a moment, banish'd all his cares:
But soon, with aggravated pain, they rise,
Anew, and sting him to the Soul; the thought
Of war's uncertain Chance, what various ills
The Vanquish'd suffer, and Zirene's fate,
His lost Zirene, dearer far than Life
Or Empire, with deep anguish fill'd his Heart
And sadden'd all his joys; the Fair attends,
With equal agonies, each changing woe
That clouded o'er his face, to ev'ry groan
Her passion answer'd, and, with streaming eyes,
The moments wept away; 'till Nature claim'd
Repose, and Slumber seal'd each wa'try source,
And dry'd the pearly dew.  Now, unobserv'd,
And left at liberty to mourn, the King
Gave way to sorrow, leaning o'er his Love,
With tenderness beyond expression, gaz'd
O'er all her Form, and, with fast-flowing Tears,
Impearl'd her rosy cheek:  Ye Pow'rs he cry'd,
Must all this Beauty, all this heav'n of charms
Become the prey of Cruelty, and Lust?
Must this fair frame be torn, by brutal Force,
From helpless Altars, and unpitying Gods,
And I unable to revenge the Wrong?
Distracting thought!  can Virtue then become
Indiff'rent to the Skies?  Can Innocence,
Like this, be left unheeded to the rage
Of lawless men?  O Death!  O friendly Death!
Be thou the comfort of my broken Heart,
And let me think no more &mdash; This said, again,
In silence, he bewail'd the sleeping Fair;
'Till, by conflicting passions torn beyond
His Strength, lone, thro' the mid-night gloom, he stray'd
To sooth his troubled thought, and seek relief
In calm reflections on the will of Fate,
And justice of the Gods:  'Twas thro' the dark,
And awful shadows of a gloomy Wood
Made sacred to the Heav'nly Powr's, he roam'd
In expectation of the dawn; when, by
The dim, uncertain glimm'ring of the Moon,
He spy'd the aged Hermit that had giv'n
Such wond'rous prospect of the War, e'er yet
The din of arms was heard; who, bowing low,
Began &mdash; Gladly my soul, illustrious prince!
Acclaims your Virtue, and, with pleasure, views
The wonders of your Reign:  'twas bravely done
To lose the Lover in the King, and yield
Zirene's charms the sacrifice of Peace;
And 'twas as brave to re-commence the War
With Zeal and Vigour when the publick Voice,
And publick Good requir'd; for know, in vain
Ev'n lov'd Zirene's charms had been resign'd
T' abate the Victor's rage, and you had mourn'd
Th' increasing sorrow of your Tribes; since Fraud
And ignominious Arts, with secret lure,
Had sooth'd you into Ruin, and the force
Of arms too late endeavour'd a Reprieve:
The future Age, forgetful of your great,
Your noble ardour in your country's Cause,
Had tarnish'd all your Fame, and grav'd Disgrace
Upon your Tomb; and could your gen'rous Soul
Have e'er endur'd so horrible a thought,
Without the utmost Pangs of dire Remorse,
And Penitence severe?  I know Disdain
Inspires your noble Heart with rage, and that
This instant now, despising Death, it pants,
With double ardour, to begin the Fight,
And, in the foremost ranks of War, dispute
The justice of your Cause &mdash; But great, and long
Have been your Woes, your Life one constant scene
Of Virtue, Truth, and Love:  Zirene too
Is all perfection, yet her tender soul
Is tortur'd with Variety of Ill:
And shall you dye complaining that the Gods
Neglect their Vot'ries here below, and Vice
Alone enjoys their guardian Care?  No, e'er
The crimson Dawn lead on th' expected Day,
The mystick Maze shall be reveal'd, and you
Confess their Deeds are Just &mdash; Far in the deep
Dire Centre of the hallow'd Globe, there flames
A burning Ocean, with eternal rage,
And fires the baleful shores around; oft, rouz'd
To tenfold fury, threats the gloomy arch
Above, and rocks the frighted World; while Floods
Of boiling Sulphur, working wide, ascend
Thro' ev'ry winding Cave, and, roaring loud,
Assail the thund'ring Hill, where Earth-quakes first
Are form'd, and Ruin broods, then, bursting o'er
It's rugged brow, with horrible descent,
And dread Eruption, roll resistless down,
And, waste, with strange destruction, all the Plains
Below.  This is the sad Abode that waits
The impious Man, and such the hideous Path
The shudd'ring Soul must tread.  When Vice prevail'd
Among the First of human Race, the Gods
Uprear'd these flaming Mountains, o'er the Earth,
To warn the guilty Wretch and fright the stern
Relentless Tyrant into Virtue; nor
Uprear'd alone, but, when whole Nations lye
Immers'd in sinful Joys, let loose the Blaze,
Awaken all it's Rage, and give th' allarm
Of Fate; yet, obstinate in low pursuits,
They dance along the flow'ry road, 'till Death
Concludes the Scene, when waiting Furies sieze
The spotted Ghost, self conscious of the Fires
That must torment it for a length of years,
And sink together down &mdash; While Virtue's sons,
Who rul'd their Passions with a steady hand,
And, thro' her influence, bore the ills of Life
Constant as Fate, and silent as the Grave;
While they, with calm, entire submission, wait
Their future Doom unanxious for the Time:
For such as these the Heav'nly Pow'rs prepar'd
A scene of Glory, where, unvex'd with Cares,
And anxious Thought, they might serenely breath
Immortal Joy, and Pleasure without end.
Behold yon lustrous Orb, that rules the Night
And silvers o'er the World; 'tis there, 'tis there
We shall reside in Happiness supream,
The cares, the ills, the sorrows of this Life,
This painful Life, in Bliss for ever drown'd.

&mdash;Fir'd with the glorious thought, my raptur'd soul
Shoots Forward on her airy Way, and longs
To hold sublime communion with the Dead.
Hark!  thro' the silent shade, thy Father's  Ghost
Invites us to approach the happy Fields,
And deigns a Prospect of the future World.
Then, with collected courage, arm thy mind
To view the wond'rous Scene, least Madness rush
On thy tormented Brain at the dire gloom,
And fearful horrors of the realms of Death,
And drive thee raving o'er th' astonish'd Globe.

&mdash;He said; and, turning swiftly round, began
His solemn Charms; when sudden darkness veil'd
The starry Skies, and hollow murm'ring gales
Sung dreadful in the trees; red Meteors flash'd
Along the troubled Air; and, from beneath,
Loud, in-bred thunders shook the stedfast Earth;
Unnumbered Ghosts, all pale with hostile wounds,
Stalk'd o'er the Green, and fill'd the night's dark gloom
With ghastly terrour and distracting groans:
Silence succeeds, vanish the Ghosts away,
And Earth no longer shades; the lab'ring Clouds
Unveil the Heav'ns, and, in their stony caves,
The slumb'ring Winds their weary pinions rest.

Then Sleep's still influence seiz'd the drowzy King,
And down he sunk unable to resist
The pressing weight of the prevailing God:
But Inspiration wak'd his inward pow'rs,
And rous'd light Fancy, in her thousand forms,
To strike the wond'rous Vision on the mind.

First his great Father's shade, with glory crown'd,
Descends, and, thro' the fluid realms of Air,
Bears the young Monarch, swift as Tempests fly
When the grim Ruler of the raging winds,
Drives down their fury o'er th' Atlantic Seas,
And, in a moment, to the farthest verge
Of the vex'd Ocean, heaps the roaring waves.

The chrystal Gates of Cynthia's silver orb
Unfold, and, up the portals bright ascent,
The rev'rend Guardian leads his earthly Charge
Entranc'd in raptures; when the glorious scene,
To his attentive view, unveil'd it's charms:
For their soft Pleasures, in eternal rounds,
For ever circle with an easy wing;
All that the realms of either India boast,
Or Africk's, regions, or Europa's lands,
By turns, delight the happy tribes, and more,
Ten thousand more, than man's Experience knows,
Or Fancy forms, maintain eternal rule,
And bless th' Immortals with continual joy.

Musick, thro' ev'ry shade sweet-warbling, breathes
Soft gladness on the Soul; the dulcet Voice
Attempers the responding Lyre, the Lyre
Attunes the vocal Breeze, the vocal Breeze,
Low-whisp'ring thro' the tuneful boughs, invokes
The falling Wave, the falling Wave, with hoarse,
Loud murmur breaking, solemn, on the shore,
Deepens the Harmony with graver sound;
Now, intermission of the Wave, Wind, Lyre,
Or Voice, varies the Pleasure; now, renew'd
In general Chorus, all at once conspire
To swell the gen'ral Concert, and compleat the Charm.
&mdash;Eternal Verdue chears the gladsome green,
And od'rous flow'rs, for ever blooming, waft
Unfading sweets, and fume the wanton gale:
From the slope Hills, descend the trickling streams,
And, thro' the fruitful vales, o'er sands of Gold,
In gentle currents, smoothly roll along;
The Mountain's brow with tufted woods is crown'd,
With sparkling Gems the silent grot's emblaz'd,
And luscious Plenty gladdens ev'ry field:
No wint'ry Snows, or summer Suns infest
The blissful Climes, nor War's destructive rage
Lays waste the regions, and deforms the plain;
But heav'n-born Love, and everlasting Spring
Dance hand in hand, and lead the smiling Hours,
All gay with newborn Happiness and Joy.

Thro' spicy forests, and thro' flow'ry fields,
The sweet abode of Souls for ever bless'd!
The princely Ghost his raptur'd offspring led
To that sublime Retreat, where Patriot shades,
In matchless pleasures, and supream delights,
Enjoy the great Reward their Virtues earn'd,
With long fatigue, and endless toils, below;
There pointed, to his view, th' illustrious Chiefs,
Who scorning Bribes, and all the baits of Sense,
Trod, with undaunted soul, the paths of Death,
When Freedom claim'd the Sword, and Honour call'd to Arms.

Zymron, the best, and bravest of mankind,
Tow'rs with superiour glory, and presides
Amidst the noblest Heroes of the Globe;
Dread less he looks, as when his rightful arms
O'ercame the Tyrants of an hundred Realms,
And made that bold attempt to free the western World.

His mighty Ancestor, of deathless Name,
The next in order treads the social green,
Round his distinguish'd head bright Virtue ties
The Lawrel Wreath, and glories in his deeds;
Nations, preserv'd by his indulgent care,
Shout his applause, and Fame's eternal Trump,
Fill'd with his praises, shakes the Tyrant's throne.

Alascar, chief of Montezuma's line,
Stands at his side, severe his awful bow,
As when, impartial to his country's Laws,
He doom'd his Sons to ignominious Death,
And, in the Patriot's zeal, restrain'd the Parent's tears.

The brave Atalgah, stedfast as the Earth
Pois'd on its self, and glorious as the Sun
In it's meridian height, transported hears
The wonders of his toilsome march rehears'd
With loud acclaim, when, scorching in the Heat,
He patient bore the raging pangs of Thirst,
'Till the last fainting Soldier was refresh'd
With frequent draughts from the enliv'ning Spring.

See!  fair Amrena, with majestick Front,
And Eye sublime, among the Mightiest stand,
Fond of the liquid Death, which freed her Soul
From the proud insults of the Victor's rage;
Surrounding Chiefs admire th' heroick deed,
And hail her dauntless Mind which dar'd to lead
An Host to War, and, by the dint of Sword,
Restore lost Freedom to her mourning Realm.

A thousand more, the champions of the world!
Dwell here encircled with superior Bliss,
And dream of dangers, and of toil no more.

Virtue (began the kingly Shade) at length,
You see, rewards the troubles of her Sons;
In these delightful haunts she reigns on high,
And pours down Pleasures, with profusive hand,
Grateful as evening showers to sun-burnt fields,
Or pearly dew-drops in the morning ray.
&mdash;Happy the Prince who, with incessant toil,
Defends his People, and, to Freedom's cause,
Devotes his Strength, his Honour, and his Life;
For he, when Death dissolves his mortal frame,
Shall hither rise, and breath immortal joy:
But if, with careless, or tyrannick rule
He draws down sorrows on his suff'ring realm,
A dire revenge must seize his guilty Soul,
And flaming tortures wait upon his crimes:
For Kings were destin'd, by divine decree,
To stand the stedfast Guardians of mankind,
To prop the sinking State, and, in the front
Of danger, combat for the publick Good:
Beside, should Monarchs slumber o'er their Charge,
Or, lull'd in golden dreams, forget their care,
What Guard!  what Safety can the nations find
From home-bred Factions, and invading Foes!
Or, when resolv'd to seize unbounded sway,
They spoil the Subject of his dearest Right,
What dreadful woes must take their turns to reign!
What scenes of Horror must deform the land!

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

&mdash;But now, descending to the Seats of woe,
And vengful torments, where the sons of Men
Are rack'd for all th' enormities of Life,
We for a while must leave these happy plains.
He said; and, plunging from the argent World,
Sails on the Winds, and bears his Son along:
At last upon an huge Volcano's brink,
With clouds of gloomy smoak involv'd, they stoop,
And sink immediate down the vast Profound;
Nor stay'd 'till (thro' unnumber'd caverns past,
Th' abodes of Fear, of Horror and Despair)
They reach'd the dreadful dungeons of the Great.
Where bound in adamantine chains, they lye
On beds of raging Fire, and no hope
Of comfort, or a kind reprieve from pain;
From pain, which, ev'ry hour increasing, gives
A keener twinge; while fiercer flames prepare
Their eager vengeance, and exert their rage;
While round, the sad companions of their crimes,
Condemn'd to endless woe, attend their Lords,
And aid the furies, and increase the fires.

Here haughty Nimroc, plung'd in burning wave,
No longer grasps at universal rule,
Or wastes the Nations with destructive arms;
But, inly tortur'd with incessant pangs,
Reflects with horror on his impious schemes.

Fix'd in a ruddy car of burning Steel,
With sullen sadness, proud Guascara mourns
His fond ambition to be thought a God,
While, o'er the scorching soil, he's dragg'd along,
And scornful Daemons aggravate his woe,
With pageant grandeur, and disdainful state.

Tlaxcalla's vaunt, great Zagnar's martial son,
Extended on the rack, no more complains
That Realms are wanting to employ his Sword;
But, circled with innumerable Ghosts,
Who print their keenest vengeance on his soul,
For all the wrongs, and slaughters of his Reign,
Howls out repentance to the deafned skies,
And shakes Hell's concave with continual groans.

Ten thousand thousand more whom Fame, records
As the dread Tyrants of the tortur'd globe,
Midst the dire rigours of surrounding flames,
Clank their huge fetters, and, with ceaseless yell,
Bewail the frantick fury of their Lives,
Which forc'd down all the vengeance of the Gods.

This dreadful scene they survey'd, again the Ghost
Broke the long silence, and his lore renew'd:
These, these are they, the execrable souls
Who vaunted heav'nly birth, yet scorning Truth,
And Virtue's sacred laws, acted worse deeds
Than all th' Infernals could inspire; the worst,
The basest of the sons of men, whose joy
Was Murther, whose delight was Death, who thought
Mankind was destin'd only to adore
Their transient glories, live upon their breath;
Who laugh'd at Justice, trampled on the Laws,
And gave whole Armies to the rage of war;
In short, the Flatt'rer's Theme, the Villain's prey,
Alive abhor'd by all, and curs'd by all when dead.

O let thy Soul avoid the downward path
Which leads to these dark realms; let not the rage
Of dire Ambition, or the lure of Sloth
Tarnish thine honour, or defame thy rule;
But let thy Country's weal, thy People's love
Gild all the actions of thy Life, for these
Will give a long, sincere, and lasting joy,
Shed on thy future name eternal sweets,
And waft thy tow'ring soul, with gladsome wing,
To endless pleasures in the Worlds above;
While trembling Tyrants start at ev'ry shade,
Mistrust their Friends, and dread the hostile Dart;
While Guilt, and Shame commemorate their deeds
And, in these fiery Lakes, their tainted souls
Shall groan whole ages unrepriev'd away.

Lastly, let Freedom animate thy thought,
And rouze thy utmost vigour in it's cause;
Disdain to live, when Fate inslaves thy realm,
And binds in servile chains the mourning tribes:
'Tis glorious for a King to fall beneath
An host of foes, when fighting for his Charge;
And he who, struggling in the fields of death,
Oppos'd his juster arms, shall mourn the deed,
And give his wounded Coarse a friendly grave
With endless praise adorn'd, with tears bedew'd.
&mdash;He ceas'd, returning thro' the dreadful gloom,
And, swift as light'ning, hurl'd by Jove's red arm
Along the skies, from the dire mountain, bears
His dreadless Offspring to the secret shade,
In which the Hermit waited to reverse
The Charm, and urge the Hero to the field.
For now th' expected dawn, ascending slow,
Purpled the East, and faintly streak'd the skies
With the first glimm'rings of returning light.

Deep-musing from his Trance the thoughtful King
Arose; when thus the Sage, Now Zeuma see
Th' indulgence of the Gods, and own their care,
For ever mindful of the Brave, and Good,
And studious of their welfare:  Thrice I've come,
Commission'd from above, to warn thee of
Approaching Ill, to fix thy wav'ring soul
On Virtue, and relieve thy cares with scenes
Of Happiness and Joy; my Time's expir'd,
And I resign thee to the War; be strong,
Be stedfast, nor indulge thy doating heart
In anxious doubts for thy Zirene's Fate,
For I will be her Guard, 'till friendly Death
Shall join her longing Shade, with thine.  He said,
And, wond'rous to relate!  his feeble eyes
Began to brighten like Aurora's beam;
His wrinkles vanish'd, and a rosy bloom
Dawn'd blushing o'er his cheek; his silver hairs,
To amber ringlets chang'd, flow'd graceful down
His iv'ry neck, and, from his shoulders, spread
Two sail-broad pinions, gay with every dye
That paints the show'ry Arch; a golden wreath
Of beaming light, like Phosphor's circlet, stream'd
Around his head, and lighten'd all the shade:
With joy the Monarch hail'd his guardian Pow'r
Reveal'd, and, with attentive eye, pursu'd
His airy Progress thro' th' ethereal Void.

Now, ev'ry moment loud'ning by degrees,
The dreadful musick of the field began
Th' allarm of Battle, and, with sprightly note
Wak'ning the Morn, resounded to the skies,
And rouz'd the hostile squadrons to the fray;
In troops they throng on either side, and form
The long-connected ranks of War; from line
To line the busy Captains hast along,
And teach the horrid duty of the day:
A deaf'ning murmur, like the dying roar
Of Seas wide-breaking on the rocky strand,
From the collected host ascends, and Death,
And Horror, with increasing joy, o'erlook
The scene below:  a length of shining arms
Stretches, in thick array, along the field,
And, widely gleaming to the illumin'd east,
Reflects the blaze of day, and gilds the plain
From end to end.  So, where the setting Sun,
Against the huge Metropolis, extends
His evening beam, the windows flame with streams
Of fluctuating light, and to the verge
Of the broad landscape shine.  Surrounded with
A crowd of chiefs, majestick Zeuma stands
In the grim front of war, and, full of thought
Surveys both armies round; Compassion melts
His manly heart for thousands that must fall
Th' unhappy victims of the day, and tinge
The smoaking plains with blood; yet on his brow
Firm Resolution sits sublime, his eye
Darts Terror on his foes; consid'rate Warmth,
And Valour, free from Pride, or brutal Rage,
Inspire his Soul; and, with untroubled thought,
He gives his deathful Orders thro' the field.

Mean time Zirene, with the dawning light,
Awoke, and, missing from her side her dear,
Unhappy Lord, all pale, and trembling rose
Immediate to enquire his Fate, and take
One sad farewel, e'er yet the chance of war
Could snatch the transient joy:  for this, inspir'd
With all the courage such a love-sick soul
Could know, she left the Town, with beating heart,
And hasten'd to the tented field; a train
Of weeping Virgins waited on her steps,
And shar'd in all her woe; in ev'ry face
Dread apprehension reign'd of future ill,
But most in hers, in hers appear'd the marks
Of agony beyond the reach of words;
Too big for tears wild sorrow had eclips'd
Her charms, and clouded ev'ry grace; yet still
She look'd so fair, so wonderfully fair,
That the rough Veteran, grown old in fight,
And harden'd in the work of Death, with grief,
With pity ey'd her as she mov'd along,
And wept who never wept before:  from far,
With piercing eye, she sought her much lov'd Lord;
From far he met her eager glance, and ran
To her embrace; with equal Warmth she strain'd
Him in her arms; but neither spoke &mdash; Excess
Of passion reft the use of speech, and sighs,
And broken accents murmur'd out their woe:
In vain thy strove, with mutual eagerness,
To breath the sorrows of their souls, and tell
The fears, the cares, and jealousies of love;
The mighty anguish mock'd the fond attempt,
And, like an heaving earth-quake, labour'd all
Within &mdash; At last th' Iberian trumpets gave
Th' expected sound of war, and, with a shout
That rent the troubled air, the hostile troops
Reply &mdash; Rouz'd with the noise, the monarch starts
Awaken'd to his charge; yet once again
Renews his sad endearments, and again
Receives her close embrace, then sighs &mdash; Adieu&mdash;
Adieu she answers, and, with dying eyes,
Sinks fainting on the ground.  So fades, so droops
The Sun-enamour'd Flow'r, which, all day long,
Had watch'd his circlet with continual gaze,
And seem'd to live upon his warmth; so dies,
When gloomy vapours intercept his beams,
Or, down the western skies, he rolls amain
And to the night's dark rule resigns the world.

Zirene borne away, dread Zeuma, fir'd
Anew with glory, and his country's cause,
Gives the dread signal, and, in clouds of dust,
The mingling hosts engage; dire Discord leads
Them on, and, o'er the dubious battle, soars
In triumph; here impels the sordid wretch
With hope of plunder, and desire of gain;
Here, with false honour, fires the frantick soul
To cruelty, and rage:  Almagro's heart
She tortures with ill-fated love, and works
His brain to Phrenzy at Zirene's name;
Mad, with Despair and Jealousy, he roams
The combat round, to sooth his luckless flame
With Zeuma's death.  But he with caution stood
Aloof, and, where his routed troops retir'd,
With timely aid renew'd him to appear
Conspicuous in the battle's head, and dare
The utmost dangers of the day.  So, when
The gath'ring tempest first begins to rage,
And toss the foaming deep, the master sits
Securely on the stern, and give the helm
To an inferiour hand; but as the winds
Augment their roar, th' enormous billows swell
Like mountains to the clouds, and seas, and skies
Are lost in the increasing gloom; he guides
Himself th' endanger'd bark, and thro' the midst
Of light'nings, winds, and waves, undaunted drives
Along.  Now War and Fury, raving fierce,
Enkindled all their terrors, all their din
Grew madly loud; the horrid clank of arms
The noise of shouting to the skies:  Confusion storm'd
Amid the thickest fray, and, raging wide,
With violence extream o'erturn'd the ranks,
And scatter'd Fate around; trembles the Earth
Beneath the pond'rous weight of War, and groans
Afflicted when the Mighty fall; while streams
Of reeking crimson drench the thirsty soil,
And float along the plain:  th' impatient threats
Of eager Passion, the heart-piercing groans
Of Agony, and Pain, the frantick yell
Of shudd'ring Fear, the never-ceasing roar
Of martial enginery, in concert dire,
Rebellow'd hideous from the neigh'bring hills,
And echo'd on the breeze:  scarce louder rings
The universal sound of Ruin, when
Dread Earth-quakes cleave the shaken soil, when towns,
And mountains to the centre prone descend,
And Sorrow mourns the waste.  At length o'erpowr'd,
Distress'd, and broken, Zeuma's fainting troops
Give way; and dire Almagro, grimly pleas'd,
Collects his squadrons, and, in firm array,
Pursues th' advantage with unbated warmth,
And energy of rage:  but first, the great,
The matchless Hero of the western world
Fell in the midst of the encount'ring hosts,
And liberty with him expir'd:  an hill
Of slain, ennobled in their deaths by him,
Rose round his Coarse; no single arm could boast
The honour of his fall, but wounds on wounds,
Repeated thro' the whole attack, dismiss'd
His mighty soul to mingle with the gods.

So when the column, which had long sustain'd
The pond'rous roof of some proud building, breaks,
With sudden crash, beneath the load, the pile,
With horrible convulsion, shakes throughout,
The arches tremble, and, in clouds of dust,
With huge destruction, tumble from above,
And heap a pile of ruins all around.

Their Leader lost, the fighting few which yet
Remain'd, disdaining to survive, throng around
His lov'd remains, and with collected might,
Like lions struggling in the toils, sustain
The utmost efforts of their conqu'ring foes;
'Till Death gigantick, striding o'er the field,
Fought in their front, and, with resistless strength,
Stretch'd the thin squadron on the bloody ground;
When, tow'ring o'er the heap, he rear'd on high
His dreadful banner, and, with barb'rous joy,
Snatch'd the loud trump of fame, and shook the world
With blasts of horror, and the sound of arms.
