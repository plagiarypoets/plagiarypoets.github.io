Th' appointed Time is come;&mdash;
Punctual as Lovers to the promis'd Hour
At Midnight Assignation, all appear,
All Hearts elated, fill'd with golden Hopes,
And villainous Intent, to rob his Friend:
His Friend; no, Friendship's banish'd hence,
Nought but an empty Name.  Is he my Friend,
Whose avaricious Mind, basely exulting,
Would joyfully behold my Pockets stripp'd
T' enrich his own?  'Tis inconsistent.&mdash;

Pleasure now sparkles in each eager Eye,
For see, the Card-Table appears.  Eager Impatience
Swells each Bosom; a Challenge strait is given,
And is as soon accepted.  Now Silence reigns;
Their loud-Mouths stopt, and busy Heads
Contriving how their Adversaries to beat,
And win the shining Pelf; except when Fortune frowns,
And fills the Gamester's Hand with losing Cards,
Then murmuring Oaths are heard, uplifted Eyes
Then Brows contract.  All's Anarchy within.
With envious Eye his joyful Foe he views,
To think his Cash reduc'd; but yet the pleasing Thought
That the next Game may chance it to return,
Becalms his ruffled Soul.  As on the boist'rous Main,
When roaring Billows mount the strong ribb'd Bark,
And toss her to and fro, then Fear possesses
Every Breast; anon the Winds abate,
Some wish'd-for Port appears; that Fear dispels,
And in its Stead produces pleasing Hope.
Hope urges him again to try his Fate,
Still Fortune frowns, till all his shining Ore,
So lovely to his Sight, (oh!  dire Reverse)
Is gone to enrich his Adversary's Store.
Then Thought intrudes, unpleasing Guest,
Dull, melancholy Thought!  Where's Friendship fled?
Will he who now possesses all thy Wealth
Refund thee any back?  No, not a Piece,
Ev'n if that Piece would save thee from Destruction;
But in Return give bitter biting Jests.  This th' Effects
Of Gaming; for where the Heart it enters
Peace is banish'd, and in its Room,
As Fear or Hope prevail, th' unruly Passions
Declare the troubled Mind.
