Unhappy daughter of distress and woe,
Whate'er thy sorrows, or whoe'er thou art,
For thee the tears of charity shall flow,
Warm from the purest fountain of the heart.

Perhaps, though now neglected and forlorn,
A parent once survey'd thee with delight,
The idol of a father's heart alone,
Or the lov'd darling of a mother's sight.

For thee, perhaps, they watch'd, and toil'd, and pray'd,
On thy sweet innocence with transport hung;
And well they thought their tender care repaid,
To hear the artless music of thy tongue;

When dawning reason shed her ray benign,
And all thy excellence became reveal'd,
How did they see thy op'ning virtue shine,
And hear thy praise with raptures ill conceal'd.

For who, alas!  can tell thy secret worth,
What soft angelic virtues might appear;
That bosom, laid defenceless on the earth,
Might once be grateful, generous and sincere.

Some base deceiver practis'd to betray,
Might win thy easy faith, destroy thy fame,
Then cast thee, like a loathsome weed, away,
The sport of fortune, and the child of shame.

Poor wanderer!  perhaps thou could'st not find
The liberal hand, the slender gifts to spare,
Insatiate avarice the soul confin'd,
Or timid prudence disbeliev'd thy prayer.

Then from the world neglected and forlorn,
Careless of life, and hopeless of relief,
Thy agonizing heart retir'd to mourn,
And breath'd its last in unmolested grief.

Unhappy shade!  whate'er thy lot has been,
From sin at last and sorrow thou art free:
Thy debt to nature too is fully paid,
And wounded pity pays her debt to thee.
