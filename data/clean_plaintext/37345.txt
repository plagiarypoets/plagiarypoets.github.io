In HOLWOOD'S groves when the gay gard'ner, SPRING,
Threw his loose greens about on every thing:
Two maudling Shepherds, very dull and flat,
(This was nam'd PITT-CLOUT, DUN-CUDDY, that,)
Plodding along with slow and heavy pace,
Care, and stale drunkenness, in either face.
But soon they broach'd a keg of humming ale,
And sate them down to carol and regale,
Till rous'd at length to rivalry of song,
They call BULLAEMON from the rustic throng,
And ask him to decide which sings the sweeter,
Which gives the properest sense in happiest metre.
The umpire settled &mdash; first they take a whet,
Then in the usual way propose the bet.
The former from his pouch some ribbands drew,
And stak'd them boldly, Red and Green and Blue.
The latter, being the more knowing stager,
Produc'd some gilded flow'r-wove crowns, to wager.
Then PITT-CLOUT began with tuneful pride,
DUN-CUDDY also tunefully replied.

PITTI-CLOUT.
How very fresh the grass appears to be,
Yet what avails, I pray, fresh grass to me!
For I can only ponder on the hour,
When first I fall'd in love with POLLY POWER.

DUN-CUDDY.
How very bright the Sun shines in the sky,
Yet for the brightest sunshine, what cares I?
I'm grown indifferent to the finest day,
Since SALLY PLUNDER stole my heart away.

PITTI-CLOUT.
Till now I never  lov'd the wanton game,
Plain girls, or pretty, was to me the same.
But POLLY POWER so buxom is, and clever,
That I could sing of POLLY POWER for ever.

DUN CUDDY.
I always was inclined to toy and kiss,
A glass, or lass, to me ne'er comed amiss;
But since to SALLY I gave up my mind,
I have no joy in wenches, beer, or wind.

PITTI-CLOUT.
My flocks may straggle round; I've lost my reason,
And see how close I've shear'd them out of season:
Yet I will shear them close and closer still,
Until of POLL I've had my WICKED WILL.

DUN CUDDY.
For flocks and herds, I don't care, not a bit,
I pens, or lets them loose, as I thinks fit.
Yet though like them I thoughtless seems to range,
My love for SALLY PLUNDER cannot change.

PITTI-CLOUT.
My POLL is generous, she lets me take
Whate'er she buys at market or the wake;
Of plums and apricots, I've borrowed dozens,
To give my BROTHERS, UNCLES, AUNTS, and COUSINS.

DUN CUDDY.
All that SAL earns is mine, I never ask it,
But puts my hands at pleasure in her basket;
And many a pudding, custard, pie, and jelly,
She makes for me, that I may fill my belly.

PITTI-CLOUT.
On POLLY'S face I'd look till I was blind,
For POLLY'S sake, I'd murder all my kind!
And if she flouts me, as I am a sinner,
I'd fire the village, that I would, to win her!

DUN-CUDDY.
If e'er by chance I fears to lose my jewel,
I grows sour-temper'd, and most gallows cruel,
I'd cut the farmer's throat, or kill the Sexton,
I be so mad, whenever she has vexed one.

PITTI-CLOUT.
Uncommon kind in truth POLL is to me,
There's nothing upon earth I loves like She,
And often with my hugs I've nearly stifled her,
But yet I ne'er enjoy'd, altho' I've rifled her.

DUN-CUDDY.
Fore George, I've held my Sally in my arms,
And feasted many a time upon her charms;
Yet, my BLACK CHARLEY, if I lie, supplant me,
No real pleasure would the Hussey grant me.

PITTI-CLOUT.
When to the Justice I was forced to go,
And as a witness was brought up, you know,
So much had POLLY POWER disturb'd my sense,
I HAD NO MEM'RY TO GIVE EVIDENCE.

DUN-CUDDY.
I too forgets at times what once I was,
But SALLY PLUNDER is alone the cause;
For who can think of things awhile gone by,
When they're so much in love as you and I.

PITTI-CLOUT.
Tho' IRISH PAT whene'er he sees me cries,
"O, Blood and Ounds, the Devil burn your eyes!"
Yet let him jaw, and his potatoes fling,
While with my POLL I'm greater than a King.

DUN CUDDY.
Let SCOTTISH SANDY'S furious eye-balls roll,
And let him say, "DUN-CUDDY damn your soul!"
What boots it me, his oaths, and angry air,
For SALLY PLUNDER smiles away my care.

PITTI-CLOUT.
Tell me, DUN-CUDDY, and the prize is thine,
What thing is that by Blockheads called divine,
Which can do nothing wrong, yet does no good,
And thrives on rapine, treachery, and blood?

DUN-CUDDY.
But first inform me, and the stake I'll yield,
What, are those pois'nous reptiles of the field,
Which may be influenced by the sound of Gold,
TO WASTE THE LAND, AND DESOLATE THE FOLD?

BULLEMON.
Enough, enough, ye Shepherds!  cease the strain,
I now must interrupt, you, to complain;
For while I listen'd to your rhiming clink,
You've eat up all my meat, and drank my drink;
You've stol'n my powder'd wing, and what is worse,
Have even pick'd my Pocket of my purse.
And yet you always call me, when you're mellow,
A very decent, loyal, patient fellow.
But I'll not bear it long, ye dirty Elves!
I'm sure you only sing to please yourselves;
And to my mind, unless your manners alter,
THE ONLY PRIZE YE MERIT IS A HALTER.
