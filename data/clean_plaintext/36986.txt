No more of feare, for lo his impious brat,
Lookes now to be admitted; this is that;
We call Dispaire, with ghastly looks he stands,
And poisons, ropes, or poin-yard fills his handes,
Still ready to do hurt; one step, no more,
Reaches from hence unto damnations dore.
This is that Passion gives a man instruction,
To wrest the Scriptures to his owne destruction;
And makes him think while he on earth doth dwel
He feeles the very torturing pangs of hell;
It makes men rage, like furies screech and houle,
With exclamations horrible and foule,
Like Monsters more then men.  Onely damnation
Is in their mouthes; nor mercy nor salvation
They seeme to hope for:  they extreamely feare
Some monstrous shapes which seeme for to appeare
Through their imaginations; and the paine
That they in soule and conscience do sustaine,
All earthly tortures doth so much exceed,
That they have thought them selves in hell indeed
Oh what repentant lives, some vow to live,
If God would but once more vouchsafe to give
Their health and hope againe:  then they would spend
Their lives, and good, unto no other end
But wholly for his glory:  yet theres now
Some living that have quite forget that vow,
God give them grace to looke into their error,
Or they wil one day find a double terror,
Some in this agony have little will,
To any thing, unlesse it be to kill,
Or make themselves away; whereto the Divell,
The author and chiefe causer of this evill,
(Unlesse that God in mercy him prevents)
Is ready to provide him instruments,
I even quake to thinke what humors be,
Attending on this hellish maladee;
And for some cause I mean not here to shew them,
But pray that all had grace for to eschew them:
Now some do thinke this passion being taken,
Can very hardly be again forsaken;
But let none thinke so; for why?  God in distresse
Doth never leave man quite without redresse:
Nor can we say that he hath left us voyd,
Of helpe for this, when ere we are anoy'd
Through Satans guile; for pittying our case,
He leaves us hope of favour and of grace,
If wee'l lay hold on't; which to make more cleare,
He let his everlasting love appeare,
In highest measure, by the sacrifice
Of CHRIST his sonne for our iniquities;
And also, did not sinne thus make us blind,
For ever greefe of body and of mind,
He hath ordain'd a salve:  All Christians know
(Or should at least) the spring from whence doth flow
A pretious liquor that will quickly cure,
Our strongest Passions, (if the cup be pure)
Or if we do not so presume as stand,
And lap it here and there with our owne hand,
And the all-only cause of Desperation;
Which from all good-men I do wish as farre,
As earth's low center from the highest star,
But now dispaire or distrust is twofold,
One sort of which I have already told,
Being concerning matters of salvation,
The horriblest and fearful'st desperation,
But th' other is alone of earthly things,
Yet mighty disadvantage with it brings,
Where it gets entrance; this makes many loath,
To undertake great matters cause through sloth
They do dispaire to reach them; yea it breeds
A carelessnesse in man, and thence proceeds
Not a few treasons; for the breach of law,
Makes many times the subject in such awe,
That he dispaires of pardon for his ill;
And therefore not alone remaines in't still,
But being guilty, for to salve one sore
Incurs the danger of a thousand more;
Wil for assurance to Rebellion runne:
Besides, theres some dispairing of their cause,
And being brought to triall by the lawes,
For some offence are obstinately mute:
To these forsooth the commons do impute
A manly Resolution; cause thereby,
They save their landes to their posterity;
But sure there is no wise-man wil commend
Him that so desperately seeks his end;
And wilfully doth cast away himselfe
(Body and soule perhaps) to save his pelfe,
To some survivors; where as if he bide
On hope, and not dispaire for to be tride
According to the lawes, he may be cleer'd,
And quitted of the danger he so fear'd,
As some have beene:  Besides, if we indure,
But a small paine, if we despaire of cure,
Ease or amends, 'twil make it seem to be
Unsufferable; whereas if that we
Have any Hope, the ease we looke to win
Will mitigate the torture we are in;
His winter toyle what Ploughman could sustain;
If he despair'd of his harvest gaine?
And the strong'st army needs must faint and fly,
If it despaire before of victory.
But to conclude it must be understood,
Dispaires a Passion that is no time good,
'Tis alway hurtfull; and I can observe
Nothing whereto a man may make it serve,
Unlesse to helpe a troope of cowards fight:
For could a man lead them past hope of flight,
Where they should see there were no remedy,
But they must dye or get the victory;
Despaire in that case may give them the day,
That would have lost it to have run away.
