Sweete sweetned be the houres, the daies, the monthes and times,
Wherein with sweet conceipts my soule, thy sweetened favor climes
Sweete be thy lookes, thy touch, thy speach, thy gate and all
Ten thousand sweets betide thee still, whose sweetnes staines them all.
Ye floures whose motlie hues so pranke in Natures pride,
Do shrowd your selves, and for my sweete, your beauties lay aside.
Ye temprate westerne winds, whose aire yeilds sweetned breath
Denie your sweete to be as hers, whose sweet yeelds life or death
Ye deintie tuned fowles whose notes do decke the spring
Confesse in hearing of her soundes, your sweets small pleasure bring
Ye christall sacred springs, ye vales and mountaines hie,
Whose pleasant walkes her passage decks, and spreading favours die
Agree with me in this, my sweete (surpassing far)
Excels the sweetnes of you all, and doth your pleasures bar.
