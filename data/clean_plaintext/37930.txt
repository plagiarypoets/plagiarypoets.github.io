O Lovely Virgin!  thee of yore
To manly Sense, Good-humour bore,
Whom with the Wood-Nymphs he espied
Sporting on Ladon's flowery side,
While simple Nature was rever'd,
And Truth the sylvan altar rear'd.
There with the Graces didst thou stray,
Who, smitten with thy infant play,
Gave thee a robe of purest white,
A girdle of transparent light:
Till now mature, with blushes chaste,
They join'd thy willing hand to Taste.
He led thee to th' Aonian mount,
Where bathing in the lucid fount,
Thou sought'st with speed the hallow'd quire,
And heard'st with joy Apollo's lyre.
Each Muse attun'd her sweetest lays,
Intent to share thy heartfelt praise.

Soft inmate of the soul refin'd!
To modest merit never blind!
Whose lips are always slow to blame,
Whose warm applause is more than fame.&mdash;
Proud in its lone retreat to spy
Virtue which shuns the illiberal eye,
To save from Error's partial gloom,
And bid Desert its rank assume;
Whom Envy views with look malign,
And shrinking, owns thy power divine;
Whom hasty Censure's flippant train,
And bigot Spleen, assail in vain;
Before whom Malice stands confest,
Howe'er by wit or fancy drest;
Oh!  heed thy suppliant's humble prayer!
Do thou, O Goddess, still be near!
From falshood and from flattery free,
Still may his bosom glow with thee!
