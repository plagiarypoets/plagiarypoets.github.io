Oh!  thou, from whose warm urn these waters flow,
Which bathe the fading lip of malady,
Whether thou sitt'st on crystal throne below,
Blessing thy balsam streamlets as they flee,
Or whether still I should not turn to Thee
Who dwell'st all-potent in that upward sphere,
Whence thou suppliest the earth, the stream, the sea,
Nor scorn'st the poorest, palest suppliant here,
Vouchsafe, to e'en a prayer like mine, to lend thine ear.&mdash;

Is there a charm in this perennial draught,
To bid the wife for child &mdash; for husband live?
Will the mysterous fountain, when 'tis quaff'd,
This priceless boon &mdash; this blissful treasure give?
Will it aloof the withering canker drive,
That eats the rose just as its leaves are spread?
Will it discomfit the dark fiends which thrive
But on the banquet of the youthful dead?
Oh!  then be with the fount our nuptial garland fed.

Floats there upon the wave a healing power
To guard the mother for the infant son?
Nor doom to others' care the helpless hour
Of him, our first, our lov'd &mdash; our only one?
Clifton!  will he by they sweet cup thus shun
The orphan's lot, nor mourn a mother's care?
Forth let thy bounteous, blessed waters run!
Since they're endow'd with all this power to spare,&mdash;
This is a friend's, a husband's, father's fondest prayer.
