No more my Muse her shepherd's weeds shall wear,
But change her oaten-pipe for trumpets loud,
And sing of noble deeds which long have slept;
Fierce warrs and faithful loves shall grace my song:
Come, Holy Virgin!  chiefest of the nine
Assist my genius and inspire my theme.
A gentle Knight was riding on the plain,
In mighty arms and silver shield array'd,
Wherein appear'd old dints of deeper wounds;
His angry deed chiding the foaming bit
Disdain'd the curb:  a valiant knight he seem'd,
For noble deeds and fierce encounters form'd;
Upon his breast he bore a bloody cross,
The dear rememb'rance of his dying Lord,
Whom be ador'd as living evermore;
The Mark adorn'd his shield, emblem of Hope
Which in HIS help he had:  in deed and word
Faithful he was; yet seem'd oft'times afraid;
Fearful he seem'd yet dreaded was by all:
Pound on a mighty enterprize, conferr'd
By GLORIANA, Queen of Fairy-Land;
He long'd to prove his valor on his foe
A Dragon horrible:  beside him rode
A virtuous Lady on a snow-white steed,
Herself much fairer, veil'd her beauties were
And cover'd with a mourning robe, as one
That inly pin'd from some corroding woe:
A milk-white lamb she led, that emblem seem'd
Of her pure self; descended from old kings
That late had stretch'd their sceptres o'er the world,
'Till that foul fiend sore ravag'd all the land,
And cast them out from all their old domains:
Them to avenge, this knight from far she brought,
And him compell'd with the constraints of virtue
To rid her of her foe.  And as they went
The day with clouds was  suddenly o'ercast,
And angry JOVE an hideous storm of rain
So swiftly pour'd into his lover's lap,
That ev'ry traveller a shelter sought.
Not distant far they spied a shady grove,
Whose lofty trees bedeck'd with Summer's pride
Were spread so broad they hid the light of Heaven,
And shut out ev'ry star:  soon they arriv'd,
And ent'ring in found num'rous winding ways,
With footing worn, and leading inward far:
So on they pass'd, pleas'd with the harmony
Of various birds that shelter'd from the storm,
And seem'd in song to scorn the cruel sky:
Much did they praise the trees so straight and tall,
The sailing pine, the cedar's tow'ring top,
The vine prop'd elm, the poplar never dry,
The builder oak, (the sov'reign of the woods)
The aspine strong, the cypress funeral,
The laurel, (crown of mighty conquerors,
And poets sage) the fir that weepeth still,
The willow worn by disappointed love,
An oft by genius:  the obedient yew,
The birch for shafts, the sallow for the mill,
The myrrhe sweet bleeding in the bitter wound,
The warlike beach, the ash for nought unfit,
The fruitful olive and the round plantain,
The carver holme, the  maple seldom sound;
Delighted thus they still beguil'd their way
Until the storm was o'er, then sought return,
But sought in vain, so num'rous were the paths,
At length amidst the woods most deep recess
A cave they spy'd, 'twas ERROR'S hateful den,
Which well the lady knew, and to avoid
Advis'd the knight, but he unaw'd reply'd,
Eternal shame I ever should deserve
Now to recede, VIRTUE has light within,
Sufficient to illume her guiltless breast,
Amidst the thickest darkness VICE can form,
Then enter'd in with haste, his shining armour
Caus'd a small glimm'ring light, much like a shade,
By which he saw the ugly Monster plain,
Half like a serpent, half of woman's Shape
Most loathsome to behold:  outstretch'd she lay,
Her huge long tail with many knots upwound
O'erspread the den, pointed with mortal sting:
Upon her breasts a thousand young she bore
Whom she sustain'd each day, various their shapes,
Yet each appear'd most horrid to the view.
Soon as th' unusual light upon them shone
They crept into her mouth and kennel'd there:
At sight of human form their dam rush'd forth
Curling her hideous tail around her head,
But swift recoil'd for she could ne'er endure 
The smallest gleam of light, which when he saw
He flew as lions on their fearful prey,
Nor suffer'd her retreat:  then much incens'd
She roar'd so loud, that all the gloomy cave
Resounded horrible:  and turning fierce,
Advanc'd her speckled tail, threat'ning her sting:
But he all undismay'd up-rais'd his hand
And from her head unto her shoulders glanc'd:
At which inrag'd, she leap'd upon his shield
And curl'd her train around him many a fold;
Now when his lady; saw, she pitying said 
Soon will your fortitude and grace be prov'd,
Add faith to force and be not ought afraid:
He heard, and all on fire to be unloos'd,
Exerting all his might be seiz'd her throat,
And caus'd her soon to quit her devilish hold.
Then from her filthy mouth such poison ran,
Whole floods of nauseous books and papers vile,
With loathsome frogs and toads, all wanting eyes,
Which forc'd him back, nor could he longer fight;
Chear'd with success (such chear us can arise
In spirits debas'd) she pour'd forth her spawn,
Like living creatures on the banks of Nile;
These clung around the knight, but hurt him not,
No more than cum'brous gnats annoy the swain
Who marks his num'rous flocks at even-tide,
When ruddy PHOEBUS 'gins to set in West,
For soon with clownish hands he strikes them off
Marring their murmurs.  So this virtuous knight
Treated the monsters that from ERROR sprang,
And her he smote with more than manly force
(So GOD him aided) that her head straight fell
From off her wicked corse, from whence black blood
Distain'd the ground; her scatter'd brood stood round;
And sought their wonted entrance, that deny'd
They suck'd her blood and thence receiv'd new strength;
New strength it seem'd, but death it prov'd, to all.
This virtuous pair then took their lonely way,
Thro' num'rous paths that almost endless seem'd;
At last the chearful rays of light appear'd
And their glad eyes rehail'd the splendid sun,
Engag'd in fit discourse, they journey'd on
And as they went they met a rev'rend man;
His feet all hare, his head all hoary grey,
In sober sadness low he bent his eyes,
Nor ought malicious seem'd:  and praying walk'd,
To whom the the Knight, when salutations o'er,
Know you of ought that seeks a quick redress?
Then thus he answerer'd, how can ancient man
That all day tells his beads, and fits his soul
For future scenes, know what afflicts the world?
Yet can I tell yon of a wicked man
Who wastes the country in a desert wild,
Far hence he dwells secure; haste then reply'd
The valorous man, but she his better guide
Intreated him to rest, tarry all night
She said, and on the morrow you shall pass,
Even the Sun that measures Heav'n all day
At night sets up his steeds among the waves.
So by the godly man's advice they went
To his low cottage, far from mortal foot,
Down in a dale, hard by a forest's side,
A little distant stood the holy house
Where he was wont to pray at morn and eve,
A crystal fountain innocently play'd
And seem'd to sooth the weary'd travellers,
Rest was their feast, and all things at their will,
The noblest mind the best contentment has:
In fair discourse the ev'ning slid away,
For the old man of pleasing words had store,
His tongue like glass, of saints and popes he talk'd,
And ave-marias evermore he strew'd:
Then rest they sought, with labor overcome
And the sad drowsy humor fill'd their eyes,
As if the messenger of sleep had thrown
His velvet mantle o'er them; whilst their host
Try'd magic spells to wake black PLUTO'S dame,
And call'd on GORGON, prince of shades and night,
At which Styx flees and bold Cocytus quakes:
Nor did he fear to curse the LORD of LIFE.
Then from the dread deep darkness he invok'd
Legions of spirits, which like little flies
Flutt'ring around him, instant sought his will;
Of these he chose out two, the falsest two,
The one he kept, the other wing'd with speed
He sent thro' yielding air, and thro' the world:
Of waters wide and deep, to MORPHEUS' house;
Within the earth's deep womb where day ne'er comes
His dwelling is, where TETHYS his wet bed
Doth ever wash, and where the moon still steeps
His ever drooping head in silver dew;
Whilst baleful night her sable mantle spreads:
The double gates he found fast lock'd and:  barr'd,
And wakeful dogs before them watching still,
To banish care, that, enemy to; sleep
Deep drown'd in deepest sleep he MORPHEUS finds,
A trickling stream from high rock falling down
And ever drifting rain upon the top.
Mixt with a murm'ring wind like swarming bees
For ever lull'd him; noise ne'er enters there,
But Quiet wrap'd in silence listless lies:
The spirit then in haste his message told,
But his waste words return'd to him in vain
For MORPHEUS slept as if to wake no more.
At last, as one that dreams, whose brain is tost,
He mutter'd softly, till he heard the name
Of HECATE; then his heavy head 'gan quake
And hastily he ask'd, what bus'ness caus'd
Such rude uproar?  then thus the messenger,
He that the stubborn spirits instant tames
By name ARCHIMAGO, has sent me here,
And straight commands a dream that can delude
The sleeper's keenest scent; a dream most fit
To lull the ear of Virtue, and seduce
The cautious pilgrim to the paths of Folly:
The god obey'd, and. straightway call'd a dream
Out of his darksome den, and gave to him:
Immediate then reclin'd his drowsy head,
Sunk as before in ever careless sleep:
Swift to his lord the spirit bore the dream
Upon his little wings, as soars the lark
To meet Heav'n's clearest light:  his guileful lord
Meanwhile with secret charms and hidden wiles
Had made a lady of the other spirit,
Of liquid air so delicately form'd
And lovely to behold, it almost caught
The maker's sense:  so worshippers of old
Ador'd the idol which their hands had made.
This form he clad in white, and a long robe
Of mournful hue he gracefully bestow'd,
Most like to virtuous UNA it appear'd:
Now when the treach'rous dream was to him brought,
He taught the spirit, and the new form'd fair
How to deceive the knight, who slept secure,
No evil fearing, as intending none;
His fancy now disturb'd with wanton dreams,
He thought his lady at his ear complain'd
That false wing'd CUPID had subdu'd her heart,
And made her stubborn virtue almost yield:
And VENUS queen of beauty there appear'd,
And all the Graces sung in softest air
And FLORA crown'd her with an ivy wreath,
Whilst HYMEN ever youthful, danc'd around:
He waking soon as one in great amaze
Saw her whom he esteem'd his sole delight;
Then thus she said, ah!  Sir, my only lord
Shall I accuse the hidden cruel fates
Of highest Heav'n?  or the blind god of love
That thus I tell what else were never known?
How your dear sake forc'd me at first to leave
My father's throne; then as one choak'd with tears
Her speech she stopt, but soon resum'd her plaint;
My weaker years said she intreat your aid,
Let me not die with sorrow thus opprest;
To whom the knight with innocence reply'd,
Why what should now dismay your virtuous mind,
You that was frequent wont to comfort me?
Love of yourself (she said) forbids my peace
And makes me waste the night in fruitless sighs.
Her words awake within his candid breast
A strange suspicion of her virgin truth;
Yet as he knew no ill, he would not spurn
Her seeming love, but sought her to console
By softest words which thus with grace he spoke:
Let not vain fears disturb your wish'd repose,
For be assur'd as life is to my heart
So dear I hold your love, and think myself
Bound to your service by the tenderest ties.
As one not quite content, yet much appeas'd,
Whilst hope fresh dawns upon the troubled mind,
She slid away, as tho' she sought to rest:
Long time he mus'd on this adventure strange,
Much griev'd to think her virtue was so weak:
At length in sleep's soft arms he sunk again.
