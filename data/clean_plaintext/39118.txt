The bulfinch no music can boast,
While wandering the gardens among,
But nature, when freedom is lost,
Endows the poor captive with song.
So, I, ere thy heart could approve,
Regarded not melody's page,
But now I am fetter'd by love,
And with sounds I my anguish assuage.

When I caroll'd of war and of wine,
In hopes to abandon my pain,
Discordance has mark'd every line,
And I've found all my efforts were vain.
'Tis the plaintive alone which can please,
'Tis the plaintive which soothes my fond soul,
Yet often those cordials that ease,
Raise a malady 'bove all control.

The notes of the Lark give me pain,
His music too cheerfully flows,
But the Robin's soft querulous strain
Is in unison still with my woes.
I have heard of the Nightingale's lay,
But his song to the north is unknown,
Ah!  would he but travel this way,
I would listen all night to his moan.

The joyous I cautiously shun,
Their mirth is disgusting to me;
Nay I loathe e'en the glare of the sun,
For it acts on my feelings like glee.
When the mole leaves his darksome retreat,
When the urchin is seeking for prey,
When the poor harass'd hare quits her seat,
O'er the moorlands by moonlight I stray.

When I dream of my love, and awake,
Tho' disdain had appear'd in her eye,
Chagrin'd, every method I take
The delusion again to enjoy.
Oh Lucy!  attend to the strain
Of one who but feebly can sue,
Oh Lucy!  reject not a swain
Who loves with a passion so true.
