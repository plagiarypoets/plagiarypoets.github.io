Here rests from song and bacchanalian mirth,
A wag, to music, glee, and song well known,
Apollo frown'd not on his humble birth,
And rosy Bacchus mark'd him for his own.

True to that god, sincere as to his lass,
The god an ample recompense did send;&mdash;
He gave the minstrel all he had &mdash; a glass;
'Twas all he wish'd &mdash; 'twas dearer than a friend.

But of his failings here no more disclose,
He had his virtues, let them step between,
And say, "Poor Charley!  sleep in soft repose,
'Till Nature's God shall change the gloomy scene."
