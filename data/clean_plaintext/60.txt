Fair Thamis' Stream, that from Lud's stately Town,
Runst, paying Tribute to the Ocean Seas,
Let all thy Nymphs and Syrens of Renown
Be silent, while this Briton Orpheus plays:
Near thy sweet Banks, there lives that sacred Crown,
Whose Hand strows Palm and never-dying Bayes;
Let all at once, with thy soft murmuring soun,
Present her with this worthy Poet's Praise.
For he hath taught high Drifts in Shepherds Weeds,
And deep Conceits now sings in Fairies Deeds.
