JOCK.
Come Jamie lat us gang to yonder dale,
Whare hillocks green steek out the eastern gale.
This blinkan morn &mdash; the fleecie streakit lift,
Presage an end o' boreal blawin' drift.
The singin' birds hae caught the vernal lowe;
And primroses i' gowden clusters grow.

JAMIE.
Bless'd principal!  O Michty power divine!
That busks thae fields &mdash; an' streaks yon lift sae fine.
An' maks cauld winter stentit bounds to ken;
Flowers whan to shed their scent athort the glen;
Buds whan to bloom &mdash; an' cleid the nakit grove;
Birds whan to chirm their dulcet notes of love.

JOCK.
Thae bonny buds 'mang branches keekin' out
Sal in a little turn to mellow fruit.
Thae crusty moths aneath the bark sae blind,
Sal sune hae wings an' mount upo' the wind.
Thae hingin' sprays that bield the mavis' eggs,
Will sune be prappers for its younglin's legs.

JAMIE.
The callous grain now scatter'd owr the clod,
Sal wi' prolific lustre yellow nod:
First burstin' green frae cranies o' the earth
Sal gie ten thousand har'ests their mellow birth.
Yet stupit man!  wham heaven's form'd for praise,
Sic blessin's scarce his orisons can raise.

JOCK.
Flowers springin' frae the wattl'd roots below,
Wi' sweet, innumerous dyes an' lustres grow.
See leaves unfold o' nature's bonny green,
To draw the sap, an' be to fruit a screen;
Else the fierce blaze o' simmer's luntin heat
Was ruin a', an' nature's views defeat.

JAMIE.
Astonishing!  to see the pregnant spring,
Frae winter's bed, sic bonny beauties bring.
A wee while sin' a' was inert an' dead,
Frae the dull meadow to the summit's head.
But twa', three days sin' sunny hours 'gan range,
Now how our senses testify the change.

JOCK.
Already is the sil'er daisie seen
And snawdrops keekin' frae the livid green.
She first begins wi' nature's little gems,
Before she clieds wi' leaves the woodland stems.
Busks the primrose aneath the forrest roots,
An' wi' progressive beauty upward shoots.

JAMIE.
Wafts owr the meadows fair wi' gowden feet
An' strews behind ilk hour some bloomin' sweet.
Nods owr the stream, whare eddies whirl deep
An' paints her Segs, an' maks her willows weep.
Trips frae the plain &mdash; spreads verdure o'er the hill,
An' wreathes the margin o' the lovers rill.

JOCK.
Walks owr the heather's dreary tapit waste,
An' maks it bloom beneath the northern blast.
Givs its empurpl'd dye &mdash; whereon the bee,
With sweets ambrosial laids its little thigh.
Gangs into glens, whare caverns sullen gloom,
An' gies the moss its hoyden colour'd bloom.

JAMIE.
Perfumes the thyme upo' the hillock's brow;
Maks violets wi' unrivalled shine to blow.
Delightfu' flower!  the richest kingly vest,
Is hoyden to the glowin' o' thy breast.
Nature by thee, hath some day sutten down,
An' a' the skill o' her lov'd pencil shown.

JOCK.
Still lat us dander farer up the vale,
An' frae the primrose new delight inhale.
See how it glents aneath the placid ray,
Drinks o' morn beam, an' lustre gies the day.
In vain the maid &mdash; tho' buskt i' Tyrian dye,
Attempts wi' its simplicity to vie.

JAMIE.
Nature to flowers has sic a polish given,
They cannae be out shone wi' less than heaven.
The mair we look unto the flowery race,
Immingled sweets an' beauties on us press.
Whan heaven gae man auld Eden's bonny bower,
Bade plant the grove an' cultivate the flower.

JOCK.
A sweet employ &mdash; for ane wha, inwardly
Contains a spirit' that never is to die.
The Soger's brand but maks a kintry mourn;
Maks widows rife, an' swalls the tragic urn,
An' flowers gay, sparklin', on the glowin plain,
Weep wi' the blood o' mony thousands slain.

JAMIE.
Detested war!  whan sal the time appear
Whan to the plough irons turn'd the hostile spear?
An' men abhorrent spurn at fields o' gore,
Woo rural shades &mdash; an' learn war's bale no more.
But underneath the olive, fig, an' vine
Breath peace to a', and mak the earth divine.

JOCK.
An' 'neath the smile o' some benignant sky
The yeanling kids i' lions dens sal lie;
And that bricht sun, that smil'd owr Eden's day,
See fernziers, babes, wi' savage monsters play;
An' frae the hole whare serpents us'd to sting
Their hands unvenom'd to their bosoms bring.

JAMIE.
Blest times indeed!  cou'd we but live to see
Whan man-like seraph's, singin', wad agree;
An' the dire brand that threats anither's life
Wave owr the rose a peacefu prunning knife.
An' crimson plains &mdash; the grave o' slaughtered files,
Echo sweet peace's gowden featured smiles.

JOCK.
An' lastin as the lict that shines above,
Pure peace, to breath benevolence an' love.
How stupit is't, whan men for sordit gain,
Mak empires mourn their usefu bairnies slain?
To plant a chaplet on a monarch's brow,
Requires green deaths an' bloody streams o' woe.&mdash;

JAMIE.
An' peacefu arts that polish human life
Are smoor'd amid the fierce conflicting strife.
The soul's fine feelin's, sympathetic, mild,
Turn ga,' hate, rancour i' the battle wild.
An' mankind lost to ilka social tie,
'Mid war's rude din wi' fiends-infernal vie.

JOCK.
Nae mair the father, friend, or social see:
Rage fires ilk breast, an' glances frae ilk e'e.
The killer's kill'd &mdash; the heroe pantin' dies
An' 'side his rival blends his agonies.
While thus, to thousan's swall the mangl'd slain
Grief stalks behind, an' howls out owr the plain.

JAMIE.
We'll leave this theme &mdash; an' lat th' ambitious king
Feel a' the plagues o' war's impoison'd sting,
While we upo' this flowery bed will lie,
An' spring's sweet, flowery featur'd face, survey.
How sweet's the windin's o' the rilly flood,
Whan undefil'd wi' dye o' human blood?

JOCK.
Sweetly dejected by that burny's side
The cowslips hing i' melancholy pride;
An' on the out base o' the ruined pile,
Wi' morn's best beam the scentit wa'flowers smile;
The first reminds me of some droopin' maid,
(Forsaken, flichit, by some perjur'd lad,)
Mournin' her hapless fate amid the shade.
The last shows virtue how sublimely fair,
Who 'mid misfortunes wears an heavenly air.

JAMIE.
The snawdrap bloomin' amang frost an' snaw,
I' spite o' vernal blasts that birlin blaw,
Points fortitude:  (tho' even in a flower),
For it can smile amid an adverse shower.
An' why sou'd men, the progeny o' God,
Dejected sink at fortunes gloomiest nod?
God's arm is stronger than a' Adam's line;
(Tho' a' his sons strength did i' ane's combine):
An' weel can mak the warst o' human wae
Quite unexpectit tak its flicht awa.

JOCK.
The falded crocus i' the mornin' air,
Now spreads its bosom to the sun beam fair:
Acquires new charms frae heaven's all potent fire
An' falds its foliage whan his beams retire.
Sae let us gie our heart to the Supreme;
Live by his licht, an' venerate his Name.

JAMIE.
Sweet daffodils that grow i' ilka grove,
An' fa a prey, whare school-boys dandrin' rove;
Owr fond o' shinin' stray on ilka strand,
An' gie their sweets to ilka ruffian hand.
Be cautious maidens, o' the paths you rove
And shun the haunts o' fause illicit love.
Gif lavish o' your sweets, ye'll seldom fail
To be companions unto grief and bale.

JOCK.
But see Narcissus comes wi' sparklin' eye,
An', buskit i' robes o' heaven's ain native dye.
The smile o' innocence sits on her cheek:
An' fair an' mild as ony maiden meek.
But the least stow'r blawn by the breezy air,
Leaves a deep stain upo' her bosom fair.&mdash;
Sae easy, too, virtue may gather wae,
Gif she near vice sou'd tak her devious way.
An' aft th' infamous tongue o' scandal thraws
A stain at her whan there is little cause.
Be cautious then Narcissa, o' your name,
An' tenty watch th' avenues o' good fame.

JAMIE.
Fairest of flowers the lily of the vale;&mdash;
Gies her sweet bosom to the vernal gale.
The sacred pen has celebrate thy fame;
An' i' the grove gi'en thee a lastin' name.
Enrob'd with sweet &mdash; yet cares nae to be seen,&mdash;
But veils thy excellence 'mong foliage green.
Sae sacred worth walks 'neath a humble screen;
An' unto God its value's only seen.
Loveliest of plants!  nane but the prying e'e
&mdash;Tenth o' thy lowly dignity can see.
Lovers o' glare aft tent the sun-flower's head,
Whyle tramplin' on thy excellence an' meede.
Sae aft exteriors cleek th' untentin een,
Whyle lowly merit needs a search ere seen.

JOCK.
See tulips shine without the sweets o' smell,
An' only in exteriors do excel.
Lat puft' up beaux gang view their portrait, where,
The tulip glances on the gay parterre.
That flower like them has gaudiness o' form,
But soon owrcoupit by the feeblest storm.
An' tho' it whiles escapes the sullen blast,
It shrinks an' dies by noon's het beams at last.
But manly sauls simplicity caress;
And mak their worth to dignify their dress.

JAMIE.
The hyacinthia, heavenly buskit gem!
When side-lang laid, its sweets are still the same.
An' balmy odours o' this bloomin' flower
Are sweet in exit, as in buddin' hour.
Sae fade the temp'rate and the wise and just,
When that the tombs receive their honour'd dust.
The polyanthus niest wi' glowin' dye,
Flusht wi' the various changin's o' the sky.
The lustre o' the infant streakit morn,
Or the mild gildings e'er eve's brow adorn.
The crimson flush upo' the bride-groom's vest,
Or gayer colours on his consort's breast,
The rain-bow's radiance on the ev'ning cloud,
Are a' sweet plant!  deep paintit on thy bud.

JOCK.
The mignonette sweet humble deckit flower!
How sweet it scents the eve or dawning shower.
An' tho' it boasts nae gaudiness o' show,
Elysian sweets frae its green foliage flow.
How aften hae I in my hours o' glee,
Hung O sweet plant, enraptur'd over thee?
Sic, an' mair grand than ony bard can sing,
Appear the sweets o' wonder-workin' spring.
Come then ye nymphs, come leave the dinsome town,
An', amang flowers an' rural shades sit down.
Come carefu' tent the op'ning o' the buds,
While owr them thrills the music o' the woods.
Come leave the madness o' the masquerade,
Join the smooth warblin's o' the silvan shade:
Let your fair fingers cultivate the flower,
The vernal grove &mdash; the summer shady bower.
What signifies the mid-night mixed scene,
Where soft seduction strives your souls to stain?
The fairest smile that e'er sic follies gae,
Concealt beneath some painfu' stings o' wae.
The partin' curtsey frae the mazy ball
Is often followed wi' remorse an' gall.
An' langours which, sic giddy joys succeed,
Mak the soul dull, an' vapourish the head.
When linnets i' the groves harmonious sing,
And vernal hours a new creation bring,
When Zephyrs fan, an' shed a sweet perfume,
An' azure skies an' fleecy clouds illume,
When limpid streams meandering appear,
An' dewy drops hang on the blossoms clear,
An' lowe of Kine &mdash; the bleatin' o' the hills,
Responsive to the murm'rin' o' the rills,
When rustic swains their guileless notes of love,
An' plaintive strains, re-echo frae the grove,
When milk-maids owr the lang with drawin' vale,
Waft their wild cadence thro' the passin' gale,
When Flora in her ever charmin' dress,
Skips o'er the meads and does her sweets impress,
Whan a' the sweets o' melody an' glee,
Run frae the summit to the level lea.
Leave, leave the town &mdash; its giddy toys forbear,
An' woo the paths where true delights appear.

JAMIE.
We'll cae owr flocks now farer up the height;
Lownd is the wind, the sky is flowin' bright,
An' on the breast o' yon gay sloppin' hill,
We'll loose our scrips an' tak o' meat our fill:
An' whan that summer better cleids the spray,
We'll meet an' hae a crack anither day.
