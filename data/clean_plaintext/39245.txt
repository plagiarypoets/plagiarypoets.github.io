In vain his anxious eye some Cot explores,
As o'er the dreary heath his footsteps wind;
Around his head the ruthless tempest pours,
And fear and anguish press him close behind.

And now a blaze of lightning flashing bright,
Aghast &mdash; he views the awful Gibbet near;
And slowly rising from the neighb'ring height,
The fancied forms of shadowy Ghosts appear.

In airy circles while around they flit,
And with shrill shrieks lament their fatal doom;
Lo!  still Attention on yon hillock sit,
An hollow voice thus issuing from the tomb!

"Ye thoughtless Many, who from earliest youth
The wayward paths of vice and folly tread,
Hear from the Grave the sacred voice of Truth,
Nor scorn instruction from the Unhappy Dead."

This barren spot, where legal victims lie,
With speed you pass, as groundless fears impel;
Yet here Reflection with the thoughtful eye,
And melancholy Musing love to dwell.

Here with swoln heart the pensive mourner views
Th' uncoffin'd victims in their cells beneath;
Each varied scene while memory pursues
From life's fair morning to the tree of death.

Haply on these has some fond parent smil'd,
And as he view'd with joy the blessing giv'n,
Has pray'd th' Eternal, "O protect my child,
And grant him virtue, happiness, and Heaven!"

For these, with sleepless eye and anxious breast,
Has some fond mother nightly vigils kept;
And as she lull'd her infant charge to rest,
Has smil'd with transport, and with transport wept!

The harmless prattle of their lisping tongues
With ears enraptur'd have their parents heard:
Dissolv'd, in tenderness have o'er them hung,
And fancied plans of future fame uprear'd.

Delusive fabric!  on a base how frail
Each flat'ring hope of human bliss is built!
Soon the young blossoms feel the noxious gale,
By which example taints the soul with guilt.
