Far from the madding Tumults of the Town,
Which where bright Thought should reign usurp the Seat;
Far from those Tempests which Reflection drown,
I seek with breathless Haste a calm Retreat:

There on some moss-grown Bank supinely laid,
Where close-entwining Boughs exclude the Day;
Save when by quick short Fits amid the Glade,
Sol feebly darts a breeze-conducted Ray;

Or when the Silver-mantled Queen of Night,
In silent Pomp leads forth her shining Train;
When fancy'd Spectres Guilt-struck Minds affright,
Then wakeful stretch'd along the desert Plain;

Thee, lonely Contemplation!  to enjoy,
To whom fair Science owes her humble Birth;
Thy heav'nly Sweets to taste, which ne'er can cloy,
And Rapture-borne range far above the Earth&mdash;

Now the hoarse Murmurs of the distant Throng
Subsiding, faintly strike the vacant Ear;
And that rude Din which erst impell'd so strong,
Now scarcely undulates the whisp'ring Air:

Here let me rest &mdash; Hence view with Thought serene,
Those Realms of wretched Grandeur, glitt'ring Woe;
&mdash;A sable Cloud o'erhangs the giddy Scene,
And sheds dark Influence on each Mind below:

But see &mdash; pure Glory streams along the Plain,
From yon blest Pile, which Virtue's Hand did raise;
Where Charity extends her welcome Reign,
And Innocence her tender Rule obeys:

From Cruelty's ensanguin'd Jaw secure,
Whose Rage, too oft, Necessity commands;
There rest the helpless Offspring of the Poor;
Thence lift to Heav'n their Aid-imploring Hands:

Snatch'd from the Source whence their Existence rose,
(Links broke abrupt from Nature's lengthen'd Chain)
Like tender Saplings which some Tempest blows,
Torn from their Oak, and scatters o'er the Plain.

Till on the Zephyrs friendly Bosom borne,
Into some shelter'd Corner of the Grove;
Where taking Root they soon forget to mourn,
And seem to burst with Gratitude and Love.

The doting Fondness of a Mother's Heart,
That anxious Love which fills a Father's Breast,
To these their lenient Balm did ne'er impart,
Ne'er hush'd their infant Sorrows into Rest;

No Friend their dubious riper Steps to guide,
Thro' Care's dark Gloom, or Pleasure's flow'ry Maze,
No partial Hand their youthful Faults to hide,
Or Merit's budding Shoot indulgent raise:

The Spurns of Insolence, the Mocks of Scorn,
The supercilious Frown of cold Disdain,
The wanton Pow'r of Baseness nobly born,
Doom'd, weak, forlorn, defenceless, to sustain.

But let not Fortune's favour'd Sons despise
Their scanty Portion, dealt by niggard Fate;
O'er Halycon Seas oft sudden Storms arise:
Pearls (once but Drops) now deck the Pomp of State:

Tho' their fond Bosoms never knew the Joys,
Which from a Parent's soft Endearments flow,
Their tranquil Hours no tort'ring Grief annoys,
Strangers alike to deep-imprinted Woe.

(Yet now and then (I ween) a rising Sigh
Obeys instinctive, Nature's secret Call;
And from each pensive, yet untroubled Eye,
Spontaneous Tears, involuntary fall.)

Debarr'd, unknown untasted Bliss, the Mind
Ne'er mourns; 'tis some lov'd Loss gives Sorrow Weight:
Comfort still follows, fraught with Sweets, behind,
And qualifies each bitter Draught of Fate:

Haply, some gen'rous Patron each may claim,
Well pleas'd the Sparks of inborn Fire to fan,
To kindle glowing Genius into Flame,
And raise the Child by Wisdom's Scale, to Man:

Whose useful Lessons, while the Lad receives,
His grateful Mind a noble Ardour fires,
With Transport his enraptur'd Bosom heaves,
And Love ineffable his Soul inspires.

Nature can ne'er in dull Stagnation sleep,
Her active Springs still force resistless Way;
And tho' awhile obscure, they darkling creep,
The rise at last and brighten into Day.

That Love refin'd, whose genial Current feeds
Th' extensive Ocean of parental Care,
From it's due Channel turn'd, it's Bounds exceeds;
And tow'rds each Friend o'erflows the Father's Share.
