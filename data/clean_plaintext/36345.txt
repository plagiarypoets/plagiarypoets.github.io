I gaze upon thee &mdash; yet I will not weep&mdash;
Though to my lips this heart tumultuous swell&mdash;
My soul calls Freedom from her silent sleep,
Then wildly breathes that last, lone word &mdash; Farewell!
Why doth the music of the sweet-toned shell
Break into sadness?  now those soft notes flying
Light as the musical airs &mdash; now Freedom's knell
Upon the desolate winds abruptly sighing&mdash;
Like Ocean's whisp'ring gale, which seems most sweet when dying!

Oh!  lead me to blest Liberty's lone grave!&mdash;
There will I stand, and hear the waters lash
Her sacred tomb &mdash; the wildly musical wave
May scornfully upon the cold stone dash!
Yes!  let seas rage, and angry lightnings flash!
Land of the Muses, and of liberty!
Once it was thine to bid kings bow, worlds crash!
Oh!  once 'twas THINE, immortal Greece, to be
The conqueror of the world &mdash; the parent of the free!

And this is desolation! &mdash; this is death!&mdash;
This is the gloomy stillness of the soul!&mdash;
Within this chaos doth no spirit breath?&mdash;
Doth no soft voice upon the loud seas roll,
Wild as thy winds, and free from man's controul?&mdash;
Heard faintly, but mysterious, and unseen&mdash;
A sad tone issuing from destruction's goal,
And gently breathing 'neath that blue serene
A sigh for what will be &mdash; what IS and what HAS BEEN?

Then farewell Athens!  Oh, farewell, farewell!
Land of the glorious &mdash; nation of the free!
Oh!  do my senses labour 'neath a spell,
Gazing on THIS &mdash; which breathes of thine, and thee,
City of heroes? &mdash; Orphan'd liberty,
Invisible, may even now be near,
And bending from her kindred  skies, may be
Gazing, in silent madness, mutely HERE&mdash;
And mingling with a smile the sweetness of a tear!
