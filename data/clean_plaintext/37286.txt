I lay upon a bank with harebells strown;
For now the ruddy Sun was growing pale,
And here and there a star was glittering lone,
And rich with odours from the blossomed vale
Came slowly as a sigh the evening gale.
Then all was hush'd &mdash; but where with folded wing
Above me cooed the turtle-dove her tale,
And, thro' the grass, a little bubbling spring
Wooed gentle Summer-sleep with its low murmuring.

But whether that sweet spot was haunted ground,
Or that the world-sick fancy loves to stray
Thro' regions on our weary Earth unfold,
No sooner sleep upon my eyelids lay,
Than seemed to light the East a lovelier day;
And, lo!  upon the dappled clouds afar
Came winged and rose-wreathed forms, that with fond play
Danced round and round a slow descending car,
From which a radiance shone, richer than Sun or Star.

And from it stooped upon the flowery bank
Three shapes of beauty; yet they wore no plume,
In reverend worship at their feet I sank:
"We come," said they, and Echo said "We come,"
In sounds that o'er me hovered like perfume.
"We come, The GRACES three!  to teach the spell,
That makes a sweet woman lovelier than her bloom."
Then rose a heavenly chant of voice and shell:
"Let Wit!  and Wisdom!  with her sovereign beauty dwell!"
