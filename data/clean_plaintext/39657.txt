Hark!  mid the howlings of the wintry blast
A warning voice is heard, whose solemn tone
Reminds us that another year is past
With all its pleasures and its follies, gone,
Irrevocably fled, whilst borne upon
Its flagging wing, down dark Oblivion's stream
Thoughts, words, and actions float, of which not one
Shall be remembered, save with fitful gleam,
Like horrid phantasms of the sick man's troubled dream.

Where are they all, the talented, the gay,
The fair, the brave, who, when the year was young,
Exulting gladly in Life's early day,
To Pleasure's lyre the merry carol sung;
And while each ear with the sweet harpings rung,
Each eye with joy's bright glances shone unfeigned,
Around each brow the rosy chaplet hung,
In each glad heart mirth in full joyance reigned,
And burst from every tongue rejoicings unrestrained.

Thy days rolled on &mdash; in sunshine and in cloud,
In storm and calm alternate, thou hast known
A change of times and persons; &mdash; far and loud
The piercing cry of agony &mdash; the groan
Of destitution &mdash; and the wailing moan
Of widows and of orphans have been spread&mdash;
In thy dark train want, misery, Death have gone,
And the chilled Earth shrank loathing from their tread,
Till from the prospect sad e'en Hope had well-nigh fled.

Thy weeks are fled &mdash; nor can I sorrow much
That thou art gone, for soothly thou hast been
A year of dangers and of perils, such
As few or none of mortal tribe I ween
Had e'er in saddest musings thought to have seen;
Yet are thy shadowings past; &mdash; and thus like thee
Shall darkest clouds which haply intervene
Before the fairest prospects, timely flee,
And brighter scenes shall rise of glad Prosperity.

On the great ocean of commercial faith
How many a gallant vessel, which be-decked
In gayest trim, and with the splendid wreath
Of pleasure's wavering adornment flecked,
Set out upon her voyage, and little recked
Of shoal, or treacherous sand, or hidden rock,
Was in that dread convulsion buried, wrecked
Beneath the horrors of the sweeping shock,
And made of knaves and fools alike the sport and mock.

It was a dreadful, overwhelming stroke&mdash;
Yet our loved England nobly met the blow
Which struck thus at her vitals, and bespoke
The coming of a darker, mightier woe,
A providence mysterious, which should throw
Terror around her proudest
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

The storm has passed &mdash; though in its wild career
Reckless, remorseless, as it swept along,
There was no ray of light the gloom to cheer,
Which like a heavy cloud around thee hung,
Still thou wast Britain, and around thee clung
For help and strength the hopes of half a world,&mdash;
And I would praise thee in my humble song,
Where'er thine ire has been in thunder hurled,
Where'er in peaceful guise thy flag has been unfurled.

Yes, I do love thee, Britain, and though far
From thee my days of youth-hood must be spent,
In other climes, where yonder western star
Shines o'er the burning shores to which is bent
My way-ward course, yet while to me are lent
The powers of recollection &mdash; yes, until
Sense, Memory, Reason from their thrones are rent,
In prosperous or in troublous hours I will
Love thee &mdash; thou wast my pride, and thou shalt be so still.
