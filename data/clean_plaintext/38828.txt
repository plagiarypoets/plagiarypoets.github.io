Deep in a dark recess, where waters black
In current listless move, there dwells Despair,
Her wings all pond'rous, and each motion slack;
Her bosom dank, heaving with stagnant air:

Affright and horrour shake her palsey'd mind,
Her hope forlorn, if hope that may be called,
Which, good in expectation none can find,
And at each future prospect is appalled.

Her guests no comfort know, but ever feed
On tainted viands, tainted all with grief;
With anguish fell, the sad but frequent meed
Of Virtue perished beyond relief.

Then come not near this desolated cell,
Let Innocence and Virtue be thy stay;
Let Hope's bright glowing ray all gloom dispel,
That Hope whose bounds are unremitting day.
