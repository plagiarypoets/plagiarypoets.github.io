Come, heav'nly thought, in calm devotion drest,
Hallow the sabbath of Jehovah's praise,
Pure, and by worldly passion unperplext,
Begirt with sanctity and christian grace,
Hymning hosannahs to creation's Lord,
By downcast mien of angels, reverenc'd and ador'd!

Pride bending under reason's firm constraint
Bow lowly.  Father of what's holiest, best
Source of whatever borders on the saint,
Thyself in thy son's pattern best exprest;
Before whom virtue is not free from stains,
Wisdom is folly, human strength incompetence.

My soul's best organs fail to reach thy height,
And thought extended can't that goodness scan,
That scorns iniquity with perfect hate,
Prompting virtue mark'd by man's disdain,
By scorn endur'd illustrating thy praise,
For thou her blots incurr'd in judgment shalt craze.

Arm'd with such virtue, my lov'd Saviour brav'd
Each vilifying taunt of human dross,
Insulted by their scorn his virtues sav'd
By meritorious suff'ring of the cross;
Each stigma plants a jewel in his crown
Of glory, and decrees a pang to foes o'erthrown.
