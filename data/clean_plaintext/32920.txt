Even at the Joyous entrie gate amazement yet,
Arrests his foote, and forst him pay the eye his debt,
Who this modell of beautie curiously survaide,
Where nature all her art, art her wit displaide.
But neither can I tell, ne can I stay to tell,
This pallace architecture, where perfections dwell:
Who list such know, let him Muses despencier reede,
Or thee, whom England sole did since the conquest breed,
To conquer ignorance, Sidney like whom endite,
Even Plato would, or Jove (they say) like Plato write:
Her sunne bright lustre dazled so his gazing eye,
That it must other sences crave in ayde, to trye
Where she a living wight, or marble Image were:
What dost thou Aolus?  to what end cam'st thou there?
Now, or never, and never but now take thy hap,
And ever if now, Love will dandle thee in lap. . . .
