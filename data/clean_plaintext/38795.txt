Go, FLOWER, shew my LOVE I fear'd
A stem like thine could ne'er restrain,
Singly, so weak, so unprepar'd,
The driving wind, the beating rain:
And say, that hence a stronger reed
I stationed at thy friendless side,
A guardian band round each convey'd,
And both in happy union ty'd:
That wedded thus, safe could thy gentle form
Pour forth its op'ning sweets, and mock the coming storm.

Thus, sweet Ambassadress, from me,
Thus, beauteous Flower, bespeak the fair,
And if she should the moral see,
&mdash;For more is meant than meets the ear&mdash;
And if thou mark a truant smile
Quick o'er her brightening features fly;
And if a vivid gleam the while
Fire the blue lustre of her eye,
Ah then, thou loveliest Flower!  kind, faithful be,
And bear one fond, one warm, one trembling vow from me!
