What John?  What Gower?  John Gower, Chaucers friend?
He liv'd; and wrote renow'd in times of yore:
And now belike, according to the lore
Of great Pythagoras, himselfe doth lend.

Thus, by Soule-shifting, Virgil's ghost did wend
To Spencer's lodge.  Who Ovid was before;
Is Drayton since.  Thus Lucan Fates restore
In May.  Thus Orpheus soule doth Quarl's attend.

Let Heralds thee engower when thou wilt brave it:
Thy Muse for name; and fame makes Affidavis.
