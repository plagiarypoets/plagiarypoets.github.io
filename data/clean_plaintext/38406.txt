Hush'd is the raving of the subject main,
Rude Boreas yields to Zephyrus his sway,
While, gliding onwards through the liquid plain,
Britannia's Monarch urges on his way&mdash;
He whom the happiest isles of earth obey,
On ocean direful as on land sublime,
Glory around his standard seems to play,
His pendant points to Britain, happy clime,
And bids her history give the sight to latest time;

Bids her record, on adamantine page,
The glorious deed that still shall grace his brow;
How, fir'd with all the patriot's noblest rage,
Too tardy for his wishes moves the prow,
(To which the waves in due submission bow,)
A gallant nation to embrace and free,
To rout oppression and alleviate woe,
While Peace, his herald, sounds the blest decree,
Slavery no longer lives &mdash; rise, sons of liberty!

The rocks of Mona hear the glorious sound,
The sea-beat coast reverberates the strain,
Till lofty Snowdon's cliffs with joy rebound,
And Penmanmaur re-echoes it again,
The em'lous Tritons of old Neptune's reign,
Convey the sounds till Wicklow mountains ring,
And tongues of millions on Clontauf's sweet plain,
The anthem due to goodness humbly sing&mdash;
Great God of mercy bless long-injur'd Erin's King.

Glorious his arms &mdash; speak Waterloo and Nile
Tagus, Trafalgar, ye can bear record&mdash;
The names are dear to all time emerald isle;
Sweet to her eyes the banners of her lord&mdash;
The elements and men with heaven accord,
To gratulate and guide him on Love's wing.
Favour him, heaven!  See thou his squadron moor'd.
The praise be thine, who didst our Monarch bring.
Glory to God on high!  Joy comes with Erin's King!
