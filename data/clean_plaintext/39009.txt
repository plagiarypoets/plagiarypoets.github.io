The lark carols high on the morn;
The mountain ash waves in the breeze;
Fair Summer revisits the lawn&mdash;
But I have no pleasure in these:

The Sun's peeping far in the East;
The rivulet winds thro' the glen;
The owlet's dull hooting has ceas'd;
And the wood-nymphs are sporting again:

But the rivulet sprinkles for thee
A freshness which I cannot share;
And what are the wood-nymphs to me,
Who lament that my Jenny's not here?

I care not a whit for the beam
That chases the orient dew;
It may gild both the forest and stream,
And delight such a lover as you.

Yet oh &mdash; if my Jenny were here,
To admire the lark's early song,
I would follow his flight thro' the air,
And intreat him the strain to prolong.

The lawn's fairest flower I'd raise
To repose on the breast of my love,
And to Echo would babble her praise,
Who should tell it again to the grove.

She comes &mdash; and the moss-rose appears
More sweet as she passes the plain;
Tho' its bosom is moisten'd with tears,
It seems to be smiling again:&mdash;

Ah, no &mdash; 'tisn't she &mdash; in its birth
Thus again hath my happiness flown,&mdash;
Oh, Corydon, stifle your mirth,
Or leave me to wander alone.
