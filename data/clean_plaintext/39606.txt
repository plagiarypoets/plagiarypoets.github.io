The pageantry of courts, the pomp of kings,
And all the world calls wealthy, great, and fair,
I scorn, but chiefly those ignoble things
Who breathe in base subservience courtly air;
Who fawn, and kneel, and creep, and laugh, and cry,
As wills the prince his pleasure to declare:
Out!  out!  ye sycophants, begone, fly!  fly!
Ye bear no image of the Deity.

I come not here in falsehood's hollow train,
To pamper courtly luxury and pride,
With polished compliments to wake the strain,
And praise a mortal whom the good deride:
Far other duties on the Laureate fall,
To censure, where all decency's defied;
To preach of temperance at virtue's call,
And to their proper selves the wandering senses call!
