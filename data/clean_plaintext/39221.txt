See!  see! from the east how the god of the day
All rosy brings on the new morn;
How the dew-drops hang pendent from every spray,
And the songsters enliven the thorn;
Not a violet, a harebell, or sweet-flavour'd rose,
Or aught of the daisied lawn,
Not a soft sighing zephyr, or streamlet that flows,
But smiles at the blush of the dawn.

From the heath-cover'd hills are the shadows dispell'd,
And the vapours exhal'd from the glade;
The pale glimm'ring moon by the sun is excell'd,
And Aurora revisits the shade:
The drowsy god Morpheus, oblig'd to retire,
Gives to shepherds the sweets of the morn;
While the skies to the eastward appear as the fire,
And nature as recently torn.

In the cottage recluse, where good harmony dwells,
The ploughman awakes with the sun,
And hies him, contented, o'er uplands and dells,
To finish his labours begun:
The milk-maid, enamour'd of pastoral life,
Repairs to her task on the hill;
Her ambition but asks to be Corydon's wife,
Or Patie's who lives in the mill.

Come then, my Alexis, away let us rove,
The sweets of the morn to partake;
To the god of the seasons, in anthems of love,
Let our matins extatic awake:
Creation rejoices &mdash; The birds from each tree
Invite us to join in the lay;
Why then to their Maker should rationals be
More proud or ungrateful than they?
