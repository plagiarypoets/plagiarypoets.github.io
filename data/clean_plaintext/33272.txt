A MASKE.
CUPID DESCENDS, THE GRACES SITTING BY HIM, CUPID BEING BOUND THE GRACES UNBIND HIM; HE SPEAKS.

CUPID.
Unbinde me, my delight, this night is mine,
Now let me looke upon what Stars here shine,
Let me behold the beauties, then clap high
My cullor'd wings, proud of my Deity;
I am satisfied, binde me agen, and fast,
My angry Bow will make too great a waste
Of beauty else, now call my Maskers in,
Call with a Song, and let the sports begin;
Call all my servants the effects of love,
And to a measure let them nobly move.
Come you servants of proud love,
Come away:
Fairely, nobly, gently move,
Too long, too long you make us stay;
Fancy, Desire, Delight, Hope, Feare,
Distrust and Jealousie, be you too here;
Consuming Care, and raging Ire,
And Poverty in poore attire,
March fairely in, and last Despaire;
Now full Musick strike the Aire.

ENTER THE MASKERS, FANCY, DESIRE, DELIGHT, HOPE, FEARE, DISTRUST, JEALOUSIE, CARE, IRE, DESPAIRE; THEY DANCE, AFTER WHICH CUPID SPEAKES.

CUPID.
Away, I have done, the day begins to light,
Lovers, you know your fate, good night, good night.

CUPID AND THE GRACES ASCEND IN THE CHARIOT.
