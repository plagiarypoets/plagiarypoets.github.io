Not all, that sit beneath a golden roof,
In rooms of cedar, O renowned Lord,
Wise though they be, and put to highest proof,
To the sweet Muses do their grace afford;
Which if they did, the like would them accord
The mighty poets to eternity,
And their wise acts in living verse record,
And build them up, great heirs of memory,
Which else shall in oblivion fall and die;
But Thou, that like the Sun, with heavenly beams
Shining on all, dost cheer abundantly
The learned hands, that drink Castalian streams;
Transcendent Lord, accept this verse from me,
Made for all time, but yet unfit for thee.
