Ah!  what avail the largest gifts of Heaven,
When drooping health and spirits go amiss?
How tasteless then whatever can be given!
Health is the vital principle of bliss,
And exercise of health!  In proof of this,
Behold the wretch, who slugs his life away,
Soon swallow'd in disease's dark abyss;
While he whom toil has brac'd, or manly play,
Has light as air each limb, each thought as clear as day.

O who can speak the vigorous joys of health?
Unclogg'd the body, unobscur'd the mind;
The morning rises gay; with pleasing stealth,
The temperate evening falls serene and kind.
In health the wiser brutes true gladness, find;
See!  how the younglings frisk along the meads,
As May comes on, and wakes the balmy wind;
Rampant with life, their joy all joy exceeds?
Yet what but high strung health this dancing pleasaunce breeds?

It was not by vile loitering in ease
That Greece obtain'd the brightest palm of art,
That soft yet ardent Athens learnt to please,
To point the wit, and to sublime the heart!
In all supreme!  complete in every part!
It was not thence majestic Rome arose,
And o'er the nations shook her conquering dart,
For sluggard's brow the laurel never grows!
Renown is not the child of indolent repose.

Had listless mortals paid regard to nought
But in loose joy their time to wear away;
Had they alone the lap of dalliance sought,
Pleas'd on her pillow their dull heads to lay,
Rude nature's state had been our state to day;
No cities o'er their towery fronts had rais'd,
No arts had made us opulent and gay;
With brother brutes, the human race had grazed,
None e'er had soared to fame, none honor'd been, none praised.
