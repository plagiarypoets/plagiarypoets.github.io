Fam'd hill, that, as Tradition tells, wouldst show
To lonely Merlin, hence around display'd,
Those varied beauties; mountains with their shade,
Far reaching, and meandering streams below;
Thou, to whose summit, Fate's decrees to know,
Ere Love his footsteps to the lake convey'd,
High chiefs, 'tis sung, their eager journies made,
Now on such godlike gifts none faith bestow.
Yet though my country, for a thousand years,
Were taught its doom, what warning more desired,
Or truer, could from hallow'd caverns sound,
Than this, "unfriended by his faithless fears,
Baseness shall rue the boon his prayers acquired,
And Valour be, alone, by fortune crown'd?"
