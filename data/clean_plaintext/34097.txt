On a wild Heath long stood a sturdy Oak,
Expos'd to raging Winds, and Thunder's stroke;
Much Damage this from adverse Skies had born;
Its Verdure blasted, and its Branches torn;
Yet, was it not so much by Ills consum'd,
But that in Part, it flourish'd still, and bloom'd.

Here chearful Birds a free Reception found,
Diffusing hence a choice harmonious Sound;
Here, grazing Cattle often, Tempest-driv'n,
Had Shelter from th' Inclemency of Heav'n;
And here cou'd resting Passengers allay
Their Journey's Toil, and Rigour of the Day:

Hard by a Myrtle, pleasing to the View,
Arose, and quickly to Perfection grew;
This feeble Plant, in Youth's and Beauty's Pride,
(As yet by any adverse Ills untry'd)
It self regarding, scorn'd the gen'rous Oak,
And pertly thus, and arrogantly spoke.

"Art thou, whom Mortals stil'd the Choice of Jove!
Grace of the Plain, and Monarch of the Grove!
How art thou, falsely venerable Tree!
In sweet and blooming Grace surpass'd by me?
When Men (thus prone to gross Mistakes) compare
Our Glories, as they here apparent are,
Thy long-held Honour thou shall'st soon resign,
And all thy vast Preheminence be mine."

Thus the low gaudy Shrub, elate with Pride,
Presum'd, and thus the Reverend Oak reply'd.

"What Good can any of the living Kind,
What Use of thee, thou poor Pretender!  find?
Thou can'st, at most, but yield a vain Delight,
But slightly gratify the Smell and Sight;
Thy blooming Grace, that is regarded most,
And where are plac'd thy Confidence and Boast;
How soon wou'd that, and how intirely fly
The bloist'rous Horror of a Winter's Sky!
Nor cou'd by thee thy Glory be secur'd,
At one of all those Ills that I've endur'd."

THE MORAL.
Who Reason or themselves but slightly know,
Suppose all Value is compriz'd in Show;
But real Worth is prov'd and justify'd,
In being fully and severely try'd;
Worst Judges of themselves, of others too,
Are they who never Opposition knew.
