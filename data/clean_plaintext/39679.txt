How oft have I curst in my mind
My wretched deplorable state;
No ease nor contentment I find,
For Chloe's still to me ingrate.

She frowning refuses to hear
The humble request of her swain;
My hope's intercepted with fear,
My kindnesses meet with disdain.

What scenes of unlimited woe
Her cruelty pours on my head!
What pains I for her undergo,
When sorrows encompass my bed!

Each shepherd that pipes on the plain
His Phillis can please and delight;
Attentive she hears his soft strain;
But Chloe poor Strephon does slight.

My flame it was ardent and just;
My bosom with tenderness glow'd;
My heart the sincerest, I trust,
That e'er was on mortal bestow'd.

But since that my Chloe's unkind,
Adieu to the charms of the fair;
Some place I'll endeavour to find,
To breathe out my sorrow and care.

No more will I frolic and rant,
But pensive I'll be as the dove;
No more shall the music enchant
My soul with the raptures of love.

Ye banquets of pleasure adieu!
No more will I taste of your cheer;
But in this deplorable hue
To the shades of oblivion will steer.
