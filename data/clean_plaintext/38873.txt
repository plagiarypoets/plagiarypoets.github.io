Ne wealth had I; ne garland of renown;
Slow pass'd the minutes through the livelong day,
Till from the upland mead, and thistled down,
I watch'd the sun's last lustre steal away.
And if perchance my little heart was gay,
It beat to hear some merry minstrel's note,
Or goat herd, carolling his roundelay
On craggy cliff; while, from the linnet's throat,
Full many a winding hill on airy wings would float.

For oft, upon the brow of mountain steep,
As slow the landscape faded from my view,
With devious step I wander'd far to weep,
While all around the sultry vapours flew,
Heedless of with'ring bolt, or drizzly dew,
And, as the giant shadows vanquish'd day,
Veiling the woodland dell in dusky hue,
By the small tinkling sheep-bell would I stray,
And, like to Elfin ghost, bemoan the hours away.

Or, when the wint'ry moon, with crystal eye,
Above the promontory bleak 'gan sail,
Shrouding her modest brow in amber sky,
While shrill the night-breeze whistl'd o'er the vale;
Oft did I pour my melancholy tale,
By some clear shallow stream, that wander'd slow,
Listless and weary, indolent and pale,
My bosom swelling high with bitter woe;
Which none but luckless wight with tender heart can know.

And oft to other's plaints did I give heed,
For all that griev'd my bosom learnt to sigh;
I could not see the fleecy victim bleed,
Ne snare the freeborn tenant of the sky;
Nor lesser wight should fall when I stood by;
For vile oppression rous'd my little rage;
In combat fierce the younker to defy,
I would with breathless ire my limbs engage,
While neither threats nor pain my anger could assuage.

With ebon locks unkempt and mean attire,
A mountain weather-beaten wight was I;
And passing meek, save when resentful ire
Bade from my glance the living light'nings fly,
To think that vice should virtue's place supply:
For though no classic knowledge grac'd my mind,
From legends old, or feats of chivalry,
Still round my heart, the wond'rous instinct twin'd,
Which throbb'd thro' ev'ry vein, the love of human kind.
