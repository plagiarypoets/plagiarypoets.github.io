Bright was thy short career, ill-fated Bard!
Too bright to last &mdash; martyr of song!  to me
Dear for thy woes; thy comeliness was marr'd
In the worst blight of bitter penury;
And cold neglect came heavily o'er thee,
Shrouding thy soul in phrenzy's darkest gloom!
Shamed be thy leaden townsmen, that could see
Such beauty die, and not revoke the doom&mdash;
They brought thee, child of song!  to this untimely tomb.

Thus, bending o'er thee &mdash; not fate's sternest frown,
Nor fortune's smile could grieve or gladd in me;
Thus, bending o'er thee, I could lay me down,
And weep my soul away, and sleep with thee:
There hovers round, a spell, a witchery,
That more than loveliest scene or loftiest song,
Dissolves the heart to tearful ecstacy
And pleasing sadness:  Poetry more strong
Burns o'er thee dead, than could to living Bard belong.
