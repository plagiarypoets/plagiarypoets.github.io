Thou, that sit'st list'ning on the mountain's peak,
When the shrill lark his twilight matins sings,
And the young rose, from her dew-sprinkled cheek,
O'er Zephyr's couch her freshest fragrance flings;
For thee her lyre the Muse, enraptur'd, strings,
Meek, lovely messenger, of mirth and light!
As down the vale the dull, dun vapour wings,
Silent and slow, its solitary flight,
Following afar the shadowy form of Night,
Till in the western wave her sable train
Dip their dark pinions, and descend from sight,
Shunning the radiance of the rising reign.
How sweet, O Morn!  to taste, and to behold
The feast of beauty now thy scenes unfold!
