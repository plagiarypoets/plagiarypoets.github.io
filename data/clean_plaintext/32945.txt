Beautie sate bathing by a Spring,
Where fayrest shades did hide her.
The winds blew calme, the birds did sing,
The coole streames ranne beside her.
My wanton thoughts entic'd mine eye,
To see what was forbidden:
But better Memory said, fie,
So, vaine Desire was chidden.
Hey nonnie, nonnie, &c.

Into a slumber then I fell,
When fond Imagination:
Seemed to see, but could not tell
Her feature or her fashion.
But even as Babes in dreames doo smile,
And sometime fall a weeping:
So I awakt, as wise this while,
As when I fell a sleeping.
Hey nonnie, nonnie, &c.
