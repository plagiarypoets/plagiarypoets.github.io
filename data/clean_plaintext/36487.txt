Hail modest streamlet!  on whose bank
No willows grow, nor osiers dank;
Whose waters form no stagnant pool,
But ever sparking, pure and cool,
Their snaky channel keep, between
Soft swelling hills of tender green,
That freshens still, as they descend
In gradual slope of graceful bend,
And in the living emerald end&mdash;
On whose soft turf supinely laid
Beneath the spreading beechen shade,
I trace, in Fancy's waking dream,
The current of thine infant stream
Where straggling on with gentle force,
Thy waves pursue their destined course.
