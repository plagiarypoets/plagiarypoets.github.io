His soul was proud:  and feeling caus'd him scath&mdash;
Companions rich and noble he had made!
For princely education got he, 'faith
At schools and college, where to learn he staid
All kinds of knowledge in each tint and shade:
For he that lov'd him in his early years,
And who by destiny was now low laid,
Wish'd his belov'd to be, as it appears,
If not by birth, by talent company for peers.
