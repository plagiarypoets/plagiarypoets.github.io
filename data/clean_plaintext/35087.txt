For noble ancestry renown'd,
Thousands shall in oblivion lie;
Thousands with noisy triumph crown'd,
Unnotic'd by the Muse shall die:
For thee, M&mdash;r, she wakes her living lyre,
Nor suffers worth, like thine, in silence to expire.

O Friend!  O Father!  for that name
May well become thy generous care,
Which far beyond the kindred claim
Stood forth &mdash; and rais'd me from despair:
Then on my infant unform'd mind, first bade
Instruction's copious dews their genial influence shed.

And as I riper years attain'd,
What vig'rous beams thy friendship threw;
Affection not by art maintain'd,
No pride, no caprice, e'er withdrew:
Guide of my life!  blest instrument of heaven!
By whom its boundless love has peace and freedom given.

Thee now triumphant from the tomb,
By Mercy's radiant arms embrac'd;
Thee has thy Maker's gracious doom,
High in supreme salvation plac'd:
Where those bright virtues late our boast below,
Expand in ample shade, and heavenly fruits bestow.

There present to the Omniscient Mind,
Thy mortal works sweet incense rise:
Labours of love and zeal refin'd,
The tears of joy from grateful eyes,
The genuine transports of reliev'd distress,
Bursting in hymns of praise, thy godlike bounty bless.

O from the glories of that place,
With angels in communion blest!
From endless joys a little space,
Attend a once-lov'd friend's request;
To sacred Pity's seat in power sublime,
Where never meek Desire did unaccepted climb.

Be mine to sooth this earthly road,
Thy pure, sequester'd, calm retreat;
The conscious presence of thy God!
Unblemish'd life, and death sedate;
In one short sentence to comprize the whole,
May Heaven transfuse to me the virtues of thy soul.
