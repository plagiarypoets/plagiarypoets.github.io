The guard behind the coach had blown his horn,
The Felons on the roof had clink'd their chains,
When Campbell's guest, herself a Campbell born,
With graceful jirk to mount the ladder deigns.

A Merchant at her side, who dealt in coals,
But now, gazetted, in the Bankrupt line;
Caressing and caress'd she bumps and rolls,
Though Faith and Cotton at their loss repine.

Their dinner, two and sixpence by the head,
A shilling is the lunch, and sixpence tea,
The heart of Griskin for the Felons bled,
Ale was her gift, compassion was her plea.

When at the Borough they at length arriv'd,
Their lingering wheels of Lad pursued the Lane,
There honours crown'd her, there preferments thriv'd,
And Griskin is of Donald's bridal train.
