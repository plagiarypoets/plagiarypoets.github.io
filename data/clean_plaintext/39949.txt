The mother knelt beside her dying son&mdash;
There was no flush upon her cheek &mdash; her eye
With pearly tears was gemm'd not &mdash; in it shone
No furious grief-lit passion to defy
The will of him enthron'd amid the sky.
He was her only son, her last, her best,
On whom she'd lov'd to lean and to rely&mdash;
Her fears were ne'er awaken'd by request
Of him, who would, ere long, be one among the blest.

She knelt beside him, and tho' tears came not,
Deep, madd'ning woe, within that lonely breast
Held sway uncheck'd &mdash; and now and then there shot
From that dark eye, soon to be clos'd in rest,
A ling'ring spark of pity &mdash; 'twas the test!
She, that lone mother, felt it in her woe&mdash;
Her lips refus'd her agoniz'd behest,
And there she knelt, half praying, soon to know
All joy was grief to her, all desolate below.

She rais'd him from his couch, his paly face
Brighten'd a moment with expiring ray;
But soon it fled, and consciousness apace,
The mandate bore its trembling breath away.
Oh!  I have seen the friendless kneel and pray,
An orphan mourn his earthly blessings fled,
The husband weep o'er her who'd been his stay,
But ne'er beheld an agony so dread,
As stiff and speechless lay that widow by the dead.

There is no hope for such &mdash; a friend, tho' dear,
His loss severely felt, may be replac'd;
Life's only joy dies not upon his bier,
Again is seen thy face with smilings grac'd,
Thy sorrows have been soften'd or effac'd;
But she who loses that which she did bear,
That one in whom all joy, all love was plac'd,
Alone and friendless, nourishes her care,
And yields her up, at length, a victim to despair.
