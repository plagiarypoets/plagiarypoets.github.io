Father of Earth and Heaven!  I call thy name;
Round me the smoke and shout of battle roll,
My eyes are dazzled with the rustling flame.
Father!  sustain an untried Soldier's soul!
Or life, or death, whatever be the goal
That crowns or closes round this struggling hour
Thou know'st, if ever from my spirit stole
One deeper pray'r, 'twas that no cloud might low'r
On my young fame, O, hear!  God of Eternal Pow'r,

God!  thou art merciful!  the wintry storm,
The cloud that pours the thunders from its womb,
But shew the sterner grandeur of thy form:
The lightnings, glancing thro' the midnight gloom,
To Faith's rais'd eye as calm, as lovely come
As splendours of the autumnal Evening's Star,
As roses shaken by the breezes plume,
When like cool incense combs the dewy air,
And on the golden wave, the sunset flames afar.

GOD!  thou art mighty!  at thy footstool bound,
Lie prostrate, Chance and Fate, and Life and Death!
Nor in the Angel circle flaming round,
Nor in the million worlds that sweep beneath,
Is one that can withstand thy wrath's hot breath!
Woe in thy frown!  in thy smile Victory!
Hear but my prayer!  I ask no mortal wreath;
Let but these eyes my rescued country see,
Then take my spirit all, Omnipotent, to thee!

Now, for the fight &mdash; now, for the cannon peal!
All round me blood and toil and cloud and fire;
Glorious the shout, the shock, the crash of steel,
The musket roll, the rockets' blasting spire;
They shake, like broken waves their squares retire.
Hussars!  now, slack the rein, now give the heel,
Think of the insulted wife, the murder'd sire,
On, comrades, on; in thunder on them wheel;
This hour to Europe's fate shall set the triumph-seal.
