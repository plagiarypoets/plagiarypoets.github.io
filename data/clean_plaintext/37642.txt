The steepie clifftes of Chalmas hallie (h) grounde.

II.  CHATTERTON UNMASKED.
ECLOGUE THE FIRST.
[From Rowley's Poems, quarto, p. 391.]

When England smoking from her deadly wound,
From her gall'd neck did twitch the chain away,
Seeing her lawfull sons fall all around,
(Mighty they fell, 'twas Honour led the fray,)
Then in a dale, by eve's dark surcoat gray,
Two lonely shepherds did abruptly fly,
(The rustling leaf does their white hearts affray,)
And with the owlet trembled and did cry:
First Robert Neatherd his sore bosom struck,
Then fell upon the ground, and thus he spoke.
