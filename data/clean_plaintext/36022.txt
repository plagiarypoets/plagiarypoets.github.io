Whate'er thy name, these pages bland inditing,
To raise and to adorn the female mind
With all the nameless charms of beauteous writing,
And make it the delight of human kind,
This tributary lay, tho' unrefin'd,
Deign to accept from one, who, pondering well,
Nor to thy merit nor thy genius blind,
Would tune thy praises to his artless shell:
Happy thy task! &mdash; and thou perform'st it well,
Beauty to make more beautiful, by giving
Charms, that all other witching charms excel&mdash;
Charms of the mind, that will for aye be living,
When beauty, like a flow'r has pass'd away,
Transient, of Time the perishable prey.
