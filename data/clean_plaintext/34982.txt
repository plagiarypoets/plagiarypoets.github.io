Ah!  I see, beneath yon Abbey wall,
Where thick the mantling ivy grows,
Crown'd by wide  yew and cypress tall,
Which shade the stream that mournful flows;

There, prone on the bare, joyless bank,
A sullen spectre listless lies:
Nor heeds bleak winds, nor vapours dark,
But earth, and air, and Heav'n defies.

In tatter'd garb this fiend appears,
With felon cordage firmly bound;
And in the bandage vile he wears
Pistole and sheathless blades hung round.

One wither'd hand a cup sustains,
Drugg'd to the brim with liquid fire;
That spreads like lightning thro' the veins,
And instant makes the wretch expire.

The other grasps beneath his vest
A dagger of envenom'd steel;
Whose slightest touch might pierce the breast,
Whose slightest wound no art might heal.

Around his blood-stain'd eye-balls glare,
Each wildly bent to quit its sphere;
Nor will the ardent orbits bear
The moisture of a single tear.

Now upward would the monster scowl,
But that each dark impending brow,
Still spreading as the loud winds howl,
Confines the impious sight below!

O shield me, Heav'n! &mdash; What means that light
Which pours such radiance o'er the stream?
&mdash;It is Religion's banner bright;
The fiend is vanish'd &mdash; like a dream.
