Adzooks!  Master Hodge, you're welcome to Town.&mdash;
How fares all our Friends in the West?
Is Cicily alive, and Thomas and Joan,
And Marg'ry, and Kate, and the rest?

HODGE.
Aye, aye, they're all well, and desires their Love
And good Wishes to you, and to Aunt;&mdash;
But I hates to be plagued with their Nonsense, above
All Things, but this curses long Jaunt.

I longs for the News &mdash; Is 'Squire Wilkes come to Town?
May we hoape to guided by P&mdash;t?
We're hugely dismay'd to hear 'un run down&mdash;
Zoons!  I thought you Town Folks had more Wit.

RALPH.
As to Wilkes, my old Friend, he remains where he was;
And as to his Friends &mdash; why Plague rat 'em!
But poor 'Squire P&mdash;t (all Flesh is but Grass)
Lies decently buried in Chatham.
