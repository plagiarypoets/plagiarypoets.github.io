Autumn was lovely, when her fading woods
Assumed the golden tints of evening sky:
Dear was the lonely music of the floods&mdash;
The plaintive robin's note, and hawk's shrill cry,
The hollow wind that breathed its vesper sigh
O'er the strown leaves in Earth's deserted bower;
When oft, with swelling heart and brimful eye,
I gave my soul to memory's busy power,
And vanish'd years roll's back in one sweet hour.

As round the rifted oak the ivy flings
Its mantling wreaths of melancholy green,
So, to the year gone by, fond memory clings,
And spreads its brightening charm o'er every scene.
Of faded grief and long departed joy,&mdash;
And paints, in magic tints, youth's cloudless dawn,
Its fervent hope of bliss without alloy&mdash;
Its dream of love the rose without a thorn,
That shed its fragrance on life's gentle morn.

Arrayed in gleaming robes of boreal light,
Throned on the rushing wind, fierce winter pours
The drifting storm; and fields, in mourning white,
Bewail their emerald sheen and vernal showers:
Fled now are youth's gay dreams of summer flowers;
And o'er the sorrowing vales and mountains hoar,
Deep gathering, cloud on cloud, the tempest lowers,
And moans the blast like ocean's sullen roar,
When angry surges lash the sounding shore.

Stern Ruler of the year!  thy winds impart
New vigor to the soul, and half dispel
Each gay illusion that enticed the heart
From nobler joys than fancy's treacherous spell
Feigns to bestow, and counterfeits so well:
Beneath thy skies the patriot passion warms
A generous train, with health and freedom blest,
Who love their mountains more when veiled in storms;
As, on the hoary peak, when winds molest,
Cling the young eagles closer to their nest.

In fervid climes, beyond thy rude domain,
The hardy virtues take no root:  nor there
Does Independence hold his fearless reign,
Unfettered, lofty, free as mountain air:
"Thy spirit, Independence, let me share,
Lord of the lion heart and eagle eye!
Thy steps I follow with my bosom bare,
Nor heed the storm that howls along the sky!"
Adoring still, though threat'ning clouds involve,
Thy lofty aim, and nobly firm resolve.
