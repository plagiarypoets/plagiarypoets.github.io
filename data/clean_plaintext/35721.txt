How calm thy vast profound, oh, briny Ocean!
O'er thy dread surface silence creeps serene;
No wind impetuous, and no rude commotion,
Burst on the stillness of the peaceful scene;
The settling billows of thy spacious deep
No longer rend the shore, nor mount the craggy steep.

Warn'd by the shades, in dusky form extending,
All nature smiling, yields to balmy rest;
Faint beams the orb of light, and slow descending,
In blushing glory slumbers on thy breast;
Each breeze retiring to its lonely cell,
Sinks on the bed of night, and whispers out farewell.

Save when along thy wide expansion gliding,
The wand'ring sea-fowl screams her parting lay;
Save when from yonder vessel gently riding,
Soft swells the anthem to expiring day.
No sound obtruding, strikes the list'ning ear,
Or breaks the pensive calm, to meditation dear.

Oh, dread abyss!  thou source of awful wonder!
Whether I view thee when the tempest roars,
When o'er thee rolls the sullen peal of thunder,
And loudly beating on thy echoing shores,
Up the tall cliff thy surge impetuous flies,
Clings to the howling blast, and mingles with the skies.

Whether I view thee when at eve resorting,
Down to the sandy beach my footsteps roam,
When gentle zephyrs on thy bosom sporting,
Kiss thy salt billows, tipp'd with curling foam;
When hush'd to rest, in smooth unruffl'd foam;
Sleeps on thy sinking wave the fury of the storm.

Alike I feel the secret glow of pleasure;
Thy varied scenes emotions sweet impart;
Thy boundless track unfolds an endless treasure,
Exalts the soul, or melts the ravish'd heart;
Alike in thee I read a Maker's praise,
When loud the whirlwind sweeps, or soft the zephyr plays.

Perch'd on these rocks, whose solid base defying,
Frowns on thy waves, and mocks thy raging force,
Here will I match the drowsy night-birds flying,
And trace the progress of thy rapid course;
Here will I mark the fluctuating tide,
And from thy changes learn the fallacy of pride.
