O impious man!  from av'rice blind,
Blind to the sacred light of truth,
Not to discern the lineal mind,
The lineal features in the youth.
Can noble things from base proceed?&mdash;
Not so the lion springs, not so the steed;
Nor from the vulgar tenants of the grove,
Sublimed with pageant-fire, the strong-pounced bird of Jove.
