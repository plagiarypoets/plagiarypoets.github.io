THE ARGUMENT.
Linus doth Lesbia love,
And woe, and win,
And after by her
Lightnesse wrongeth him.

THE SECOND ARGUMENT.
Lovely Lesbia, who might be,
For birth, beauty, quality,
Styled Natures Paragon,
Fram'd for Swaines to dote upon;
In a word for to expresse,
Feature of this Shepheardesse,
If you would her stature know,
She was neither high nor low;
But of such a middle size,
As if Nature did devise,
(For as't seemeth so she ment)
To make her, her president;
With a Sun-reflecting eye,
Skin more smooth then ivory;
Cherrie lip, a dimple chin,
Made for love to lodge him in;
A sweete chearing-chasing sent,
Which perfum'd ground where she went;
A perswasive speech, whose tongue
Strucke deepe admiration dombe.
She, even she, whom all approv'd,
Is by lively Linus lov'd,
And at last (what would ye more)
Though she was betroth'd before
To Palemon, that brave Swaine,
Who quite droupes through her disdaine,
Is with rites solemnized,
Unto Linus married;
Whom he finds (as heaven is just)
After, staind with boundlesse lust,
So as he laments his state,
Of all most unfortunate,
That he should in hope of pelfe,
Wrong both others and himselfe.

I lov'd a lasse, alas that ere I lov'd,
Who as she seem'd to be, if she had prov'd,
A worthier Swaine the countrey nere had bred,
And her I woing won, and winning wed.

TECHNIS.
I like thee Linus, thy preamble's short;

LINUS.
Technis, indeed I am not of that sort.
Who for a thing of nought will pule and crie,
And childishly put finger in the eye;
The burden of my griefe is great to beare.

DORYCLES.
What is it Linus, pray thee let us heare?

LINUS.
The Maid I got, and Lesbia was her name,
Was to another troth-plight ere I came.

CORYDON.
How should she Linus then be got by thee?

LINUS.
It was my fate, or her inconstancie.
Hows'ere I have her, and possesse her now,
And would be glad to give her one of you.

TECHNIS.
Art wearie of thy choice?

LINUS.
Technis, I am,
For I'me perswaded she'd wearie any man.
So seeming smooth she is and ever was,
As if she hardly could say Michaelmas:
But privately so violently fierce,
As I'me afraid her name will spoile my verse.

CORYDON.
This is some hornet sure.

LINUS.
A very waspe,
Whose forked tongue who ever should unclaspe,
Would find't a taske to charme it.

DYMNUS.
Is't so tart;

LINUS.
O Dymnus, that thou didst but feele a part
Of my affliction, thou wouldst surely mone,
And pittie me, that's matcht to such an one;
For tell me shepheards was there ere so rare,
A crime, wherein my Lesbia doth not share?
Proud, (though before as humble to the eye
As ere was Maid) so as one may descrie,
Even by her outward habit what she is,
And by her wanton gesture gather this:
If thou be chast, thy body wrongs thee much,
For thy light carriage saith, thou art none such.

SAPPHUS.
Some fashion-monger I durst pawne my life.

LINUS.
Sapphus 'tis true, such is poore Linus wife,
Though ill it seemes a country Shepheardesse,
Such harsh fantasticke fashions to professe:
One day unto a Barber she'de repaire,
And for what end but this, to cut her haire,
So as like to a Boy she did appeare,
Having her haire round cut unto her eare.

CORYDON.
Good Linus say, how lookt that Minx of thine?

LINUS.
Like to a fleecelesse Ewe at shearing time.
So cowd she was, as next day she did show her
Upon the Downs, but not a Swaine could know her;
So strangely clipt she seem'd, and in disguise,
So monstrous ougly, us none could devise
To see one clad in lothsomer attire:
And this she knew was farre from my desire,
For I did ever hate it.

TECHNIS.
Pray thee Lad
Tell us in earnest how she might be clad!

LINUS.
There is a fashion now brought up of late,
Which here our country Blouzes imitate,
The cause whereof I do not thinke it fit,
If I did know't, for to discover it,
But sure I judge, some rot's in womans joynts,
Which makes them faine to tye them up with points.

DYMNUS.
With points!

LINUS.
Yes Dymnus, that's the fashion now,
Whereof I have a tale, right well I know,
Will make you laugh.

DORYCLES.
Let's heare that tale of thine.

LINUS.
Shepheards you shall; it chanc'd upon a time,
That Lesbia, whose spirit ever would
Observe the fashion, do I what I could,
Bearing a port far higher in a word,
Then my abilitie could well afford:
That she I say into this fashion got,
(As what was th' fashion she affected not)
Of tying on with points her looser waste;
Now I observing how her points were plast,
The Even before she to a wake should go,
I all her points did secretly undo,
Yet therewithall such easie knots did make,
That they might hold till she got to the wake,
Which she not minding.

CORYDON.
On good Linus, on.

LINUS.
She hyes her to the wake (my Corydon)
Where she no sooner came, then she's tane in,
And nimbly falls unto her revessing,
But see the lucke on't, while she scuds and skips,
Her underbody falls from off her hips,
Whereat some laught, while others tooke some ruth,
That she uncas'd, should shew the naked truth.
But heare what happen'd hence, ere th' setting Sunne
Lodg'd in the West, she heard what I had done;
So as resolv'd to quite me in my kind,
Next morne betime, she Hylus chanc'd to find.

SAPPHUS.
Who, Clytus boy!

LINUS.
Yes Sapphus, selfe-same Lad,
Who was a good boy, ere she made him bad.

TECHNIS.
Pray Linus how?

LINUS.
Through her immodestie,
She him allur'd for to dishonour me.

TECHNIS.
Disloyall Lesbia; but pray the shew,
Did Hylus (harmelesse youth) consent thereto?

LINUS.
Technis, he did;

DORYCLES.
How shouldst thou know as much?

LINUS.
She did display't her selfe.

DORYCLES.
Is her shame such?

LINUS.
Yes, and withall defide me to my face,
With such injurious speeches of disgrace,
As patience could not beare.

TECHNIS.
And didst thou beare them?

LINUS.
Yes, Technis yes, and smild when I did heare them
For this is my conceit, it seemeth no man,
To shew his violence unto a woman.

DYMNUS.
Linus sayes well, but womans nature's such,
They will presume if men do beare too much.
For if the tongue upon defiance stand,
The tongue should be revenged by the hand.

LINUS.
Some would have done it Dymnus, but I thought
If I revenge by such base meanes had sought,
The woreld would condemne me; she could blind
Most men with an opinion, she was kind,
But in a modest sort:  for on a time,
Rich Amphybaeus offring to the shrine
Of Panaretus (as there went report)
Sought for her love in a dishonest sort,
With price, with prayer, yet nere attain'd his aime,
To soile her honour, or her vertues staine;

SAPPHUS.
Women are nice when simple heard-men crave it,
And will say nay, when they the fainst would have it.

LINUS.
'Tis right; and now good shepheards tell me true,
Have I not cause, for I'le be judg'd by you,
To mone my hard mishap?

TECHNIS.
Thou hast indeed.

CORYDON.
Thy woes, friend Linus, make my heartstrings bleed;

LINUS.
I thanke you all; but will you heare a song,
Penn'd in the meditation of my wrong!

DORYCLES.
For loves-sake do!

LINUS.
Judge if the descant fit
The burden of my griefe, for this is it;
As for the note before I further go,
My tune is this, and who can blame my woe?

If Marriage life yeeld such content,
What heavie hap have I,
Whose life with griefe and sorrow spent,
Wish death, yet cannot die:
She's bent to smile when I do storme,
When I am chearefull too,
She seemes to loure, then who can cure,
Or counterpoize my woe?

My marriage day chac'd you away,
For I have found it true,
That bed which did all joyes display,
Became a bed of rue;
Where aspes do brouze on fancies floure,
And beauties blossome too:
Then where's that power on earth may cure,
Or counterpoize my woe?

I thought love was the lampe of life,
No life without'en love,
No love like to a faithfull wife:
Which when I sought to prove,
I found her birth was not on earth,
For ought that I could know;
Of good ones I perceiv'd a dearth,
Then who can cure my woe?

Zantippe was a jealous shrow,
And Menalippe too,
Faustina had a stormie brow,
Corinna'es like did show;
Yet these were Saints compar'd to mine,
For mirth and mildlesse too:
Who runs division all her time,
Then who can cure my woe?

My boord no dishes can afford,
But chafing dishes all,
Where selfe-will domineres as Lord,
To keepe poore me in thrall;
My discontent gives her content,
My friend she vowes her foe:
How should I then my sorrowes vent,
Or cure my endlesse woe?

No cure to care, farewell all joy,
Retire poore soule and die,
Yet ere thou die, thy selfe employ,
That thou maist mount the skie;
Where thou may move commanding Iove,
That Pluto he might go
To wed thy wife, who end't thy life,
For this will cure thy wo!

DYMNUS.
I judge by this, that thou wouldst faine forsake her,
And freely give her any that would take her.

LINUS.
Dymnus I would, but I my crosse must beare,
As I have done before this many yeare;
But since our griefes are equally exprest,
Let's now compare which is the heaviest!

TECHNIS.
I lost my Amarillida;

DORYCLES.
But she
Was nothing to Bellina.

DYMNUS.
No, nor she
Like to my faire Palmira.

CORYDON.
Nor all three
Equall to Celia;

SAPPHUS.
Let Silvia be
The onely faire.

LINUS.
Admit, they all were faire,
Your griefes with me, may have no equall share,
For you are free, so as perhaps you may
Make choice of some, may be as faire as they;
But I am bound, and that in such a knot,
As onely death may it unloose, or not.

TECHNIS.
To Linus must we yeeld; but who are these?

DORYCLES.
Two jollie shepheards, that do hither prese,
With ribbon favours, and rosemary sprigs,
Chanting along our Downes their rurall jigs.
As to some wedding boun;

SAPPHUS.
You may presume,
For John unto the May-pole is their tune,
And that's their bridall note.

LINUS.
Let us draw neare them,
Close to this shadie Beech, where we may heare them.

THE SHEPHEARDS HOLY-DAY, REDUCED IN APT MEASURES TO HOBBINALLS GALLIARD, OR JOHN TO THE MAY-POLE.

MOPSUS.
Come Marina let's away,
For both Bride and Bridegroome stay,
Fie for shame are Swaines so long,
Pinning of their head-geare on?
Pray thee see,
None but we,
Mongst the Swaines are left unreadie,
Fie, make hast,
Bride is past,
Follow me and I will leade thee.

MARINA.
On my lovely Mopsus, on,
I am readie, all is done,
From my head unto my foote,
I am fitted each way to't;
Buskins gay,
Gowne of gray,
Best that all our flocks do render,
Hat of stroe,
Platted through,
Cherrie lip and middle slender.

MOPSUS.
And I thinke you will not find
Mopsus any whit behind,
For he loves as well to go,
As most part of shepheards do.
Cap of browne,
Bottle-crowne,
With the leg I won at dancing,
And a pumpe
Fit to jumpe,
When we shepheards fall a prancing.

And I know there is a sort,
Will be well provided for't,
For I heare, there will be there
Liveliest Swaines within the Shere:
Jetting Gill,
Jumping Will,
Ore the floore will have their measure:
Kit and Kate,
There will waite,
Tib and Tom will take their pleasure.

MARINA.
But I feare;

MOPSUS.
What doest thou feare?

MARINA.
Crowd the fidler is not there:
And my mind delighted is,
With no stroake so much as his.

MOPSUS.
If not he,
There will be
Drone the piper that will trounce it.

MARINA.
But if Crowd,
Strucke aloud,
Lord me thinks how I could bounce it!

MOPSUS.
Bounce it Mall, I hope thou will,
For I know that thou hast skill,
And I am sure thou there shalt find,
Measures store to please thy mind;
Roundelayes,
Irish-hayes,
Cogs and rongs and Peggie Ramsie,
Spaniletto,
The Venetto,
John come kisse me, Wilsons fancie.

MARINA.
But of all there's none so sprightly
To my eare, as tutch me lightly:
For it's this we shepheards love,
Being that which most doth move;
There, there, there,
To a haire,
O Tim Crowd, me thinks I heare thee,
Young nor old,
Nere could hold,
But must leake if they come nere thee.

MOPSUS.
Blush Marina, fie for shame,
Blemish not a shepheards name;

MARINA.
Mopsus why, is't such a matter,
Maids to shew their yeelding nature?
O what then,
Be ye men,
That will beare your selves so froward,
When you find
Us inclin'd,
To your bed and boord so toward?

MOPSUS.
True indeed, the fault is ours,
Though we tearme it oft-times yours;

MARINA.
What would shepheards have us do,
But to yeeld when they do wo?
And we yeeld
Them the field,
And endow them with our riches.

MOPSUS.
Yet we know,
Oft-times too,
You'le not sticke to weare the breches.

MARINA.
Fooles they'le deeme them, that do heare them
Say, their wives are wont to weare them:
For I know there's none has wit,
Can endure or suffer it;
But if they
Have no stay,
Nor discretion (as tis common)
Then they may
Give the sway,
As is fitting to the woman.

MOPSUS.
All too long (deare love) I weene,
Have we stood upon this theame:
Let each lasse, as once it was,
Love her Swaine, and Swaine his lasse:
So shall we
Honor'd be,
In our mating, in our meeting,
While we stand
Hand in hand,
Honest Swainling, with his Sweeting.

DORYCLES.
How say you shepheards, shall we all repaire
Unto this wedding, to allay our care?

DYMNUS.
Agreed for me.

TECHNIS.
And I am well content.

CORYDON.
On then, let's make our life a merriment.

SAPPHUS.
See where they come!
May Hymen aye defend them.

LINUS.
And far more joy then I have had God send them.
