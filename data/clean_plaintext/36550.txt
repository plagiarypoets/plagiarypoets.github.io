An only child, the fourteenth summer's bloom
Ripening to woman, in thy angel face,
With promise, that for many years to come
Thou should'st remain a blessing to our race&mdash;
Of temper sweet, with virtues that, alas!
But rarely blossom in a mind so young,
Thy death, O Isa., is a painful case,
Though bending low we check the murmuring tongue,
That from our inmost soul the bitter sigh hath wrung.

Yet when we think upon thy faith and love,
Thy holy joy, thy piety sincere,
Thy patience, which no earthly thing could move,
Thy ardent hope, that soar'd to heaven's high sphere;
We rue the wish that would have held thee here,
Conversant still with griefs, and pains, and sighs;
We joy on thy behalf made meet to share
Of all that bliss which hid in JESUS lies&mdash;
And here thy dust enshrine till glory's dawn arise.
