Virgil awake . . .
Spencer a wake thee from thy clayeie bed
Let tyme throw of deathes dusty coverlid;
Knocke up thy Tytirus too, that bard of yore
Who sleeps close by thee, at next marble dore
Chaucer new scower thy rustye gat, and fyer
Stricke from his Flinty pate, who first did mare
The muses garden with his common shere
And stencht thes flowers, with Nessus poysnous gore,
That Garden wheare thy choysest flowers grew
Those flowers from whence thy bees ther honye drew
Spencer a wake thee see hee's one hos spoyld
Thos Mantuan gemms, and their true Luster soyld
Those gemms, wher with a round embellisht boon
Th' embroydred robes of thy blest Fayrie Queen
Lett hym bee Counted as the mad dog starve
In thy everlasting sheppardes Calendar,
Spencer a wake the lett this scribler know
He doth a scorne to all the muses owe.
Thy tunes heroick for a scourge exchange
And whip from Phoebus hostes this mad doges Mange.
Johnson awake . . .
