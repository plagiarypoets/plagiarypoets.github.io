Another scorns the home-spun threed of rimes,
Match'd with the loftie feet of elder times:
Give him the numbred verse that Virgil sung,
And Virgill selfe shall speake the English tung:
Manhood and garboils shall be chaunt with chaunged feete,
And head-strong Dactils making Musicke meete.
The nimble Dactils striving to outgo
The drawling Spondees pacing it below.
The lingring Spondees, labouring to delay,
The breath-lesse Dactils with a sudden stay.
Who ever saw a colt wanton and wilde,
Yok'd with a slow-foote oxe on fallow field?
Can right areed how handsomly besets
Dull Spondees with the English Dactilets?
If Jove speake English in a thundring cloud,
Thwick  thwack, and rif raf, rores he out aloud.
Fie on the forged mint that did create
New coyne of words never articulate.
