PART THE FIRST.
What, though our way gaunt indigence denies
Where Plato throng'd the academic grove?
That not for us, in heaps of mountain size,
Where bony Gauls for Latian laurels strove,
Lies the grand dome of Capitolian Jove;
'Though we but know from antiquarian tale
That plain, a youth astonish'd chanced to rove,
Charmed with the Doric fanes, the fragrant gale,
And universal blush of Paestum's roseate vale.

Yet we have eyed with awe the stony heap
Where solemn Druids hymned unwritten rhyme;
The hills of green turf, where old heroes sleep;
And towers the Norman liege-lord reared sublime,
Whose builders fondly smiled contempt at time;
Much we have loved o'er fallen fanes to stray,
What time we hear the sheep-bell's distant chime,
The beetle's drowsy horn, and that sweet lay
With which Night's solemn bird proclaims the close of day.

Now we stray here, for yonder arch hung high
Upholds, in pride of picture greatly fine,
A scene of magic to the wondering eye;
The meek Moon blends her light and shade divine;
A robe, on plates of silver foil where shine
Rich knots of spangles, covers yonder mound,
Its Vinca blue and prickly Eglantine;
No flower that grows that beauteous place around,
But has its painted head with flame innocuous crown'd.

This arch, more picture thus, the tall ash shades,
On whose lank arms, the Autumn's early spoil,
The hallow'd misletoe a green wreath braids;
Admitted we revere a long-drawn aile,
The church conventual of a ruin'd pile;
Brackets of human faces, posterns low,
And mouldings richly wrought by fretter's toil,
And windows, erst where robed in gorgeous show
Of Jesse's honour'd race were ranged a tinted row.

Time's palsied hand a ragged outline leaves;
In every rift, (for he is wont to fling
The berry there) sequacious ivy weaves
A nappy frieze to hide unsightly thing,
The ill-faced owl, and bat with devil's wing;
Beneath the walls in safeguard fence is spread
The evil race of weeds that quickly spring,
The teachy nettle with its venom dread,
And arm'd like porcupine, the thistle's threatening head.

Thus wicked Time with his scythe-weapon'd hand,
Has 'reft the fane of its antique array;
I would, we could suspend his rash command,
And take the surly dotard's scythe away,
More mischievous than way-ward infant's play;
Thou, hated History, shalt pen the strain,
For thou canst hold him by his forelock gray,
And stay his wonted hurry, to explain
What ancient glories decked the desolated fane.

In days of old, near Egypt's slimy land,
Their feathery leaves where nesh Acacias spread,
Leaving the haunts of man, a mournful band
By Providence and friendly midnight led,
From chase of shouting Persecution fled;
Of branches lithe their wattled walls they knit,
Of moss and ivy made their evening bed,
And on the green banks at their doors would sit,
Hymning grave canticles, or conning holy writ.

Like birds, unprison'd from a darkling grove,
That the bright eye of prowling hawk beguiled,
The godly race rejoiced at ease to rove;
Some reared thatch'd chapels, that on hillocks smiled
O'er bushy tufts, and soothed some region wild;
Some, by a martyr's grave, with busy spade
A small room scooped beneath the greensward mild,
An uncouth cross upon the round roof laid,
And of the plot anear a cultured garden made.

Some, where a ring of rugged stones was laid,
Like statues, on a pillar's tow'ring height,
With knees, which Faith had chang'd to marble, pray'd;
Their hoar trees dripped with harmless dews of night,
Their fixed eyes gazed unhurt meridian light;
As when Jove's eagle condescends to play,
His plumes he ruffles, droops his winged might,
Fronts his full eye to the attacking ray,
And dares the shaken locks of Him the Lord of Day.

Some hermits were, who dwelled within a rock
Hollow, indented in a sloping ground,
Above, an ancient tree's inclining stock
Spread branchy arms, that shaded all around,
Its crooked roots for beams the loose roof bound;
Before the entrance rude, a gentle stream
Adown the vale its serpent courses wound,
Seen here and there through breaks of trees to gleam,
Gilding their dancing boughs with Noon's reflected beam.

From oozy pores within, depended down,
Congealing stalactites in whiteness pale;
Those mosses interwove their fibrils brown,
Where slimy slug and house-upbearing snail
Their tardy way in glossy streamlets trail;
Fearful of day, along the midnight walls
The armed beetle shone in sable mail,
And insect hammer'd loud, that much appalls
The rest of beldame old, who this the death-watch calls.

Aged the sires, who dwelled such caves within,
Head-shaking sages, prone to moralize,
And him disciple, who there made his inn;
Their cheeks were hollow, slender was their size,
And ever on the ground they bent their eyes; 
One book they had, the book of holy lore,
Against the wall a cross stood leaning-wise,
A table small a scull and cross-bones bore,
And tufts of ivy hid the bell above the door.

In days when such was virtue, where a wood
Edges a green knoll, and a wide stream flows,
Where he that woos the Moon, the vassal flood
His march announcing, oft to greet her goes,
From royal boon, a holy mansion rose
With spires and great tow'r, topp'd with gilded vane,
That emblem meet of man inconstant shows;
The far-off seaman knew where stood the fane
By shades, that hid at length their huge limbs o'er the main.

Thence Vecta's nymph "who checks the westring tide"
With a sleek sister-lady, Ocean's queen,
Is seen in state along the main to ride,
Before the team of dolphins yoked, is seen
The Triton Herald with his tresses green;
While all the region-nymphs their lyres employ,
In pairs parading o'er the marge serene,
To where Southampton's youths and daughters coy
Uncoil the tangled dance to tipsy tones of joy.

On adverse shores, where dark woods brow the strand,
And boat of fisherman floats tilting by,
The massy outworks of beaked Calshot stand,
Breasting the noisy waves, that quarrel nigh;
Work of that King, where awe was wont descry
Lust's putrid eye-ball, pride's oppressing stare,
Hatred's black frown, ambition's bosom high
Musing sublimely-wicked deeds of dare&mdash;
Ah!  never Pity's dove was seen to nestle there!

In middle front the gate-house high was rear'd;
An arch beneath o'erhung an entrance wide;
Within through cloisters dim the rare light peer'd;
The church conventual fill'd one stately side,
Boasting its window train in mitred pride;
The eaves were hid by an embattelled screen;
The vacant court was simply beautified,
All Nature's melody of colour, green,
Had it not here and there with daisies powder'd been.

Without the church, on east end of the pile,
A shade below, the cross exalted flung;
From straddling arches, o'er the highest ile,
Sprung the great tow'r&mdash;there the loud bells were hung,
Each under each, with graduated tongue,
Supreme lords of a boundless world of tone;
The great bell shone its meaner peers among
In portly pride, and its high rank was known
By learned scroll, inscribed around its ample zone.

Methinks I listen, at what horrid time
Forked lightnings cleft the tented sky in twain,
Together when these madding bells 'gan chime,
When pealing organs stunned the vaulted fane,
Mixed with a gabbling wild discordant strain
Of fathers hurrying fast the beadroll round,
When wild hail pelted on the painted pane,
When thunder roared along the blue profound,
And all was one strange grand bewildering war of sound.

From other tower, upon whose vane the bird
Of pertness would his dusky plumage preen,
A stately horologe was hourly heard,
At prime it waked the hinds, at eve serene
It timed their gossip on the village green;
To the tow'r corners pinnacles were join'd,
Of work that let the blue sky peep between,
With numerous mouldings all about entwined,
Fretted in waves, like lakes just ruffled by the wind.

Within the Church, each side the door of wires,
Were blessed saints, that stood in rows along,
And stalls, that upwards shot their many spires,
Lamps, pendent from a ceiling light yet strong
With groins, bright fields of heraldry among;
A choir of gilded tubes, whose voices deep
With storms of music swell'd the ritual song;
Hangings that shook in undulating sweep;
Tassels that flamed like suns, and cushions "soft as sleep."

Aloft the silken gonfalons were rear'd,
That led to Palestine the bold crusade,
Hard by some blade, that much by Paynim feared
Enchanter Merlin's liveried spirits made,
The bearded martyr in scooped niche displayed
The lifted cross and brow to Heaven upraised;
On high installed beneath a sculptured shade,
The Patron-Saint's enamelled image blazed,
For wonder-working deeds and healing virtue praised.

Along a tomb, which painted sculpture dressed,
Armed as for tourney, the knight-warrior lay,
His crossing legs a couching lion pressed,
A helmet was his hind-head's pillowy stay,
His limbs were clothed in battalious array,
A plaited gorget girt his shoulders wide,
His belt was studded thick with bosses gay,
The sword appendant kissed his stony side,
Of rich work were his spurs, the knight's distinguish'd pride.

Long iles of arches sharp and pillars fine,
A pomp of fretted pinnacles upbore,
To form the Founder-Saint's superior shrine;
Like canopy the prostrate image were,
A model of the fane its breast before
One hand sustained; in scrawls and figures quaint,
And letters black, that legendary lore,
Monks loved to tattle of their valued Saint,
They not forgot along the neighb'ring wall to paint.

On the high cross a bleeding Christ was raised,
Of ivory wrought; from types of diamonds bright
Inlaid in gold, a sparkling "INRI" blazed;
From every gem a drop of twinkling light
Shot hues of rainbows on the dazzled sight;
Like glitter on the reliquary played,
Imbost with sculptures of that heav'nly fight,
When fell a show'r of Hosts in arms arrayed
Through Chaos, and his realm of anarchy dismayed.

Beneath the eastern window's pictured pane,
A canopy of fretted stone was spread,
Pavilioning an altar's marble plain,
Each corner rested on an angel's head,
Within lay relicks of the sainted dead;
Two giant torches blazed perennial fires,
A smoke of odours from the censer fled,
The pall, that gorgeous altar's proud attire,
A crimson noon-day glared around the colour'd choir.

How changed that choir, when cease of noble breath
Was thunder'd by the great bell's sullen tongue,
And train conventual did the rites of death;
The holy walls in feral black were hung,
A dim relief the painted scutcheons flung,
A vista reached down to the doorway wide
Of lights, lamps hung the cover'd stalls among,
Yet darkness reigned, but in its starry pride,
Its gloomy majesty attemper'd, dignified.

At the choir end, the altar high before,
A hearse upreared its melancholy mien,
Its fringes flounced a pomp of scutcheons bore,
At here and there, a painted flag was seen;
Where now the nodding of a plume had been,
Like that sweet tree of sorrow, wont to grow
Forlorn, upon some river's margin green,
And weeping, o'er the hurrying waves to throw
The graces of its branch, in elegance of woe.

By sinner reared for wrongful deed of yore,
To the side chantry, a low postern led;
Shrouded in such attire as beadsmen wore,
In its dark house was laid the founder dead,
A row of tapers a bright lustre shed,
The name and race armorial ensigns told,
Around the bier a sable pall was spread,
A bright fringe guarded every curling fold,
With threads, in warrior files with glittering spears of gold.

About the roof a maze of mouldings slim,
Like veins that o'er the hand of lady wind,
Embraced in closing arms the key-stone trim,
With hieroglyphs and cyphers quaint combined,
The riddling art that charm'd the Gothic mind;
To form the floor, a scroll-depicted train
Of glossy tiles, one seemly order join'd;
Deep in the wall, as far as arm could strain,
An iron lattice meshed, a richly tinted pane.

Beneath that window, flowery arbours lay
Their arms abroad where harlot woodbines flung,
And shameless woo'd the winds with them to play;
In allies strait, espaliers prim among,
The rough-skinned pear and glossy apple hung;
On the carved rood, that filled the central place,
Stood hoary saints and angels "ever young;"
Herbs of ill savour filled the vacant space,
With thyme, and baum, and rue, a plant renowned for grace.

An adverse window, shaded by a tree,
Betrayed the school-house, with its little fry
Buzzing, as if a civil polity
Of bees were wont there to and fro to fly,
And diverse trades within their straw shops ply;
More pleasing sounds, when to the chanted rite
Of holy church, they wound their voices high,
Soft was the winged music's downy flight,
And Echo silent was from exquisite delight.

There too, before the monkish cowl was worn,
Two hoary pedagogues tyrannic reign
(Soon as his youthful lacks were closely shorn)
Tutor'd the Novice to a life of pain,
Harsh as of maids, whom aunts unmarried train
Deceiver man at distance meet to hold;
When of the bright-haired monarch's fiery wain
One journey through the pictured signs was told,
In list of monks professed that novice was inroll'd.

He, on such day, in sequester'd cell,
On all the hierarchies of Heaven would call,
To witness that he bade the world farewell;
Ere long the Prior filled his fretted stall,
And hooded conclave lined the chapter wall,
Ere long the sound of coming feet they heared,
A gentle buz began of murmurs small,
Against the door a trembling form appeared,
Whose pale looks marked how much the solemn scene he feared.

Slowly he moved with head upon his breast,
And bent his knee the prior's throne before;
His hands were by the trembling Prior prest;
All silent gazed, the book of holy lore
In solemn step the grave Precentor bore,
A due pause made to aid his fault'ring tongue,
A triple piety of vows he swore,
His lips thrice on the quiv'ring volume hung,
And thrice a loud Amen along the arches rung.

Then two and two they marched, and loud bells tolled,
One from a sprinkle holy water flung,
This bore the relicks in a chest of gold,
On arm of that the swinging censer hung,
Another loud a tinkling handbell rung,
Four fathers went that ringing monk behind,
Who suited psalms of holy David sung,
Then o'er the cross a stalking sire inclined;
And banners of the church went waving in the wind.

Next, while the fane with unwont splendour blazed
Against the lighted altar's velvet plain,
Behold him kneel, his hands to heaven upraised;
Visions of glory his instant brain,
Jesu's meek form, and the immortal train
Of white-robed saints a bright procession hold,
To cherubs carolling a heavenly strain;
While seraphim that float in air, unfold
Their skirts of woven light, and white wings dropt with gold.

Louder and louder swells the choral psalm,
The mighty sounds fresh ecstasy inspire,
The saints applauding wave the branch of palm,
The flitting seraphs strike the golden wire,
Their beamy tresses sparkle in the choir,
Descending clous upon the altar rest,
And light excessive vaults the fane with fire;
He joins the bright procession of the blest,
And glides sublime along a Heaven-admitted guest.

PART THE SECOND.
With clouted shoon at tiptoe peep of morn,
Oft as the herdsman shook the dews away,
He eyed from window small, the forehead shorn
Of elder monk, with roundhead curl of gray,
Gazing if foul or fair uprose the day;
And chanced the bell of prime to tinkle, while
His lowing herds would wander from the way,
To top the wall he scaled the neighb'ring stile
And view'd the gownsmen march by pairs into the ile.

In stately wise first stalked the abbot proud,
And every footstep shook his hood behind,
A man, much greater than the monkish crowd,
And called My Lord, his ceremonious mind
Was to the study of his state confined;
The monks that heard him, ever would commend
What fine words he with lordly gestures joined;
This abbot when he willed to condescend,
Would courteous smile, and call ignoble monk his friend.

Next tried the cell'rer, to whose belt was joined
A clang of keys; a man quite lank and spare
Through fretting much lest aught should be purloined;
Whenever he assized the daily fare,
He surely talked of loss, and waste and wear;
Next he, to whom, at to-fall of the year,
The louting vassals were enjoined to bear
The portioned kingly coin, or autumn's cheer;
They knew how much he chid, nor dared to leave arrear.

With an hoar compeer next the sacrist went,
Of things religious he had custody,
It was his bliss, the holy ornament,
At the magnificence of mass, to see
In order meet and seemly decency;
The pure stream he in sliver vase would bring
For pious needs, and on his doubled knee
Would bid a bead, and wet each holy thing;
No lurking fiend but yelled, and sped his leathern wing.

His compeer hoar the leech's calling plied,
Herbs aromatic, dangling in a noose,
For med'cines to the sick-house beams he tied;
He knew the learned name of each, the juice,
And moon's age when it should be culled for use,
If 'chance his herbs were unavailing found,
He would from a much-treasured volume, chuse
The powers of words of most unwieldy sound,
And add the gestures meet that to those words were bound.

Then with the dean came he who bore the seal,
In him the chapter band were wont confide
Concerns to chronicle of common weal,
Evening in vain in vernal skies has tried
The tints to pencil this old sire supplied;
Within his stall, less noble monks before,
A stand was raised, and there in lifted pride
Leading the Choir his arm aloft he bore,
His strange grimaces made, and stamped the sounding floor.

Last came the trusty man of watch and ward,
A massy key from his bent elbow hung,
Of goers all he kept a keen regard,
Or questioned them with peremptory tongue;
At prime and eve his larum bell he rung,
If to his lodge enquiring strangers went,
His turning window on its hinge he flung,
And, if he so could tell his mind's intent,
Would talk by alphabet of arms and fingers bent.

At cease of bell, ere yet the rites began,
By massy bolts the latticed doors were bound,
The speeding chantor through the office ran;
And now the choir turned to the east around,
Or bowed at name of Jesu to the ground;
The prying dean would sum the gather'd band,
And truant monk if frequent truant found,
With pursed-up brow and angry waving hand,
To scanty fare, and jail of fearful thought command.

(For some there were, when blew the tassel'd horn,
And all the bosky valleys shook for dread,
On the hill tops who met the Youth of Morn,
As from the waves he reared his glorious head;
O'er gossy heaths on fleeting palfreys sped;
With prophane hunters not ashamed to hoot,
Haply if roused from her rush-woven bed,
Upsprung the fearful game with flying foot,
And all the chase began a musical pursuit.)

On that most holy day that heads the seven,
Acting his wavy arm and goggling eyes,
The preacher monk would mix the lore of heaven,
With tales the Phrygian sage was wont devise,
And Fancy's wildest world of quaint surprise,
(Scorn not the light step of the airy maid,
Nature herself, albeit that she is wise,
To make the insect's wing besought her aid,
And sweetly smiled to see what beauteous tints she laid.)

To chapter next, the gown'd procession came
For sage consult, and founder's daily rite
To chant, at each articulated name
A saintly form shot by in robes of white,
And features indistinct of palest light,
Selected next from guiltless monks among,
Exposed delinquents trembled with affright,
These on their breasts their silly faces hung,
While language barbed with fire flew from the prior's tongue.

While thus the monks, before the open'd gate
A mincing palfrey, with a waving load
Of gorgeous trapping, shook his bells in state,
Seeking his neighbour baron's armed abode,
O'er quilted sell the lordly abbot strode,
Spurring his palfrey o'er the field amain,
With tarsel perched upon his fist he rode,
And now he leaned upon the jingling rein,
And his lank dogs of speed ran stretching o'er the plain.

While thus the abbot, to the elmy shade
That girt the grange, the humbler cell'rer hied,
A swinging porthose from his girdle played,
Close to his cheek his russet hood was tyed;
Unlike that abbot swelled with worldly pride,
He rode a steed of most ill-favoured view,
Peaked hips, and staring ribs, and shaggy hide;
Going, the shame of loit'ring monk he knew,
The shame of shoulders streak'd with stripes of livid blue.

Meanwhile along the cloister's painted side
The monks, (each bending low upon his book
With head on hand reclined) their studies plied;
Forbid to parly, or in front to look,
Lengthways their regulated seats they took;
Tho strutting prior gazed with pompous mein,
And wakeful tongue, prepared with prompt rebuke,
If monk asleep in sheltering hood was seen;
He wary often peeped beneath that russet screen.

Hard by, against the windows' adverse light,
Where desks were wont in length of row to stand,
The gown'd artificers inclined to write;
The pen of silver glisten'd in the hand;
Some on their fingers rhyming Latin scann'd;
Some textile gold from balls unwinding drew,
And on strained velvet stately portraits planned;
Here arms, there faces shone in embrio view,
At last to glittering life the total figures grew.

Perchance with train immense of knights and squires,
Some noble dame admires the cloister wall,
Its scrolls of texts and painted gests admires,
The prior points with white wand long and small,
And whispers low what this, what that to call;
Perchance he shows in pictures of the loom,
Some chief who fills in Glory's fane a stall,
Some king, who living look'd a nation's doom,
Or hero armed, whose nod shook conquest from his plume.

At noon-hour (did no fleshless day betide)
On posted trenchers the plain cates were spread,
The snow-white egg, the fish's corned side,
Domestic fowl by barn-door plenty fed,
And best of nutriment fermented, bread;
No thirst was their's but what that juice could pall,
The sugar'd ears of bearded barley shed;
An aged monk was marshal of the hall,
There walking to and fro the servitours to call.

From due ablution, at the vaulted door,
The entering monks stood each one with his mate,
At the two tables of the lowest floor,
Their looks directing to the spiry state
Of chair much-sculptured, where the prior sate;
To this where transversely a board was spread,
Inferior lordlings of the convent ate;
As pass'd the prior, all depressed the head,
Loud rung a tinkling bell, and wonted grace was said.

The prior gave the signal word, aloud
The reader 'gan the lore of God reveal;
At the first stated pause, the holy croud
Turned to the board in instantaneous wheel,
And solemn silence marked their instant meal;
The prior to the reader bowed, again
They turned, the sacrist rang a tinkling peal,
Last grace was said, and carolling a strain
Of David two and two withdrew the hooded train.

Then while the bright sun marched along the sky,
With his spread banner broad of golden sheen,
Kind Sleep his soft hand laid on monkish eye,
Silence reserved enjoyed the peaceful scene,
And musing stalked the space of beds between;
He who did nought these brethren friends esteem,
Would at a cloister window studious lean,
Gazing with fixed eyes in a kind of dream,
Or stooping with low brow to pore upon his theme.

(He thought, where ancient Isis winds her way
To hear Apollo's lute of silver sound,
And sisters nine chant their alluring lay,
To see by all their worshippers renowned,
About his brows a laureat wreath be wound,
A train of convents to parade his praise,
A train of abbots proud, with mitres crowned,
Of knights, whose helmets stole the sunny rays,
And barons with wrought cloaks of gorgeous noon-day blaze.)

Then where the porter in his lodge secure,
With open porthose sat, and conned his prayers,
A multitude of old and female poor
Assembled, canvassing their own affairs,
Usage unneighbourly, or household cares,
Ere long the almoner in lifted view
Beckon'd their way unto the gatehouse stairs;
Their pucker'd aprons into folds they drew,
And almoner therein the victual fragments threw.

Soon as the weary day was west'ring far,
And nightmares on their short squab legs upsprung,
To drag some ugly dream's fantastic car
The branchy lamp a yellow radiance flung,
And to his harp the hosted minstrel sung
His chiming song of Wizard, Fay, or Sprite,
Along the wires his lightning fingers rung,
His meteor eyeballs blazed with strange delight,
And sparkling flames outrushed and skirmished with the night.

Or p'rhaps while melody that minstrel made,
Some proper tutor and the novice train,
In dress dramatic holy writ arrayed;
Here with bright eyes and cheek of rosy stain
A smiling David tripp'd o'er Elah's plain;
There in the studied looks of Saul were shown,
Hoped and yet feared success, dissembled pain;
(A youth by his ungainly limbs o'ergrown,
Strutted with weighty sword the man of mighty bone.)

(Were it a certain consecrated day,
The the bishop-boy, and his procession small
Of hornbook people marched in long array,
Decked with the mitre, sandals, staff, and pall,
He scaled the laughing choir's superior stall,
His little train paired off on either side,
Strange was the scene, when they endeavour'd all
The chanted mass with discords to divide,
And howled and yelled and grinned and hissed and laughed and cried.)

Or perhaps was dragged into some area forth,
To sturdy mastives that stood watching nigh,
A Bear, the hairy native of the North;
Methinks I see him roll his angry eye,
Against his furry sides the mastives fly,
They snap, and show their teeth's embattled row,
He growls and on his hind feet ramping high,
Between his closed paws grasps a dying foe,
Whose eyes jut from his head, and flaggy tongue hangs low.

Or perhaps a train of jigging puppets dance
Their wooden muscles hard and nerves of wire,
Or here and there the nimble fingers glance
Of Tregetour, with him in quaint attire
Who ribbands eats, and vomits flames of fire;
Quite happy monks, did nature's general law
Let simple man to feats so great aspire,
But no, beneath the cover'd board they saw,
The grand fiend's visage grim and horns and horrid claw.

Or perhaps to gambol in the slanting sun,
The menial train to grassy leas withdrew,
With pensioned sires whose days of deed were done,
Then where two banks of green turf met the view,
They tugg'd alternately their bows of yew,
And 'chance the grove of bristling shafts among,
A gifted one had pierced the centre tree,
With peals of loud applause the welkin ring,
And the gray sires 'gan tell what they atchieved when young.

All sudden stopp'd &mdash; the great bell's sullen roar
Proclaim'd the day's, the toil's, the pastime's close,
The dormitory oped its massy door,
From pendent lamps a circling smoak arose,
The fleecy pallets lay along in rows,
Each proper one by wall between confined,
There couched the monk, nor doffed his russet cloaths,
For he who dared his covered limbs unbind,
Was surely chid, and deemed to freakish sins inclined.

PART THE THIRD.
In iron times, when laws of battle were,
That weakly folk, of prowess small in fight,
The galling gyves of vassalage should bear;
Ere Castle Seneschalls with pale affright
Heard the shrill horn wind of the errant knight,
A foeman firm affianced to be
To all who wronged the feeble of their right;
Such folk the church let from their thraldom free,
A deed that had not shamed the knight of chivalry.

The holy church too in those iron times
With dreadful sanctity of forms array'd,
A pomp of shows for cognizance of crimes,
It might false charge uncourteous rumour laid,
Of foulest blot on fame of gentle maid;
Her eyes were veiled, her lilly feet were bare,
A burning row the ploughshares nine displayed,
The guileless maid was heaven's peculiar care,
Angels her veil upheld, and Cherubs cried "Beware."

Was it that sin so much to belldames' shame,
Of horsing broomstaves through the vault of night,
And calling taloned devils up by name,
Who coming would for sport the neighbours fright;
Such belldames' arms and feet they corded tight,
Plunged them in pools, and on the green banks stood
Wond'ring, if they to the arch-wicked spright
In hellish deed had signed their names in blood,
For such bad belldames always sunk beneath the flood.

Judicial duels (so the times behoved,
When men were wont oft from her lifted throne
To shoulder Justice) holy church approved,
With heaps of arms the sacred courts were strown,
And glittering death on points of lances shone,
A beauteous band of blue-eyed maidens came,
And she whose guilty love was over-thrown,
Would hide her eyes, and hang her head for shame,
Tearing the silken gifts of that unworthy flame.

And in those iron days, if fell despight
Of feodal chieftain galled the bosom sore,
The relick hoard was sunned by unknown light,
And on the thighbone of a saint he swore,
Spite to eschew, as taught God's holy lore,
Nor dared false fear that feodal chief to feign,
For monk would deep in his remembrance store,
The ruthful banquet of a bragging Dane,
Who was by sword unseen of scorned St. Edmund slain.

And in those iron times, no forest wide
But shrouded robbers and assassins fell,
For Justice knew not well her way to guide,
Not having Custom's clue, to that lorn cell
Where they were wont 'mid ferns and briars dwell;
Can there be one in better ages born,
Who has not heard delighting infants tell,
Of Robin Hood, his bow and bugle horn,
And how he chased the deer o'er Sherwood's wilds forlorn?

Ah me!  much irks it fearful mind to tell,
Such trespass vile how holy church dispraised;
In middle mass, the great reluctant bell
By minutes tolled, the cross on high was raised,
And now the lighted torch, that sudden blazed,
As sudden quenched, a dreary symbol showed;
The kneeling sinner in dumb horror gazed,
The mass priest's cheek with burning blushes glowed,
While slowly syllabled these formal curses flowed.

"Dark be those eyes, that dare with lust behold
Another's earnings, in eternal night;"
Amen, and slowly once the great bell tolled;
"Those hands be shrivell'd by a withering blight,
That wealth purvey by deeds of unjust might,"
Amen, and once the great bell tolled again;
"Like fortune on the guilty limbs alight,
Such hands that aid;" at end of every strain
The great bell tolled, Amen responded all the train.

"Be all thy days incessant cursed with toil;
Be void of rest, and yet to rest inclined;
Be all thy booty but another's spoil;
Bewild'ring jeopardies o'erhang thy mind,
Nor backward look but foes pursuing find;
Of peril quit, still to thy listening ear
A speeding horseman sound in every wind;
Till lacking crimson life thy carcase fear,
Through never-ceasing pain shall press an early bier.

"And soon as doomed to press that early bier,
In damned talons be thy soul conveyed
To the accursed house of Death and Fear
And Darkness; there be thy allotment made
With Judas who the Lord of Life betrayed;
Refining in expurgatory flame,
Be there thy agonizing spirit laid,
Until immaculate of sin and shame,
It meet be to invoke a Saviour's hallowed name.

"Long as such sins thy guilty soul imbue,
So long these curses in dread force remain,
So long these curses shall those sins pursue."
Amen &mdash; Amen returned the total train,
Fiat &mdash; a general Fiat shook the fane;
Still kneeled that robber, with erected hair
And features smiling horribly with pain,
Now Frenzy roll'd his eyes, and now Despair
Changed them to sightless orbs with petrifying stare.

Such were the customs of our days of old,
For not those days the sun of science cheered;
Our song historical must now unfold
More mournful tales; when holy Henry steered
The bark of state, a novel race appeared,
Who rules to preach and proselyte obeyed,
Though for their home a proper fane was reared,
No annual bounty to the fane was paid.
For all the friar race were mendicants by trade.

Unwise it was, for mendicants by trade
Are skilled their tongues, as chrystal smooth, to file,
Their fanes were with unequal pomp arrayed,
In near proportion as these sons of guile,
Could flatter, talk, profess, and cringe and smile;
"For ever they to conscience would appeal,
If idle monk ought live by other's toil,
No envy their's, it was becoming zeal
To speak tho truth of those, who damaged public weal."

Who sees not faults?  and faults in monks there were,
The monk not scorned to play the juggler's part,
Penance aloft his whip of wire might bear,
More mighty Nature would disdain the smart;
The hand that toiled not, could but waste the mart;
And crimes were rife, for crimes through them had grace,
The monk not knew within his narrow heart,
That scope of feeling for our general race,
That like the eye of God admits no bound of place.

The day was come, and what has not its day?
All things regard from use or pleasance gain,
Nor longer needed was the dread array
Of superstitious thunder, to restrain
Hunters and warriors in a feodal reign;
Commerce was building bourses on the land,
Aided by Industry, Art's handmaid train,
And Plenty boon, a nymph was with the band
Called Printing, almost deemed to wield a magic wand.

The day was come &mdash; Fame trumpeted abroad
A six-times-wedded monarch's ban of wrath;
Upstarting War unsheathed his instant sword,
Rebellion led her rabble-legions forth,
Her flag unfurling in the stormy North;
Along the clam'rous vanguard stalked Despair,
While busy Superstition nerved the loth;
Pale Inj'ry laid her bleeding bosom bare,
And Rev'rence show'd with dust defiled his hoary hair.

This horrid while, against the fane forlorn
The banded fields of hell unwearied toiled,
High on a pinnacle stood grinning Scorn,
The axe of false Zeal charms of art defiled,
And talon'd Sacrilege looked up and smiled,
With severing engine as she vestments shore,
Recorded good erasing Envy spoiled,
While snatching Violence the charters tore,
And scrambling Rapines off the flying fragments bore.

For monk until a figure new they made,
Four fiends were busied in a secret nook,
The fit materials stammering Ign'rance laid,
For Prejudice, that could but one way look,
Hypocrisy, that thumbed the sacred book,
And crabbed Austerity, that smiling blamed;
For speech they texts of holy scripture took,
For his stiff neck a band dependent framed,
And this their figure new a Puritan surnamed.

Sedition meanwhile in black gall imbued,
A sheaf of arrows from her quiver'd store,
And with that archery the monks pursued,
Who fled the Giant Danger's strides before,
And trunk of tree his breadth of shoulder bore;
The deed was done, the looking fiends were dumb;
When fleeing all at once, the air they tore
With yells that midnight travellers benumb,
Groans of the damn'd in hell, and shrieks of Doomsday come.

So fell the monkish fane, and we might deem
Were here and there not ivied ruins spread,
It ne'er had been, or but a first sleep's dream;
It fell, and doomed to hide her banish'd head
For ever, Gothic Architecture fled;
Forewarned she left in one most beauteous place,
That much might of her ancient fame be said,
Her pendent roof, her window's branchy grace,
Pillars of cluster'd reeds, and tracery of lace.

Be courteous, Commerce &mdash; in no sullen mood
Too harshly gibe the monk's less active bent;
For from thy foeman baron's wassails rude,
Where sanctuary a holy dwelling lent,
The wattled flocks, the craftsman's canvas tent,
The morrice-dancer with his marrion queen,
And the famed dog of British hardiment
Baiting the bull and bear, were frequent seen
In motley crowds to sport along the peopled green.

Be courteous, Commerce &mdash; there are bridges high,
Ranging their salient angles o'er the strand,
Which the monks reared; where some proud dwellings lie,
A fane exorcised agues from the land;
Hard by conceive its buttress rows to stand,
And fine perspective of a range of spires;
Where lie yon leas, upplucked by monkish hand,
Their rushes crackled on the daily fires,
Monks delved that foss where-through the brumal flood retires.

Be courteous, Learning &mdash; think what Monks would write,
Figuring strange signs they had wizards seen;
Seen dapper furies by the Moon's pale light,
In quaint rings dance about their tiny queen;
Grim ghosts with stony eyes flit o'er the green;
Steeds of bright brass that to the board updrew,
Where sat the Soldan with astonished mien;
Or dragons, such as George of Britain slew,
Spout smoky hurricanes of flame and sulphurs blue.

(TRUTH, I would fain but cannot thee commend,
For thou art Superstition's enemy,
And she to Song has been an ancient friend;
Can'st thou not hide the terrors of thine eye,
Hold down thy mirror, and pass smiling by?
Must we thy beams depopulating rue?
Yes, and the visionary race must fly;
But stay thy steps, imperious maid, and view
One backward glance of scorn, their noble proud adieu.)

Be courteous, Learning &mdash; tales of times of old
Of Troynovant, of ancient British land,
For you the monkish Chroniclers have told;
Before you, lo!  the greybeard Fathers stand,
Holding the holy Martyrs by the hand;
Lo classic Bards, with their thrice triple train
Of Attic ladies, sing at your command;
Say could a gifted Poet form a strain
For Oxford's earl, that not attends the monkish fane?

Learning, some monks were very deeply taught,
Speech they could all into its parts divide,
But these knew how to prank a showy thought,
And a minutely-subtle science plied,
Drawn from the lore that man to God allied;
Our laws they tinctur'd with that emp'ror's page,
Amalfi's rocks were fated long to hide,
Who could like them with mighty quibbles wage,
The syllogistic war of fumed Stagyra's sage?

Learning, this lore is deemed of nought to be,
Unlovely we from trial sad attest,
Yet hence the scornful Nymph Philosophy,
In robe succinct for loosely floating vest,
Was by the matron strict Precision drest;
And had not hooded Superstition flung
On speech o'er vulgar wont her high behest,
The sluggard schoolboy ne'er had lisped the tongue,
That Tully chastely spoke, and Maro chastely sung.

Shades of past fame, farewell!  the glooms ye cast!
The melancholy pleasure ye have bred!
There are, who fain would fly into the past,
And where I but a weeping pilgrim tread,
As cowled monks hide for aye the aching head!
Alas!  there now are no Elysian bowers,
To sepulchre among the living dead,
A lost thing, when Life's day in tempests lours,
And Grief the painted wings rends of the shrieking Hours.

Pause, cries a willowed Youth, in shades like these,
With hopeless flames a virgin victim glows,
The pride of needy ancientry to please,
For ever lost to love, my only rose,
The sweetest flower of all my Eden blows,
Go, weeping girl, and this thought with thee bear,
That scarce a wish my jealous bosom knows,
Save that of trowing thy torn limbs in air,
But greater virtue checks the greatness of despair.
