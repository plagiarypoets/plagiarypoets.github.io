Where is the voice of wailing?  the loud prayer
Of sorrowing bosoms with keen anguish riven,
And the shrill cry of agoniz'd despair
That once the flitting winds had borne to heaven
Which moaning round the fretwork, kiss the scar
And wither'd  herb that graces thee, awaking
A kindly feeling, while the raptur'd ear
Lists to the music which those winds are making?
Where are th' uplifted hand? &mdash; the bended knee?
And the low breathing sounds of soothing minstrelsy?

Where is the mournful pageantry that stay'd
In darker day its stately course awhile
Around thee, when the clay-cold corpse, array'd
In funeral honours, linger'd near the pile,
E'er yet consign'd to earth? &mdash; the dissonant cry
"Peace to his soul" &mdash; where is it? &mdash; which ascended
From hundred tongues to that untroubl'd sky
Where feuds, and strife, and worldly cares are ended?
Where is the pealing anthem and the song
That burst with one accord from all the motley throng?
