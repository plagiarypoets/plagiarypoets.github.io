Say, favour'd Bard, to whom her costly store
Flora has given to scan with raptured sight
Her pearly buds of mantle silver hoar,
Her gems that flame in golden radiance bright,
Each straggling sweet that on the  mountain's height
Drinks the pure effluence of the orient beam;
Or in the valley's deep umbrageous night
Pensively meek, bends o'er the glassy stream:
Ah, why thereon thy wild romantic dream
Fancy indulgent sheds her choicest dews?
Why does thy groundless fear the novel theme
To the fixed ear of public taste refuse,
That to remotest years shall crown thy name
With the bless'd guerdon of a deathless fame!
