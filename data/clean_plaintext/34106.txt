See the Fathers of Verse,
In their rough uncouth dress,
Old CHAUCER and GOWER array'd;
And that Fairy-led Muse,
Which in SPENSER we lose,
By Fashion's false power bewray'd.

In SHAKSPEARE we trace
All Nature's full grace,
Beyond it his touches admire;
And in FLETCHER we view
Whate'er Fancy could do,
By BEAUMONT's correcting its fire.

Here's rare Surly BEN,
Whose more learned pen
Gave laws to the Stage and the Pit,
Here's MILTON can boast
His Paradise Lost;
And COWLEY his Virtue and Wit.

Next BUTLER, who paints
The zeal-gifted Saints;
And WALLER's politeness and ease;
Then DRYDEN whose lays
Deserv'd his own bays,
And, labour'd or negligent, please.

There sportively PRIOR
Sweeps o'er the whole lyre,
With fingers and fancy divine;
While ADDISON's Muse
Does each virtue infuse;
Clear, chaste, and correct, in each line.

To close the whole Scene,
Lo!  POPE's moral spleen;
Ye Knaves, and ye Dunces, beware!
Like lightening he darts
The keen shaft at your hearts,
Your heads are not worthy his care.
