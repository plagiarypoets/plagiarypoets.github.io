First-born of night, that o'er the western heaven
Slow mov'st in radiant silence to thy rest!
What sad emotion, 'mid the smiling even,
Thy bright-beam'd circlet pours upon my breast!
'Tis not &mdash; fair star! &mdash; that shedding aught of woe,
Thy ray can touch the spring of mortal tear,
But that, in happier days, past long ago,
When yon dark hill receiv'd thy bright career,
True to the promis'd hour, my Ellen met me here!

Ye spires, where soothing tolls the vesper bell,
To wearied hamlets welcome sound of peace,
To me your tones seem Hope's departing knell,
Vibrating slowly on the sullen breeze!
Yes &mdash; peace to quiet minds the murmurs yeild&mdash;
To mine, no more!  For near this shadowy grove,
When silent ev'ning heard yon signal peal'd,
Light o'er the lonely glade, she dar'd to move,
And Ellen's lips met mine, the first warm kiss of love!

Speed not, fair star!  to thine accustom'd hill!
Your varying melody, ye spires, give o'er!
Those rays no more mine eyes with rapture fill&mdash;
Those tones can bid my heart to throb no more!
For to a distant land, condemn'd to mourn
A parent's ruin'd fortune, Ellen flies!&mdash;
She fled, alas! &mdash; but never to return!&mdash;
And other peals are  heard, and stars arise,
O'er the unnoticed grave, where gentle Ellen lies!
