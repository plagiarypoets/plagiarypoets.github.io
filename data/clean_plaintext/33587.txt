Our Spencer was a Prodigie of wit,
Who hath the Fairy Queen so stately writ:
Yield Grecian Poets to his Nobler Style;
And ancient Rome submit unto our I'le.
You modern wits, of all the four-fold earth,
(Whom Princes have made Laureates for your worth)
Give our great Spencer place, who hath out-song
Phoebus himself with all his Learned Throng.
