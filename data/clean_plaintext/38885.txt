Dear Shade &mdash; if injur'd Spirits wander near
The cold Couch where their Victim-forms recline,
Oh come at ev'nings twilight hour, and hear
And breathe thy last farewell to me on thine&mdash;
For here I sit and think at day's decline&mdash;
Thy early bloom &mdash; sweet hours &mdash; for ever gone&mdash;
So mild &mdash; so tender &mdash; e'er thou did'st resign
Thy whole heart up to Passion's thrill alone&mdash;
All lov'd and mourn thee, hapless youth, save one.

And she was all to thee &mdash; till thou to her
Wert mock'ry's sport &mdash; so sad and so subdued&mdash;
As wanton winds the stealing lock bestir,
She took and toss'd thee from her bosom rude&mdash;
The reel of triumph met the eye that woo'd&mdash;
Ungentle Conqu'rer, when the prize was won,
To break the bruis'd reed! &mdash; 'twas then we view'd
Thy gentleness &mdash; thy reason &mdash; all undone&mdash;
All mourn &mdash; for all did love thee &mdash; all &mdash; save one!
