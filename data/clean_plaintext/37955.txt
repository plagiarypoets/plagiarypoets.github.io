By ornaments and looks that female group,
Aiming to fascinate the gazer's eye,
Fancy may paint transform'd into a troop
Of trick'd out skeletons, who vainly try
To hide their fleshless forms, shrivell'd and dry;&mdash;
The eyeless sockets  show a brainless head;&mdash;
They breathe &mdash;no &mdash; through their bones the breeze did sigh,
Their clattering motion strikes the soul with dread:
We see the mask of life, worn by the spectral dead!
