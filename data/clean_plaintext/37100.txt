Had not thy righteous law been my delight,
When friends forsook and earthly comforts fled,
And cruel foes display'd their envious spite,
Most surely I had sunk among the dead,
And cold oblivion's dew had rested on my head.

Yet still I live, Oh, let my praise arise,
To Him who, cloth'd with majesty and might,
And seated in his temple of the skies,
Sends gifts to man, with peace, and life, and light;
But thou, my soul, art vile and sinful in his sight.

Oh, lead me from those paths with error fraught,
Whose snares too oft my heedless steps betide;
Restrain the hasty speech, and roving thought,
And fear of feeble man, and causeless pride,
And all the secret ills that in my heart reside.
