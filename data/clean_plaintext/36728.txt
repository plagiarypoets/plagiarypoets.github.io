I loathe to live, and yet I fear to die;
There is a dreary chill upon my heart;
I know that earth's a scene of vanity,
And from its toils and cares would fain depart
But from futurity appall'd I start!
I have no promis'd hope beyond the tomb,
And consciences' keen arrows through me dart
A dire conviction of my dreaded doom,&mdash;
Filling my troubled soul with agony and gloom.

Now all the sins and errors of the past,
Rise up in dread array before my sight;
And dark despair hath o'er my bosom cast
Her pall of murky gloom as black as night.
Oh!  my forsaken God, forget not quite
Thine erring creature in this awful hour;
Shed o'er my soul a beam of heavenly light,
And by thy great, thine all-redeeming power,
Dispel the heavy clouds that o'er my spirit lower.

Lo, at thy feet a suppliant I bow!
A naked, poor, and vile, and wretched thing:
Oh, come not with thy dreaded terrors now,
As to thy mercy-seat appall'd I cling!
Nor on my helpless head those thunders fling,
Which even angels might regard with dread;
But unto me the promis'd succour bring,
Bought by his gracious love who groan'd and bled,
And for rebellious man a life of suffering led.

Cast me not off, my Father, and my God!
Though far from thee I long have gone astray;
I now, with humble fear, can kiss the rod
Of thine afflicting providence, and say,
"Thy will be done!"  'tis ours but to obey.
Yes, unto thee, the omnipresent friend,
The Saviour-Lord of all who keep thy way,
I fly, and on my knees before thee bend;
To thee alone I come, on thee alone depend!
