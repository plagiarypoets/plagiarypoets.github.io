Swift o'er the hemisphere, celestial Morn
Pours fairest light, to beautify the Spring;
Pure dews the fresh delightful fields adorn
With trembling lustre, fann'd by zephyr's wing;
The sloping hills and sunny vales appear
In May's delightful hues, the beauty of the year.

O!  what a burst of music fills the grove,
When birds, awaking, hail the infant day;
Sweet nightingales, with melting sounds of love,
And linnets, larks, and thrushes join the lay,
Some on the wing in airy circles fly,
'Light on the hedge in pairs, or soar into the sky.

In full perfection shines the gay parterre,
Where yonder noble mansion tow'rs sublime;
Refreshing odours fill the morning air,
Where blending sweets rise from the flow'ry prime;
The rose, all balmy spirit, chears the sight,
Carnation's gorgeous bloom, and lillies spotless white.

Adjoining, see the shrubbery adorn
The pleasure-ground, with various shades of green;
And roseate blossoms, fair as smiling morn,
Where she ascends the vernal skies serene;
And see the tender nursery of trees,
With springing verdure crown'd, light waving in the breeze.

Come, Fancy!  let us range the living mead,
And pluck the pendent cowslip from its stem;
Or to the river's brink thy vot'ry lead,
To gaze, delighted, in the passing stream;
There live the finny tribes, that, glitt'ring, play
In the pure element, enjoying chearful day.

Thus would I live, with Innocence and Peace,
Nor e'er unconscious view the varying year;
But, with the gifts of Time, my joy encrease,
And bless the gracious Pow'r who plac'd me here.
O!  whilst I God's amazing works admire,
May Piety unfeign'd my bright'ning soul inspire.
