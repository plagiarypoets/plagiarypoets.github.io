Nature's first born, hail to thee,
Rustic Nymph, Simplicity!
Drest in robes of russet gray,
Sprightly as the month of May:
Fairer than the Graces three,
Rural Goddess, hail to thee!
Come, and smiling bring with thee
Mildly blushing Modesty:
Innocence with brow serene;
Rosy Health, the woodland Queen:
Calm Content, with chearful air:
Piety, the heaven-born fair:
Virtuous Love, devoid of guile,
Tripping on with infant smile;
Blessing on the happy plains,
Artless nymphs, and constant swains:
Votaries true to Love and thee,
Rural Queen, Simplicity!

Goddess come; and sit with me
Underneath some aged tree;
Listening to the woodlark's lay,
Sweetly warbling on the spray;
Or the milkmaid in the dale,
Tripping on with brimming pail;
Whilst her swain, with eager feet,
Hastes his much-lov'd fair to meet;
Now he bears her frothing pail,
Jocund homeward thro' the vale;
Now they sit beneath the shade,
Nature kind for love has made;
Breathing fresh, with harmless glee,
Tales of pure Simplicity.

Or we'll join the harvest train
Shouting jovial o'er the plain;
Hear them jest, and sing, and laugh,
While their nutbrown ale they quaff;
When the farmer all the while
Views their mirth with heartfelt smile,
Pleas'd to see the ripen'd year
Rich repay his honest care;
Scenes like these, best suit with thee,
Rural Queen, Simplicity.

Thee my Muse shall still attend;
Thee, the Muses fairest friend;
Lead her to thy sacred Power,
There thy softest influence shower,
Which inspired the bards of yore,
Rich in Nature's genuine lore;
And of late, with heavenly fire,
Gray and Goldsmith did inspire:
Happy Bard, belov'd of thee,
Queen of Verse, Simplicity.

Goddess, still to to thee I sue,
And my earliest prayer renew:
Give me Shenstone's gentle lay,
Or the tuneful lyre of Gay;
Or at least the Doric reed,
Cunningham's inferior meed,
Breathing strains inspired by thee,
His best-belov'd Simplicity.

Let me charm the nymphs and swains,
Pleas'd with Nature's artless strains;
Let me draw the silent tear,
From the shepherd's eye sincere;
Or in strains that softly move
Melt the maid to virtuous love;
Or on country festal days
Tune my reed their mirth to raise:
Thus, unenvied let me sing,
Jocund as the smiling Spring;
Happy, if approv'd by thee,
Rural Queen, Simplicity.
