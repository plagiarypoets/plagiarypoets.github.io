Darke is the day, when Phoebus face is shrowded,
And weaker sights may wander soone astray;
But when they see his glorious raies unclowded,
With steddy steps they keepe the perfect way:
So while this Muse in forraine landes doth stay,
Invention weepes, and Pens are cast aside,
The time like night, deprivd of chearfull day,
And few do write, but (ah) too soone may slide.
Then, hie thee home, that art our perfect guide,
And with thy wit illustrate Englands fame,
Dawnting thereby our neighboures ancient pride,
That do for poesie, challendge cheefest name.
So we that live and ages that succeede,
With great applause thy learned works shall reede.
