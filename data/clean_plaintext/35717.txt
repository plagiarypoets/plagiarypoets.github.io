THE HOUR BEFORE THE BATTLE.
The Muse, on Fancy's eagle pinion borne,
To yonder scene, advent'rous, bends her way,
Where from grim visaged War's terrific horn
Sounds the dire prelude of the desperate fray:
Fate left to shrink, shrink by the dread display
Of Havoc's enginery:  Mute order reigns,
Patient, but eager, are the dense array
Borne, like a whirlwind, o'er the bellowing plains.
Valour, his calm, unalter'd mein retains,
Whilst the fierce onset's signal he expects&mdash;
Chill runs the blood in Pity's curdling veins,
As on the fatal issue she reflects.
The charge is sounded! &mdash; Fancy stirs the scene;
Where, Carnage!  all thy furies fell convene.

THE HOUR AFTER THE BATTLE.
Fancy returns on timorous wing again
To view the scene that savage Slaughter left;
Where Havoc still, tho' silent, seems to reign,
And grim Despair of life's last hope bereft!
The broken scimitar &mdash; the helmet cleft&mdash;
The shatter'd musket &mdash; and the splinter'd shell&mdash;
All that escaped the victor's rage, or theft,
After the Battle's fate, a sad tale tell.
Peace to the manes of the Brave who fell!
Their toil is ended, and their suff'rings o'er&mdash;
But ah! what pangs the heart of Pity swell,
To see the wounded welt'ring in their gore!
Accursed War!  to punish mortals meant,
Such are the pictures thy dread scenes present!
