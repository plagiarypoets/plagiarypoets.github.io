A Pert young hazle once bespoke,
In terms like these, a sturdy oak:

What lofty branches still are spread,
Around your vast extensive head;
And what a piece of fertile ground,
Your root encompasses around;
Your bulk, how vast, but pray what use
Does all your mightiness produce?
So horrid brackish is your fruit;
While I, a low and simple tree,
A pigmy unto giant thee,
A pleasing milky burthen bear,
Admir'd by all the young and fair,
Who ever listen to the cry,
Of hazle-nuts, come crack and try!
But when were acorns ever known,
Thus to be sung about the town.
Were I the farmer, well I know
I'd send you somewhere else to grow,
Nor let you longer thus expand,
To over-shadow half my land;
And in your place I'd hazle put,
There is some profit in a nut.

Thou empty thing, the oak reply'd,
I answer but to check thy pride;
For 'tis beneath an oak like me,
To answer such a twig as thee:
Know, from my trunk are bulwarks made,
Employ'd to distant worlds in trade;
Or when invidious foes appear,
I o'er the ocean thunders bear;
When fleets engage in fire and smoke,
Would hazles do as well as oak:
A vessel formed of wood of thee,
Call it &mdash; the nut-shell of the line.
Your emptiness no longer shew,
To talk of what you do not know;
Crack of your nut, but crack no jokes
In future with us tough old oaks;
A sapling gather'd from my head,
If well apply'd, would strike thee dead.

To fops and fools the moral's shewn,
Boast not what trifles are your own.
