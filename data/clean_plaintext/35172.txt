IDYL.  I.
Go festal bark, and Pleasure spread thy sails!
Indulgent Trent reflects a lover's smile,
And woos with whispering reed such gentle gales,
As speed thy course, nor vex his wave the while.
Go by the marge of his fair winding vales
To yon romantic cliff, whose sainted pile
With all its waving oaks thy coming hails!
Exulting go &mdash; yet mindful that the fate
Of thousand hearts must on thy safety wait,
For never Cyprian bark could boast so fair a freight.

IDYL.  II.
Romantic Cliff, in Supersition's day,
Whose chamber'd rock was scoop'd by holy hand!
Where lost to earth (as Cloyster-Legends say)
His church and cell some woe-worn Anchoret plan'd!
Yet chose he not a drear ungenial site;
See o'er that smooth expanse of pastures green,
What giant mountains heave their distant height;
While glitters, as he winds, bright Trent between!
Those lone and lifted towers, that awe the West,
See frowning still o'er Mary's regal woes!
And mark that graceful spire above the crest
Of yon fair hill, where Mercia's kings repose!
Religious cliff!  forgive, with other view,
With vow less holy, if our pilgrim train
Short sojourn sweet in thy recess renew,
Nor deem gay Pleasures festal rites prophane,
Where Beauty's smile divine illumes thy rural reign!

IDYL.  III.
Return, lov'd bark, for lo, the falling day,
Throws shadowy light athwart Trent's osier'd edge,
While hast'ning from the dashing oar away,
The timid cygnets seek the sheltering sedge,
With misty veil o'erhung! &mdash; Ah, now return!&mdash;
Thy simple tent protects a dearer charge,
Than Cydnus own'd, when erst his trophied urn
Pour'd wavy splendour round that gorgeous barge,
Whose silver oars to Lutes Idalian play'd,
Whose silken streamers Cupid self unfurl'd,
As down his tide the floating pomp convey'd
The boast of love and rival of the world.
