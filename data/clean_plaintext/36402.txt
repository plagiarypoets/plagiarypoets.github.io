&mdash; He laid his side upon the bank,
Making his couch of lily and of rose:
Above him waved its buds a woodbine dank,
Fanning the curls upon his burning brows,
His harp was hung upon its slender boughs;
And ever as the sudden swelling boughs;
Did in its strings the slumbering spirit rouse,
He thought upon his Love, so false and fair,
And to his wan lips pressed her lock of auburn hair.

Now Evening's golden urn o'erflow'd with hues
Of all rare beauty, on the West afar;
And down the sky, encompassed with sweet dews,
Came sailing in its state the Twilight Star;
And on the hills a quivering silver bat
Showed where the Moon was in her cloudy tent,
Waiting until her brother's fiery car
Had plunged within the watery element,
That ever and anon a dying murmur sent.

The Minstrel smiled; and sighed, "O gentle bower,
Within thy shadow ever might I dwell!
Here should I see no Baron's frowning tower,
Nor feel upon my heart the Convent knell,
Where Love and Beauty in some dreary cell
Waste life away, of all its life forlorn,
In agonies not made for words to tell;
Till comes the long, long night without the morn;
And to its earthy bed the broken heart is borne."

A sound was heard in Heaven &mdash; the hurrying clouds
Unfurled their pinions o'er the turbid sea,
As if dark Spirits sat within their shrouds.
Down to its roots was bowed the forest-tree,
The wolf against the wind howled mournfully;
The cloudy armies still came thickening on,
Scaling the mountains till they reach'd the sky&mdash;
Then, like a trumpet's solitary tone,
The thunder gave the sign &mdash; the tempest was begun.

The Minstrel started from his dripping bed,
And looked abroad on Heaven; the lightning-vein
Still left upon the storm its streak of red;
The rain had paused, but heavy strokes were seen
Bursting the solemn thunder-clouds between,
As if, within, the fiery wrath still blazed.
The Ocean lay a sheet of trembling green,
With spots, like floating islands, purple hazed,
Round which with weary sail some wandering vessel mazed.
