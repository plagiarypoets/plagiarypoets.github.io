I left a rose within a lovely bower,
Rearing on polish'd stem its bosom fair,&mdash;
I went my way, and roam'd a little hour,
Then turning sought it, but it was not there;&mdash;
Though I had watch'd it with a florist's care
When its young bloom first woo'd admiring eyes,
And breath'd o'er its unfolding germ, the prayer,&mdash;
And mark'd with grateful hope its beauties rise,
Yielding their smile to earth, their fragrance to the skies.

I ask'd the winds if in their ruffian pride
They on the dust had strew'd those petals rare?
I call'd the blasts and mildews to my side
And question'd each.  They said they might not dare
The spoiler's deed upon a work so fair.&mdash;
But the mild breeze from a far dome convey'd
A strain of joy. &mdash; It said my Rose was there
Bound in a vase of love, &mdash; and so I bade
Within its trembling orb, the selfish tear be stay'd.
