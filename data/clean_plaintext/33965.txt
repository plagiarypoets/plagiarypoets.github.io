O!  could my Strains paint worthily the Queen,
And in my Numbers were her Beauties seen!
Their Harmony, like her sweet Voice, should please,
And they majestic flow, with graceful Ease!
Each happy Verse should Spenser's Song out-shine,
And Gloriana yield to CAROLINE!
Scarce can poetic Wit a Wonder feign,
But what may Credit from thy Virtues gain.
In fragrant Laps the Hours receiv'd Thee first,
And the swath'd Babe the smiling Graces nurst:
On thy new Accents soft Persuasion hung,
And still it glides from that melodious Tongue.
Soon as the Meads thy tender Prints could know,
There spring the Lilies!  there the Roses blow!
There Vi'lets rise, and purple Clusters spread!
True Omens of thy future, Royal Bed! . . .
