When genial Spring's new livery decks the bush,
And her green ensign waves on every tree;
Soon as the lark, the linnet and the thrush,
Pour forth the mingled anthem, MORN!  to thee&mdash;
While murmuring brooks augment the symphony,
And zephyrs scatter odours from their wings,
From Sleep's dull couch, to join the minstrelsy
Of Nature's choristers, the Poet springs:
Then, as around thy rosy herald flings
Light's kindling blushes, Night's dim shades retire&mdash;
The vales rejoice, and every woodland rings,
Responsive to the enthusiastic lyre&mdash;
The mountain casts its misty crown away,
And thee with rapture all the dewy plains survey.

Oh!  there are spells in thy soft whispers, EVE!
When all the din of busy day subsides,
That soothe the soul, and sweet impressions leave,
As lonely musing where some clear stream glides,
Or silent wood extends, the Bard abides,
Watching the rising, haply, of the moon,
Or listening to the distant dashing tides,
Or neighbouring waterfall's symphonious tune.
The bower that Contemplation sought at noon,
When Summer shed her fervid influence round,
And Flora richly with her fragrant boon,
Bedeck'd the bosom of the smiling ground,
Ne'er to the Muse afforded such delight
As she enjoys in thine, mild harbinger of Night!
