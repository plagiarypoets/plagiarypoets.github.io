Who now, amid the City's dust and din
Would pass the irksome day, that can get free,
By sultry streets half smother'd, and hemm'd in
From sight of rural beauty, rural glee?
Hark!  Summer cries &mdash; "Ye captives, fly to me,
My cup of pleasure, see!  is running o'er;
No longer voluntary pris'ners be,
But haste where Health along the breezy shore,
Or winding river, lavishes her store,
And feast till ye are full."  Alas!  in vain
She calls upon the fascinated corps
That business fetters with his magic chain&mdash;
Pale dupes!  at Mammon's shrine they still delay,
Regardless of the charms bright Summer's scenes display.
