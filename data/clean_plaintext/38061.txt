Thrice happy he, whose hours the chearing smiles
Of freedom bless; who wantons uncontroul'd
Where ease invites, or pleasure's syren voice;
Him the stern tyrant with his iron scourge
Annoys not, nor the dire oppressive weight
Of galling chain; but when the blushing morn
Purples the east, with eager transport wild,
O'er hill, o'er valley, on his panting steed
He bounds exulting, as in full career
With horns, and hounds, and thund'ring shouts he drives
The flying stag; or when the dusky shades
Of eve, advancing veil the darkened sky,
To neighb'ring tavern, blithsome, he resorts
With boon companion, where they drown their cares
In sprightly bumpers, and the mantling bowl.

Far otherwise within these darksome walls,
Whose gates, with rows of triple steel secur'd,
And many a bolt, prohibit all egress,
I spend my joyless days; ere dawn appears,
Rous'd from my peaceful slumbers by the sound
Of awe-inspiring bell, whose every stroke
Chills my heart-blood, all trembling, I descend
From dreary garret, round whose ancient roof,
Gaping with hideous chinks, the whistling blast
Perpetual raves, and fierce descending rains
Discharge their fury &mdash; Dire, lethargic dews
Oppress my drowsy sense; still fancy teems
With fond, ideal joys, and, fir'd with what
Or Poets sing, or fabled tale records,
Presents transporting visions; goblets crown'd
With juice of Nectar, or the food divine
Of rich Ambrosia, tempting to the sight!
While in the shade of some embow'ring grove
I lie reclin'd, or through Elysian plains
Enraptur'd stray; where ev'ry plant and flower
Send forth an odorous smell, and all the air
With songs of love and melody resounds.
Meanwhile benumbing cold invades my joints,
As with slow fault'ring footsteps I resort
To where, of antique mold, a lofty dome
Rears its tremendous front; here all at once
From thousand different tongues, a mighty hum
Assaults my ears; loud as the distant roar
Of tumbling torrents; or as in some mart
Of public note, for traffic far renown'd,
Where Jew with Grecian, Turk with African,
Assembled, in one general peal unite
Of dreadful jargon. &mdash; Strait on wooden bench
I take my seat, and conn with studious care
Th' appointed tasks; o'er many a puzzling page
Poring intent, and sage Athenian bard,
With dialect, and mood and tense perplex'd;
And conjunctions varied without end.

When lo!  with haughty stride (in size like him
Who erst extended on the burning lake
Lay floating many a rood;) his sullen brow,
With low'ring frowns and fearful glooms o'ercast,
Enters the Paedagogue; terrific sight!
An ample ninefold peruke, spread immense,
Luxuriant waving down his shoulders plays;
His hand a bunch of limber twigs sustains,
Call'd by the vulgar Birch, tartarean  root,
Whose rankling points, in blackest poison dipt,
Inflict a mortal pain; and, where they light,
A ghastly furrow leave. &mdash; Scar'd at the sight,
The bustling multitude, with anxious hearts,
Their stations seek. &mdash; A solemn pause ensues;
As when, of old, the monarch of the floods,
'Midst raging hurricanes, and battling waves,
Shaking the dreadful Trident, rear'd aloft
His awful brow. &mdash; Sudden the furious winds
Were hush'd in peace, the billows ceas'd their rage:
Or when, (if mighty themes, like these, allow
An humble metaphor) the sportive race
Of nibbling heroes, bent on wanton play,
Beneath the shelter of some well-stor'd barn,
In many an airy circle wheel around;
Some eye, perchance, in private nook conceal'd,
Beholds GRIMALKIN; instant they disperse,
In headlong flight, each to his secret cell;
If haply he may 'scape impending fate.

Thus ceas'd the gen'ral clamour, all remain
In silent terror wrapt, and thought profound.

Meanwhile, the Paedagogue throughout the dome
His fiery eyeballs, like two blazing stars,
Portentous rolls, on some unthinking wretch,
To shed their baleful influence; whilst his voice
Like thunder, or the cannon's sudden burst,
Three times is heard, and thrice the roofs resound!
A sudden paleness gathers in my face;
Through all my limbs a stiff'ning horror spread,
Cold as the dews of death, nor heed my eyes
Their wonted function, but in stupid gaze
Ken the fell monster; from my trembling hands
The thumb-worn volume drops; oh dire presage
Of instant woe!  for now the mighty sound
Pregnant with dismal tidings, once again
Strikes my astonish'd ears.  Transfix'd with awe,
And senseless, for a time, I stand; but soon,
By friendly jog, or neigh'bring whisper rous'd,
Obey the dire injunction; strait I loose
Depending brogues, and mount the lofty throne
Indignant, or the back of oblique ascend
Of sorrowful compeer; nor long delays
The Monarch, from his palace stalking down,
With visage all inflam'd; his sable robe
Sweeping in length'ning folds along the ground:
He shakes his sceptre, and the impending scourge
Brandishes high; nor tears nor shrieks avail;
But with impetuous fury it descends,
Imprinting horrid wounds, with fatal flow
Of blood attended, and convulsive pangs.

Curst be the wretch, for ever doom'd to bear
Infernal whippings; he, whose savage hands
First grasp'd these barbarous weapons, bitter cause
Of foul disgrace, and many a dolorous groan,
To hapless school-boy. &mdash; Could it not suffice
I groan'd and toil'd beneath the merc'less weight,
By stern relentless tyranny impos'd,
But scourges too, and cudgels were reserv'd
To goad my harrow'd sides:  This wretched life
Loading with heavier ills; a life expos'd
To all the woes of hunger, toil, distress;
Cut off from ev'ry genial source of bliss;
From ev'ry bland amusement, wont to soothe
The youthful breast; except when father Time,
In joyful change, rolls round the festive hour,
That gives this meagre, pining figure, back
To parent fondness, and its native roofs.
Fir'd with the thought, then, then my tow'ring soul
Rises superior to its load, and spurns
Its proud oppressors; frantic with delight,
My fancy riots in successive scenes
Of bliss and pleasures:  plans and schemes are laid
How best the fleeting moments to improve,
Nor lose one portion of so rare a boon.

But soon, too soon, these glorious scenes are fled,
Scarce one short moon enjoy'd, (oh!  transient state
Of sublunary bliss) by bitter change,
And other scenes succeeded, what fierce pangs
Then rack my soul; what ceaseless floods of grief,
Rush down my cheeks, while strong convulsive throbs
Heave all my frame, and choak the power of speech.
Forlorn I sigh, nor heed the gentle voice
Of friend or stranger, who, with soothing words,
And slender gift, would fain beguile my woes:
In vain; for what can aught avail to soothe
Such raging anguish!  Oft with sudden glance
Before my eyes in all its horrors glares
That well-known form, and oft I seem to hear
The thund'ring scourge &mdash; Ah me!  e'en now I feel
Its deadly venom, raging at the pangs
That tore Alcides, when the burning vest
Prey'd on his wasted sides. &mdash; At length return'd
Within these hated walls, again I mourn
A sullen pris'ner, 'till the wish'd approach
Of joyous holiday or festive play
Releases me:  ah!  freedom that must end
With thee, declining Sol; all hail, ye sires
For sanctity renown'd, whose glorious names
In large conspicuous characters pourtray'd,
Adorn the annual chronologic page
Of Wing or Partridge; oft when sore opprest
With dire calamities, the glad return
Of your triumphant festivals, hath chear'd
My drooping soul; nor be thy name forgot,
Illustrious George, for much to thee I owe
Of heart-felt rapture, as with loyal zeal
Glowing, I pile the crackling bonfire high,
Or hurl the mounting rocket thro' the air,
Or fiery whizzing serpent; thus my name
Shall still be honour'd, as thro' future years
The circling seasons roll their festive round.

Sometimes, by dire compulsive hunger press'd,
I spring the neighb'ring fence, and scale the trunk
Of apple-tree; or wide, o'er flow'ry lawns,
By hedge or thicket, bend my hasty steps,
Intent, with secret ambush, to surprize
The straw-built nest, and unsuspecting brood
Of Thrush or Bullfinch; oft with watchful ken
Eyeing the backward lawns, lest hostile glance
Observe my footsteps, while each rustling leaf,
Stirr'd by the gentle gale, alarms my fears:
Then, parch'd beneath the burning heats of noon,
I plunge into the limpid stream, that laves
The silent vale, or on its grassy banks
Beneath some oak's majestic shade, recline;
Envying the vagrant fishes, as they pass
Their boon of freedom; 'till the distant sound
Of toiling Curfew warns me to depart.

Thus under tyrant power I groan, oppress'd
With worse than slavery; yet my free-born soul
Her native warmth forgets not, nor will brook
Menace or taunt from proud insulting peer:
But summons to the field the doughty foe
In single combat, 'midst th' impartial throng,
There to decide our fate.  Oft too enflam'd
With mutual rage, two rival armies meet
Of youthful warriors; kindling at the sight,
My soul is fill'd with vast heroic thoughts,
Trusting, in martial glory, to surpass
Roman or Grecian chief; instant, with shouts
The mingling squadrons join the horrid fray;
No need of cannon, or the murd'rous steel,
Wide-wasting; nature, rage our arms supplies. 
Fragments of rocks are hurl'd, and showers of stones
Obscure the day; nor less the brawny arm,
Or knotted club avail:  high in the midst
Are seen the mighty Chiefs, thro' hosts of foes
Mowing their way; and now, with tenfold rage,
The combat burns, full many a sanguine stream
Distains the field, and many a veteran brave
Lies prostrate; loud triumphant shouts ascend
By turns from either host; each claims the palm
Of glorious conquest; nor till night's dun shades
Involve the sky, the doubtful conflict ends.

Thus when rebellion shook the thrones of heav'n,
And all th' eternal powers in battle met,
High o'er the rest, with vast gigantic strides,
The godlike leaders, on th' embattled plain,
Came tow'ring, breathing forth revenge and fate;
Nor less terrific join'd the inferior hosts
Of angel warriors, when encount'ring hills,
Tore the rent concave, &mdash; flashing with the blaze
Of fiery arms, and lightnings, not of Jove;
All heav'n resounded, and th' astonish'd deeps
Of chaos bellow'd with the monstrous roar.
