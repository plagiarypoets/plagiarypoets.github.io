With Angels face and brightness,
And orient hue, fair Oriana shining,
With nimble foote she tripped o're hils and mountains,
Hard by Diana's fountains.
At last in dale she rested.
This is that maiden Queen of Fairie land,
With sceptre in her hand.
The fauns and satyrs dancing,
Did show their nimble lightness.
Fair Nais and the nymphs leave their bowers,
And brought their baskets full of herbs and flowers.
Then sang the shepherds and nymphs of Diana:
Long live fair Oriana.
