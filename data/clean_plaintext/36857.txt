While ither bards in strains far mair sublime
Strike from their heaven-born harps celestial fire,
And listening crowds adore the dulcet chime,
That sweetly vibrates from each sounding wire,
I, to beguile "the whips and scorns of time,"
To simplest notes attune my simple lyre,
Content enough to spin my hamely rhyme,
Though fient a body's near me to admire&mdash;
Ah!  could I please mysel', 'twould be my hale desire.

Nae marvellous feat inspires my lowly lay&mdash;
Nae doughty deed achieved by single arm,
When knights and barons bold, in ancient day,
Waded through seas o' blude in feudal 'larm;
But just, as mither Nature leads the way,
And smiles a genial smile on ilka charm,
The rural loves, and eke the rural play,
That rustic breasts invigorate and warm
I sing, &mdash; and sure sic sangs can ne'er do mickle harm.

The hairst was ended, and the reapers set
Around the supper-board, in merry pin,
Whan collie heard a footstep at the yett,
Whilk to the barkin' gart the beast begin.
Cried the gudeman, haste som o' ye, an' let
The bodie through, an' mind an' bring him in,
Whae'er he be &mdash; this night wi' us he'll get
A share o' a' &mdash; the aged, lame, or blin',
Why should we grudge to feed, since heaven so kind hath bin?"

Wat brattled out wi' speed, an' soon return'd
Leading a veteran bleach'd wi' crazy eild,
Whase bosom, erst, with valor's fire had burn'd&mdash;
Whase blude had flow'd on many a battle field;
But with his fiddle now his food he earn'd
Amang the poor, for rich men's hearts were steel'd&mdash;
Oft from the lordly dwelling was he spurn'd&mdash;
But when he reach'd the peasant's lowly bield,
A shelter frae the storm it aye was sure to yield.

They welcomed him wi' joy, an' kindly bade
Him doff his weary wallets, an' sit doun;
An' whan the grace was reverently said,
The gaucie gudewife rax'd him owre a spoon,
An' tauld him to win to, for he was made
As welcome as the brawest 'bout the toun,
And that it gied her joy to ease his lade
O' care:  besides, she'd count it as a boon,
Gin he wad freely share her cruds an' bannocks broun.

He thankit her, an' said he'd do his best;
An' now behold how thrang they're ane an' a'&mdash;
Deil tak the silly sump that time wad waste,
An' no wi' siccan food supply his maw.
Wat, wha wi' manners scrimpitly was blest,
Whyles stoppit short an' gied a great gaffa;
But ilka youthy being in sic haste,
They didna halt to rally him ava,
But plied their green ram's horns, an' cu'd the kirn awa'.

An' whan their kytes were fill'd, they ilka ane
Agreed to sport the evening in a dance&mdash;
Then forthwith to the barn, a' fidgin' fain,
To redd the floor, the younkers 'gan to prance.
Till ilka lad his dearest joe had ta'en,
Wat sat, and e'ed them a' wi' looks askance;
Syne raise an' catch'd Meg by the shekelbane,
An' led her out, an' smack'd her i' the trance,
Fu' proud to think that he had gotten sic a chance.

Meanwhile the canty carles their seats bedeen,
Drew in beside a blythely bleezing fire,
An' mony a winding tale they tauld, I ween,
Which, to rehearse, your ears would only tire.
But when they changed the ever-shifting scene
To fields where armies meet in all their ire,
Flash'd vivid lightning frae the sodger's een&mdash;
His bosom's chords trilled like a minstrel's lyre&mdash;
Their every throb a slave with feedom might inspire.

Then to the wondering runkled rustic band
He bared his honest scars, with manly pride;
For he had bled in Egypt's distant land
When gallant Abercrombie fought and died;
And on its burning, broiling, blistering sand,
When rear'd around the battle's dreadful tide,
His arm had waved on high the gory brand
Whilst clouds sulphureous, rolling far and wide,
Both heaven and earth with one black pall did hide.

Next how the welcome word he heard it given,
Old Scotia's rocky regions to explore,
And how his soul with pain was rack'd and riven
To leave the land that gave him birth once more&mdash;
How Gallia's hosts to darksome death were driven,
And how our own loved hero, dauntless Moore,
Fell, like a star-beam from the vault of heaven,
On red Corunna's carcase-cover'd shore,
He told, whilst trickling tears his wither'd cheeks ran o'er.

But whisht, Wat's at the door &mdash; he loudly cries
Mak haste, an' come awa', the barn floor's redd.
Then to his boon compeers he quickly flies,
An' tells them owre an' owre the words he said.
But scarcely had they a' in gleesome guise
Themselves in dancing order ready made,
Whan swith the gaberlunzie met their eyes,
Wrapt in the very regimental plaid
He wore when drest with kilt, plumed-bonnet, and cockade.

They gently heezed him on a mow o' strae
Whare at his ease he blythsomely did lig
An' play'd them monie a sweet, weel-kend strathspey,
An' monie a merry reel an' jirgin jig;
And aye 'tween ilka spring, ane bltyth an' gay,
They handit him wi' joy a jovial jug
O' reamin yill, or horn o' usquahae,
Whilk gart him raise his shouther to his lug,
An' fidge an' laugh fu' fain to think his lot sae snug.

The auld anes by a bunker blythly sat
An' drank gude liquor till they maist ware ree;
They warna vera slack, right weel, I wat,
At sweeling doun bale bickerfu's o' bree&mdash;
An' while the younkers by them bab'd an' swat,
They aye sent round John Barley's blude wi' glee;
An' leugh at this, an' made remarks on that,
O wow but they were blest as blest could be&mdash;
It was a gladsome sight the canty cocks to see.

A youthfu' pair blooming in beauty's pride,
To wham thae rustic sports were nearhan' stale,
Slipt out unseen, and lightsomely did glide
With fairy footsteps down the dowy dale.
While night's fair empress like a buxom bride
Away, away, alang the sky did sail;
They by the murmuring streamlet's haunted side
Sincerely whisper'd o'er their artless tale&mdash;
A truer ne'er was told in any Scottish vale.

Oh heaven!  it is a bonnie thing to see
The downy god, with his connubial chart,
Piloting young souls onward, modestly,
To holy hymen's matrimonial mart;
And sweet affection look wi' kindly e'e
Upon its dearer, better, lovelier part,
When frae the wanton wiles o' lewdness free
Heart innocently concentrates in heart&mdash;
And when the tongue plays wag the naked soul doth start.

Their bosoms eased, their spirits bounding glad,
Again they join'd the mirth-continuing core,
Where ilka leesome lilt that now was led
Seem'd ten times sweeter than it did before;
Till auld an' young, man, widow, wife, an' maid,
Enraptured and inspired at ilka pore,
Flang age an' care and bashfu'ness aside,
An' ranced an' pranced, an' sported on the floor&mdash;
A blyther scene, I ween, we'll never witness more.

But frae them a' Wat bure awa' the gree
For wallopin', an' caperin', an' flingin';
He lap as though he had a mind to flee,
Ye've seenil i' yer life e'er seen sic springin'.
An' then there ware sae muckle mirth an' glee&mdash;
Sic hoochin', hotchin', loupin', laughin', dingin'&mdash;
Auld echo, roostit 'mang the kebars hie,
Swore baith his lugs right merrily ware ringin'&mdash;
An weel they might, though deaf as those o' cobler Lingan.

Thus unperceived the moments sleely staw
Till e'ening's latest hour was flying fleet,
And the gudeman proposed that they should a'
Their fun an' frolic timeously forleet.
But ere they jeed or offer'd to gae wa'
They thocht it wad be wise their craigs to weet;
An' whan the cup was toom'd by grit an' sma'
Upon his sides the cock his grey wings beat,
And with his bougil shrill the morning hour did greet.

Then ilka swankie singled out his ain
Lass, and awa' wi' her fu' kindly sped,
An' left the auld focks cannily alane
To tak' their wee bit crack an' gang to bed.
Oh!  sleep, thy balmy blessings on them rain,
And never let them lie with restless head;
And never let the friend of the o'er-labor'd swain,
Although thou shun'st the down-couch canopied
With costly trappings, and with golden gems array'd.

Sweet, rural life, thou hast a charm unknown
To courts and camps with all their pageantry;
Thou hast a native charm that is thine own&mdash;
Nor can be found amid the revelry
Of crowded cities.  But the days are gone
When I, light-hearted on the daisied lee,
Have bask'd among thy flowers so wildly strown;
Those days are fled, and I no more must see
Thy harmless, happy feats of blythe festivity.

No more my bleeding breast with joy shall swell,
I cannot conjure back departed rime;
Relentless fate hath long since rung the knell
Of all my pleasures; and this goodly clime,
Embroider'd o'er with flowers, wood, dale, and dell,
Lake, mountain, rock, and cataract sublime,
That in my youth wrought like a magic spell
Upon my passions, rousing them to rhyme
And rapture, must I now forego in manhood's prime.

Adieu, adieu, the hamlet and the cot&mdash;
Adieu the sweeping plain and heathery hill&mdash;
Where ere I dreamt how hard would be my lot,
My vagrant footsteps wander'd at their will.
Adieu!  the green graves where my fathers rot,
The glen, the glade, the meadow, and the rill;
While memory lasts forget ye shall I not,
Your images will haunt my bosom till
My red blood cease to flow, my heart be cold and still.
