To the woods and the groves I'll complain,
I'll sing to the echo alone,
For mankind but sport with my pain,
And laugh at my amorous moan:
But no peace can their jeerings impart,
Nor their laughter my sorrows remove,
&mdash;Ah me!  how contracted the heart,
Till refin'd and expanded by love!

No swain was more jocund than I,
To mirth I devoted the day;
But now to the breezes I sigh,
And breathe out my sorrowful lay:
How sad and how lonely the scene!
What a change has the grove undergone!
No joys can I find on the green,
For, alas!  my FLORELLA is gone!

She's gone &mdash; ah, there's death in the sound!
She's gone &mdash; and her absence I mourn:
I will dig me a cave in the ground,
I will weep till FLORELLA return.
O ye linnets, give over your lay,
And abroad let the nightingale stroll,
With the stock-dove I'll groan thro' the day,
And at night I'll lament with the owl.

A chaplet of willow I'll twine,
(Meet garb for the shepherd that mourns,)
But in trappings more gaudy I'll shine,
When my faithful FLORELLA returns:
Then haste, lovely maid!  to the grove,
And thy swain from his cloister release;
One glance all his pains will remove,
One smile will recover his ease.
