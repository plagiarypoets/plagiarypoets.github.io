Haste, young-eyed May!  and gently pour
From bosom green thy balmy store:
Bid violets paint their azure beds,
And daffodils with bending heads,
And tulip gilt, and primrose fair
Sweetly catch the laughing air.
Bring Joy along, thy eldest born,
And Plenty with her flowing horn;
Whilst Birds of many a various wing
To Cam in wildest woodnotes sing,
Who sees approach his sedgy Throne
The State's great Patron, and his own.

Hail, PELHAM by whose fav'rite hand
Peace yet strews olive round the land:
See, EUROPE's groans betray despair;
Her trembling Ballance asks thy care:
And if no human art can guide
The pendant weight on either side,
If sacred GEORGE at length shall cease
To bid the world be blest in Peace,
Of crowns in vain shall Lewis dream;
His scale shall mount, and kick the beam.

Whence then, Britannia, the big tear,
Lest Song detain thy Patriot's ear?
His noble breast at once is free
To guard the well-lov'd Muse, and Thee.
See, Learning marks his chosen way
With many a beam of early day;
And louring Ignorance gives place
To Science, with averted Face;
Whilst PELHAM bids the column rise,
And tell his bounty to the skies.
Now smiles old Cam, and scatter'd finds
His Gothic dust the sport of winds;
Nor envy Isis, who erewhile
Boasted her Mausolean Pile.
On Domes depends not PELHAM's name:
But be They founded on His fame!
Haste, ye Muses, to prepare,
Sweet flowrets for your Guardian's hair;
Beneath His banner safe engage,
And brave the Vandals of the age.
For Him your choicest lawrels bring,
Who lifts ev'n Me on Fancy's wing:
For Him let Nature's face be gay,
All be mirth, and holyday!
But when the ruddy Eve steals on,
And tips the grove with mantle brown;
When swings the solemn Curfeu slow,
Far absent be, thou Bird of woe!
Nor close the day with hoarseness drear,
This fairest daughter of the year!
