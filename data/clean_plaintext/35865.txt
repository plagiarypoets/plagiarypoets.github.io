Scotch fiddle, fare the well!  the night dogs bark,
Their wild notes with thy drowsy tones are blending,
Rouse from his reverie som boozy spark,
From porter-house or tavern homeward wending;
Resume thy case again, thou wantest mending,
And thy worn strings make droning minstrelsy;
The squeaking tone with city vespers blending,
Mixe with the distant hum of nightly glee,
In drowsy concert sleepy maketh me.

Yet once again, farewel, Scotch fiddle dear
(For dear thou art to those that buy thy lay)
Ah!  little recked I of thy tones so clear,
That scare love making catlings far away.
How often have I scraped whole nights away,
And murdered tunes the world hath never known;
What time to dancing wights and damsels gay,
I tuned thy strings, and fiddled all alone:
That I survive these nights, sweet fiddle, is thine own.

Hark!  as my lingering footsteps slow retire,
Some airy minstrel wakes thy worn out string!
'Tis Church's ghost, come from Tartarean fire!
"Scotch ointment," stead of rosin pure he brings.
And hark!  how sweet th' annointed fiddle rings!
Fainter and fainter in receding swell,
As the pure spirit spreads his singed wings,
My fingers itch to play the wizard spell,
But 'twill not be &mdash; SCOTCH FIDDLE, fare the well!
