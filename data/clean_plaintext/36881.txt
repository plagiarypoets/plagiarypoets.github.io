Say tender partner of my piercing woes,
Dear, ever honour'd Auth'ress of my birth;
Whose heart too frequent fill'd with painful throes,
On my account is seldom us'd to mirth.
Say, why when all false hearted friends are gone,
Do you alone regard your poor ill fated son?

Say when with riches and the sweets of peace,
Your ev'ry want might well have been supply'd,
Why did you turn aside from wealth and ease;
Why were those precious gifts by you deny'd?
While rather than enjoy them far from me,
You chose to share my woes involv'd in penury.

'Twas sure because your spirit could disdain,
Those gilded baits which venal souls entice,
You rather chose to act aright with pain,
Than live tho' rich a slave to pride and vice.
For this you fled with your ill fated son,
To save with kind advice his virtues near undone.

To chear in want my poor desponding heart,
In sickness to support my drooping head,
In straits a real friend to share a part,
In health a scanty meal with joy to spread.
Those cares you chose &mdash; instead of fading toys,
And you for those at last will reap immortal joys.

Here too on earth some blessings you may prove,
For virtue can the place of wealth supply;
Blest with my grateful thanks and duteous love:
Your age on my fond care may safe rely.
And if kind providence should bless my ways,
Your latter shall outshine by far your earlier days.

But can I e'er for learning you repay,
Which aids the muse to chear my lonesome hours,
The muse that makes gaunt penury look gay;
That fires to extacy my drooping powr's,
Blest parent!  that so wisely could provide,
For that which comforts me whatever ills betide.

Spirits divine!  Protectors of the just,
For this and ev'ry gift my parent guard;
To your strict care her footsteps I entrust:
Oh guide her safely to a bright reward.
Where sad affliction can no longer sway,
But where all woes are lost in everlasting day!
