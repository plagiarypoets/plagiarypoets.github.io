If ever I have scorn'd thy sacred pow'r,
And wrong'd thy nature gentle, kind, and sweet,
Or e'er refus'd the off'ring of a flow'r
To deck the sod of thine enshrin'd retreat,&mdash;
Oh, dearest Cupid!  suppliant at thy feet,
I now the crime implore thee to forgive;
And listen, while the vow I here repeat,
Thee to adore, long as thy name shall live,
Or thou one ardent vot'ry, gracious wilt receive!

Thou art not cruel, false, capricious, wild;
Thy nature is indulgent, and benign:
While innocent and artless as a child,
Yet high matur'd intelligence is thine,
And on thy brow, truth and fair honour shine:
Benevolence and tenderness appear
In ev'ry smile that lights thy face divine;
And in thy sweet eye's floating lustrous tear,
Dwells a soft, sacred charm, to virtue fondly dear.

Oh!  when my heart has left thy pure domain,
Incautious, unsuspecting, led to rove
O'er vanity, or folly's painted plain,
Or lur'd by murmurs soft, of flattery's grove,
E'en then, thou hast not left, forgiving Love,
Thy undeserving, and neglectful child;
But by each tender winning art, hast strove
To lure again the wanderer beguil'd,
And charm, and fix, by thine endearments mild.

Oh, I am thine &mdash; for ever, ever thine!
On thee for ev'ry hope I now rely;
The fond enthusiast bends before the shrine,
And visions bright as clouds on ev'ning sky
Beholds entranc'd, with fix'd enchanted eye.
Oh, Love!  with thee for ever could I rest;
Far from the world, and its delusions fly;
And, like a bird within her downy nest,
Repose in shelter safe, my panting, wearied breast!
