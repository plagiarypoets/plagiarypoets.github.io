Ye Maids of Pindus!  damosels divine!
Enravish'd with your soul-enchanting lore,
I dedicate myself unto your shrine:
Ah, maids of Pindus!  say, can I do more?
And every moment lost will I deplore
That I pass not in your sequester'd shades,
And never, until I shall be no more,
Will cease to love you, O celestial maids!
For your's alone is that which never fades,
The ever-blooming beauty of the mind,
Unemblem'd by the flow'rs that deck the glades,
Whose beauties perish in the wintry wind.
Maids of the deathless song and golden lyre!
Aonian Muses!  then your bard inspire!
