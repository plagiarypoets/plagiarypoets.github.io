Otway had never starved in such a clime:
The peasants would have crowned him; their quick eyes'
Intelligent purpose, mellow voices' chime
Have drunk the beaming brightness of their skies;
Thus, beauty never there neglected lies:
The swift perception of what exquisite grows,&mdash;
The variegated woof which nature dies
With myriad colours; or the thought which flows
Through the worn poet's breast, reflected in them, glows.
