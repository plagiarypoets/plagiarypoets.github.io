Ye were a group of stars collected here,
Some, mildly glowing, others sparkling bright;
Here rising in a region calm and clear,
Ye shone awhile with intermingled light;
Then parting, each pursuing his own flight
O'er the wide hemisphere, ye singly shone;
But ere ye climbed to half your promised height,
Ye sunk again with brightening glory round you thrown,
Each left a brilliant track as each expired alone.

And now, ye live, above the starry spheres,
In sweet communion with the pure and blest;
Ye know no earthly change of hopes and fears,
But all is one unbroken heaven of rest,
An ocean, with no wave on all its breast.
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Ye dwell in love and feast upon high truth,
And share, in that bright world beyond the tomb,
Unwasting vigour, and unfading youth,
A cherub's beauty and a seraph's bloom;
Ye err not, mourn not, fear no day of doom;
Within your breast there's nought to wake one sigh,
Across your brow there comes no shade of gloom;
The tear is wiped forever from your eye,
And all your souls are filled with rapture pure and high.
