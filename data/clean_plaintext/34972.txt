Is there a joy that gilds our stormy days,
For which the soul of man so much should pine
As heaven-born knowledge?  But her sacred rays
Are as the diamonds, and by art must shine;
The beams of light more exquisitely fine
In some of highest worth, but all require
The artist's hand, or lost the blaze divine,
Ordain'd to kindle each refin'd desire
Which shall to all that's fair, and great, and good, aspire.

While yet unknown the principles of art,
Then still unseen, unfelt its charms so rare;
If sottish Ignorance surrounds the heart,
No beauty can pervade the darkness drear,
But all as colours to the blind appear;
Where Pleasure's tint, "celestial rosy red,"
Majestic purple, scarlet, (hue of war)
The undulating mantle of the mead,
And Heaven's gay robe, a dark, unmingled mass is spread.

But not alone perfection to discern,
And sport delighted in her subtle maze,
Pursue we knowledge, and her precepts learn;
She fires the soul with gen'rous thirst of praise,
And conscious elevation guards her ways.
Awaken'd, delicate, each low pursuit,
Each gross desire, whate'er the heart betrays
To vanity or vice, shunn'd as the fruit
Of deadliest plant, can ne'er th' enlighten'd mind pollute.

In man there is a principle innate,
Of rest incapable, and good, or ill,
Low, or exalted, he must love or hate,
And one dear purpose of the soul fulfil,
As early choice, to habit grown, shall will;
If with the matin lark his plumed wings
He not expand, and with him soaring still
To Wisdom's sun, whence light and beauty beam,
He sinks in murky caves, where owls and ravens scream.

Soft Sensibility, with beauteous mien,
That never fails to visit youthful breast,
Resisted, chill'd, avoids the frigid scene,
Dully unworthy of so dear a guest.
She flies, and with her flies whatever bless'd
The human soul, fair subjects of her pow'r,
Taste in all Art and Nature's beauties dress'd,
Each social tenderness, whose thrilling store
Alone can give the heart one truly blissful hour.

Youth is Life's spring, the seed-time when the mind
Fosters each new idea planted there;
If we neglect to sow the grain refin'd,
No future pains can raise a harvest fair;
And memory, warm and soft in early year,
As yielding wax, diffus'd, grows cold and hard,
Nor aught retains of each impression rare;
Which when retain'd, acquire the high reward
Bestow'd by star-crown'd Fame on timely studious Bard.
