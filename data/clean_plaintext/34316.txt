The barks how fam'd, by lab'ring oars
Innumberable driv'n to Phyrgian shores!
The blue-ey'd NEREID'S danc'd in jocund rounds,
The dolphin, by harmonious sounds,
Captiv'd, in gambols flounc'd along the main,
All as ACHILLES sail'd to Troy's ill-destin'd plain.

The Nymphs, Euboea's strand forsook,
Their route thro' Pelion's sacred mountain took;
A massy shield, with curious sculpture wrought,
From VULCAN'S golden forge they brought,
Seeking, where PELEUS rear'd thee, swift of pace,
Thee, THETIS' sea-born son, ACHILLES, pride of Greece.

The shield (so whilom did relate
A wight return'd from Ilion's hapless fate)
Was with a various-figur'd group bespred:
There PERSEUS shook the Gorgan head,
Soaring with winged feet, as o'er the sea
With MAIA'S peerless son, JOVE'S herald, he did flee.

Full in the midst with dazzling blaze
The sun's bright orb shot forth his golden rays,
And all around the starry host appear,
Glist'ring, as in the heav'nly sphere:
Such ardent light fierce HECTOR could affray,
HECTOR, estrang'd to fear, appall with dire dismay.

High on the helmet were display'd
Rich images emboss'd, with gold inlaid;
There with destructive grasp her trembling prey
A SPHINX exulting bore away;
There fell CHIMAERA with impetuous force,
And breathing fire, rush'd on the Pirenaean horse.

Sublime in his triumphant car,
ACHILLES press'd amid the thickest war;
The generous steeds flew prancing o'er the plain,
And champing foam'd with proud disdain;
Whilst, as he brandish'd high his deadly spear,
Thick clouds of dust arose, and darken'd all the rear.

Such chieftains on th' embattled plain
Own'd great ATRIDES' sway, who basely slain
By TYNDARIS, lewd partner of his bed,
At home, in peace, ignobly bled:
Nathless thy murd'rous wiles shalt thou deplore,
When 'neath th' avenging steel shall stream thy purple gore.
