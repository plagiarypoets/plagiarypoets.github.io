COLIN CLOUTES MOURNFULL DITTIE FOR THE DEATH OF ASTROPHELL.

Sheepheards that wont on pipes of Oaten reede,
Oft-times to plaine your loves concealed smart;
And with your pitteous Layes have learn'd to breede
Compassion in a Country-Lasses hart:
Hearken ye gentle Sheepheards to my song,
And place my dolefull plaint your plaints among.

To you alone I sing this mournfull verse,
The mournfull verse that everman heard tell:
To you whose softned harts it may emperse
With dolours dart for death of Astrophell.
To you I sing, and to none other wight:
For well I wot, my rimes been rudely dight.

Yet as they been, if any nicer wit
Shall hap to heare, or covet them to reade:
Thinke he, that such are for such ones most fit,
Made not to please the living, but the dead.
And if in him found pitty ever place;
Let him be moov'd to pitty such a case.
Edm. Spencer.
