My Jockey is fled from the plain,
And left me in sorrow to mourn;
Was ever so cruel a swain?
Ah, when will the rover return?
No longer he pipes on his reed,
No longer his praises I'll tell;
Yet dull are the banks of the Tweed
Since Jockey has bid them farewel.

His crook he has broken in twain,
His sheep and his lambkins now stray;
They bleat for their master in vain,
And carelessly wander away:
Then haste thee some shepherd so free,
And call the poor flocks to their home.
O!  be to them kinder than he,
Who caus'd the dear wand'rers to roam.

Each virgin so happy and gay,
Attend to the words I impart;
Be careful and cautious I pray,
How you give a young shepherd your heart.
Though Jockey was rural and neat,
To me was most loving and kind,
His manners were gentle and sweet,
'Till cruelty grew in his mind.
