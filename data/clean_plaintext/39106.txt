Here high suspended on a gibbet hangs
A youth to ev'ry vice and plunder prone,
Till caught at length by Law's resistless fangs,
He found his thieving occupation gone.

Bad were his sentiments, his actions worse,
And when he mounted Newgate's fatal drop,
He gave the hangman a most hearty curse,
From him he got, what he deserv'd, a rope.
