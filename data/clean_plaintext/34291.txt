Fair pearl-crown'd Nymph, whose gushing Torrent laves
This marble Rock with hollow-tinkling Waves;
Who wont'st in secret Solitude to dwell,
On Coral Beds beneath thy Sapphire Cell,
Whose Virgin-Pow'r can break the magic Charm,
Whose Look the black Enchanter's Hand disarm;
Whom Swains in neighb'ring Vales to sing delight,
Kind Guardian of their Flocks from blasting Sprite;
Permit me, Goddess, from thy silver Lake,
With cooling Draught my glowing Thirst to slake!
So, when thou bath'st, may no rude Satyr's Eye,
From some deep Brake thy naked Beauties spy:
May no chill Blast the ivied Oak invade,
That o'er thy Cavern waves his solemn Shade.
