What shrieks burst through the murky air!
The voice of horror sounds again,
And, lo!  encircled by his daemon train,
The black, grim-visag'd genius of DESPAIR!

Yonder he stands! &mdash; around him wait,
In all the pomp of sullen state,
Remorse and Guilt, whose troubled breast
Hope's flattering gales ne'er lull to rest,
While Conscience acts the torturer's part,
And gnaws with venom'd stings their heart.

And there &mdash; while DANGER'S giant form
Stalks through the horrors of the hurtling storm,
Whose voice what mortal unappall'd can hear!
Shivers aghast the phantom FEAR.
There MADNESS too, whose shatter'd hair
Wildly streaming mocks the air;
His blood-shot eye-balls sparkle fire,
And burst with ineffectual ire,
While still by fits he shakes his hundred chains,
Loud laughs with ghastly grin, or roars along the plains.

By the flitting gleams of light
Appears what yet escap'd my sight!
Ah!  see the self-devoted band!
Each grasps a poniard in his hand!
With banning voice, that rends the sky,
They call DESPAIR!  DESPAIR is nigh.
Far from the realms of cheerful day,
The night-born chieftain leads the way.
High on yon cliff, whose beetling brow
Frowns o'er the gulph of death below,
Awhile they stand.  Hell's ravening brood,
That glut their thirst with human blood,
Catching quick the tainted gale,
The promis'd feast in harsh screams hail:
Prelusive lightenings dart around,
And bellowing thunders shake the ground:
Amidst the elemental shock,
They deeply strike the sudden blow,
Then plunge them headlong from the rock
Into the torrent tide, that whelms its prey below.
