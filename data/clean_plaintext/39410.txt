Why when the storm is up, and winds are loud,
And the hoarse heavy torrent dashes down,
Why seems my spirit joyful and unbowed,
Why am I oppressed by Nature's frown?
Is it because in my seared heart hath grown
Strange sympathy with tempest and with gloom?
Or is it that when joy was most my own
That joy no heavenly radiance did illume,
And even when brightest seemed to breathe but of the tomb?

Even as the war-note to the warrior's ear,
Comes with a full and spirit-stirring charm,
So comes to mine, even when most severe,
And when most fit the feeble to alarm;
So comes to mine, as if devoid of harm,
Approaching winter's wild and wayward blast!
And though I love the summer's gentle calm,
Yet all so darkly hath my fate been cast,
I hail more fondly still the storm-encircled waste.
