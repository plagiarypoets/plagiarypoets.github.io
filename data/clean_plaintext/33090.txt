A shadie Wood, pourtraicted to the sight,
With uncouth pathes, and hidden waies unknowne:
Resembling CHAOS, or the hideous night,
Or those sad Groves, by banke of ACHERON
With banefull Ewe, and Ebon overgrowne:
Whose thickest boughtes, and inmost entries are
Not peirceable, to power of any starre.

Thy Imprese SILVIUS, late I did devise,
To warne the what (if not) thou oughtst to be,
Thus inward close, unsearch'd with outward eies,
With thousand angles, light should never see:
For fooles that most are open-hearted free,
Unto the world, their weakenes doe bewray,
And to the net, the first themselves betray.
