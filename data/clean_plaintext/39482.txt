Hell is the region where I first drew breath;
Sin is my victim, and my sport is death.
To vex the tenants of this earthly ball
I issued forth, exulting, at the fall;
Tortur'd by me, the miscreant eyes the past
With rage, and feels no ray of hope at last.
I scorn the calm that pure repentance brings,
And arm the conscience with immortal stings;
Round the lorn wretch a thousand forms of dread
Hover all day, and haunt at night his bed.
Swift at my call a host of fiends appear:
Hark!  how they bellow in the troubled air!
Appal'd, amaz'd, the wretch infuriate glares,
And wildly on the horrid prospect stares:
His former deeds, alas!  of murky hue,
Arise, in dread array, before his view;&mdash;
His brain grows giddy, he invokes despair!
I come:  I seize him by his flowing hair;
And, as convuls'd his madd'ning eye-balls roll,
Present the dagger, or the poison'd bowl.
