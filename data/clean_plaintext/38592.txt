Ae day twa lads fou eident crackin,
War gaen at pleugh their forenoon yokin:
At length baith tir'd wi' heat o' noon,
Thy loos'd an' on the lee lay down.
Tam, hadnae skill i' beuks nor men;
But just to work an' eat did ken.
Jock had won wi' parson punstock;
An' fer'd three tomans wi' laird Dunstock;
An' pickl'd up some scrapes o' lair,
Frae preachments an' life debonair.
Besides, whane'er he was at leisure,
A beuk to him was rowth o' treasure:
Frae gloamin' he wad read till mornin;
An' aft forgot his beasts their cornin.
He was a cheild at kirk or fair
Was ne'er dung doil'd wi' warls care:
Gif good or ill the warl bodid,
He ne'er took lent, but onward nodded.
A crak an' chapen wi' a neighbour,
Whan gloamin doupit he was eager.
He never mickle spake himsel;
But fidg'd at ilka clever tale.
Some thought him dour, some ca'd him mad,
Some thought him a right sonsie lad.
Some said he kept tryst wi' the witches,
An' raid wi' them owr bogs and ditches:
Because at morn he was sae throwlie,
An' yokit to his darg but dowlie.
He carednae whate'er fock said o' him,
For clish-ma-claver was below him.

"Wow Jock!" quoth Tam, "I'ave aften thaught
What way we are sae dowrly wraught;
Whyle gentry chaps wi' unfylt shoon,
Gang to their bed an' sleep till noon;
Syne rise wi' mony a girnin yawn,
Whyle beengin' servan's roun' them fawn;
An' at a sour leuk, or correction,
Maun nouther frein nor mint objection.
We poor dogs toil 'mang frost an' sna',
An' face the cauldest win's that blaw:
Syne fundit, whan our yokin's dune,
I' a ha'f theekit Spence sit down;
Unto a dinner ha'flins dicht;
An' maun nae grudge but cae it right:
For gif we soud mak ony obstic
Our dames wad clunk us wi' the kail-stick."

"'Tis true," quoth Jock, "We toil fu fair
For scrapes o' meat an' warl's geer.
But gif we're wi' our lot contentit,
An' rise at morn wi' god's bethankit,
We're just as happy as the gentry,
Wha 'joy their weel cram'd kist an' pantry,
Envy nae man his happy life:
Ye dinnae ken his private grief.
There's mony ane thought happy, bein,
Hag-rid wi' conscience, gout, an' spleen.
For guid is roovit to nae state:
It comes to us an' lea'es the great.
An' whyles capricious gangs away
Frae gentle virtue's comelie sway."

"De'il speed ye!  Jock, ye'd ding me donnor"
Quoth Tam, "there is his Lordships honour,
Has nane o' warl's ill to fash him:
But coaches owr the dubs to plash him,
He steghs on fat, synds't down wi' wine,
An' gangs i' claes o' superfine,
He sits on cushions, sleeps on down,
Fares weel i' kintry an' i' town:
An' gif sic are nae pleas'd wi' that,
I kennae what de'il they'd be at."

Quoth Jock, "Did walth true pleasure gie,
Tam, you an' me wad sune agree.
But lad, I can you eithly tell,
How walth to sic's a very h&mdash;ll.
They're a' maist stane-blind wi' delusion,
An' unsain'd 'mid a vast profusion.
Their wit is i' sic whimsies steepit,
Tho' they hae gear they cannae keepit.
Their masks, assemblies, routs, ridottos,
Are 'neath a rati'nal bein's notice:
They gang to thae fu triglie braided,
An' come hame like tir'd ponnies laded.
Grane a' niest day dull, wearie, languid,
Like malefactors 'fore their hanged:
Wreak their spleen on maiks an servan',
An' keep their hames i' constant fermen';
Till pleas'd again wi' drinkin' roarin'
An' then slid to their beds, sick snorin'.
It's an ill win' that blaws nae guid;
It's a weak rain that brings nae fluid;
Sae'ts guid for merchandize an' trade,
That the grit fock are ha'flin's mad.

"I am nae foe to social meetin',
Whare temperance sitteth sweet invitin',
To taste the sweet, avoid the sours;
An' leads fock hame at decent hours.
But they, whenever they begin
The de'il's nae fit to had them in:
They loup owr Heaven's holy laws;
An' mock at Satan's elric paws.
An' a' our christian's tenets guid
They tent nae mare than pagan's creed.
What hae they for them substitutit?
But wred opinions self refutit:
That clash against a' sense an' reason,
An' deem'd by Heaven's laws high treason.
Their mirth degenerates to sadness;
Their sociality turns madness.
Their promises profuse o' kin'ness
O' mornin' mist or reek remin' us.
Their converse vague unmeanin' chat;
Nae frae the heart, but gabb'd by rat.
An' ceremony in their ha'
Stalks like a statue made o' sna'.
The couthie word the frien'lie grip,
Ne'er raise their hands nor move their lip.

"Whan sic as us chance to fa' ut,
At nieves we tak a bangin' bout;
An' a black e'e, or bluidy nose,
Does ay the poor fock's drama close;
Syne 'gree out owr a pint o' yill,
An' min'nae grudge nor farther ill.
But gentry whan they'r once affronted,
Are wild as tigers fiercely hunted:
Their prudence, reason's thrawn aside,
Or knockit down by brutal pride:
Death or d&mdash;mn&mdash;n does nae budge 'em;
Nor Heavens head aboon to judge 'em.
The least untentit, lowse spoke word,
Gars them draw the duellin' sword;
An' syne infuriate murder teems,
As tragic as i' Gothic times.

"Whan that the warl 'gainst us gang,
It gaurs us yoke the wark mair thrang;
To woo the graces o' dame fortune,
Till she comes to our hames gay sportin'.
But whan to them she wrys her face,
It does their hopes o' guid deface:
Syne lea'es the post their God does give them,
'Fore He by Special Writ relieve them;
An' gloomy, glunchin, senseless, sowr,
A dagger or hemp rope's their cure!
Thus down the stream o' dissipation,
They en' their raid i' mirk ruination.

"An for their pastime &mdash; doiled sport!
Either i' kintry, town, or court:
Intriguin' gamin' an' horse racin',
Murd'rin, hares deer, an' dogs chacin',
Owr bogs, killin' hen an' moor cock;
An' frae a share o't barin' poor fock.
For soud we catch a salmon trout,
Or mint on muirs to fell a pout,
Our lot is prosecution, law,
An' plagu'd wi' jails, an' lawwer's jaw.

"But tent them by themsels deluded,
Wi' lack o' wit haf blinkand hooded,
For gif a poor man tell them truth,
They'le swear't a lie straught frae his mouth:
A rich man tells them stupit nonsense,
Yet complimentit for his strong sense.

"That insolence intail'd an rank,
Their gowden dross i' pouch or bank,
A wheen lowse maxims lair'd at college,
An' flung at us for kittle knowledge,
The glare o' dress, the strut of pride,
An' flatterers sappin' their weak side,
Their guilty meal, an' canty ingle,
Sport rousin' wine to smoor a' pingle,
Do hichten them i' poor fock's sense;
An' gie to guilt a consequence.
'Tis only money makes the odds,
An' that to avarice makes them gods."

"Lard, Jock," quoth Tam, whan ye're discrievin'
Ye gang ayont a focks believin'.
I'm sure whan am before his honor
Am just as gif shot stiff wi' thun'ner.
An' gif he was nae something great,
I ne'er was leuk sae unco blate."

"Tam, it's your fear an' want o' sense
That mak to you the difference.
Tho' they may brag o' purer bluid,
True grandeur lies i' bein' guid.
I hald it guid &mdash; the Tattler says
They're dead the maist feck o' their days:
Whene'er they reach the eild o' nine,
Then they their lives do maisly tyne.
There's mony ane throuch a' their life
Lives just by gi'en to ithers grief.
There is Lard Moorfield whan he's flurried
Brags he's sax thousand maukins worried.
Besides three thousand cocks an' hens
He's shot upo' the upland fens.
He only lives upo' the heath:
His only pleasure's gi'en death.
There's Sir John Du'list west the way
Throuch honor's murd'red ten an' mae.
To him's the hicht o' warls joy,
Whan frien'ships ban's he does distroy.
Hear Willy Watwame owr his bowl,
Ca' a' man but himsel a fool;
He had a fortune bein an' braw,
But p&mdash;t it aff anenst a wa'.
Lord Canker five score maids debauch'd;
Wha're now in stews all p&mdash;x't an' wretch'd:
'Twal o' their mithers died fu sad;
Sax fathers to the hills ran mad.
Duke Puerile thinks it nae disgrace,
Far a' his gartens, starns, an' lace;
To rid wi' jockies a horse race.
The only twa things he ca's guid
'S a startin' stupe &mdash; a horse o' bluid.
Lord Griblib is weel kent to ony;
He wastes a poun, an' hains a penny:
Wad fain be thought a witty wicht,
An' does nane guid but throuch some flicht.
Earl Cribbage sin' he was cock able,
Has ay been at the gamin' table,
An' dupit sae by Hoyle's carritch
That he can nae buy sa't for's parritch.
A' ken Laird Tallow's only fame
Is just to stegh his buirdly wame.
Wi' a' kin kind o' stuff, the ca'f,
Has made his maw a' creatures graff.
An' tho' his lungs can scarcely wallop
He chews ay owr the tither collop.
He's sour ay whan he disnae eat;
An' never laughs but owr his meat.
Jock Tulip's ein are fixt on dress,
Starch powther, an' a keikin glass.
An' to this moment, disnae ken
The odds 'twist foppery an' man.
Rob Trifle is on plays sae mad,
Night rambles an' ilk masquerade,
That for thae twenty years an' mair
He's never had a thought sincere.
An' damns an' hisses plays fu' guid,
Whan the rough rabble shakes their head.
His head is a contortit jumble,
Frae whilk crude sentences do rumble.
Dan Daubweel wi' his wry grimaces
Is welcome to an hunder places:
At fleechin' he has sic an art,
That gains a neuk i' ilka heart.
At this art he's sae glibly guid,
He fleecht ane sae she ran red wud.
Yet ony that him kin' caresses,
He cursses 'hind their backs for asses:
Yet mair essential to ilk house,
Than cats to clear't o' rat or mouse:
Tam Pucker's sic anither hynail:
And vends about diurnal scandal.
He helps a Lady to her tea,&mdash;
Bows &mdash; 'Lord guid Madam what think ye
O' poor gallantish Grizzy Mode?
She's pregnant &mdash; true 'as death by G&mdash;!
Whether to cook, or groom, o' chamber,
I really cannae now remember;
'Twas Lady Blastfame tauld it me,
I' secret tither nicht at tea.
Thus Pucker Splirts his woefu venom,
Upo' the fame o' man an' woman:
An' feeds wi' ilka that, an' this,
The spleen o' soe bit playfu' miss.
What is it thus maks brutes o' men?
The smoor their reason wad ye ken:
The peacefu' whisp'rin's o' the soul
They lat fause appetites owr-rule.
An' seenil wrang, or rin agight
But whan they think themsels aricht.
Yet there are some athort the yird,
Wha do a' mankin' circumgird,
Wi' luive, like that, whilk, God to Worth,
Fu' pleas'd bestows, i' hour o' birth.
Yet sic alake!  We seenil see,
But just to tantalize our e'e,
Or vexin' tells sae a' soud be."

The sun now frae the twal hour point,
Had nearly skifftit twa hours yont.
Tam gae a hegh to Jock an' leugh:
Syne baith gat up an' yok'd the pleugh.
