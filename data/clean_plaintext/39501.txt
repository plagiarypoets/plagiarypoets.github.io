My groves and my woodlands are green,
Fair lilies my vallies adorn;
Each rose in her splendour is seen,
Nor wishes th' approach of the morn;
No frosts of the winter are here,
So killing to love and to flow'rs;
The ri'lets their heads they now rear,
And eglantine graces my bow'rs.

My brooks glide with murmur along,
Their streams are transparently clear;
While birds in an elegant song,
With music salute my glad ear;
My trees in their glory are seen,
Where branches the leaves now adorn,
O!  colour a beautiful green;
Yet please not my bosom forlorn.

But ah!  would sweet Phillis come here
And grace with her presence m bow'r;
What joys!  and what transports sincere,
On a bosom so tender she'd pour.
Then Phillis the fairest of fair,
No longer fly from the fond swain,
Whose doom, if not lov'd, is despair;
For nought can alleviate his pain.
