Pure as the snowy bosom of the morn,
Now may Urania all her graces bend;
First, let Benevolence the hours adorn,
And Charity o'er all her mantle wend,
Ah!  let not aught refrain the fost'ring friend!
Ill would it suit when Riot roams around,
O'erpaid with blessing on this festive day,
That e'en Misfortune cheerless should be found,
Or Worth excluded from the glad scenes stray,
Where Heav'n has smil'd on man with warm benignant ray.

And come, Philanthropy!  devoid of gall,
Who like the sun a constant smile supplies;
Now may Contraction shrink from off the ball,
Smit with the milder radiance of thine eyes,
Maugre the groveling Bigot's bursting sighs:
Nor let th' unthinking mock thy god-like power,
Who never knew the thrilling joy to bless;
Who never check'd the swoln eye-burning show'r,
Nor hush'd the wild waves of acute distress;
Nor gave a tongue to Heav'n its grateful aid to bless.

The, tho' the wintry waste should heap around,
And Nature's gay variety destroy,
Each cheerful trace in icy sheen confound,
The mind's bright orb shall know no damp alloy;
Nor time nor age exhaust the source of joy!
But like th' Equatorial clime shall bring
Perennial blossoms to adorn the year;
And oft to Happiness renew the spring,
More richly redolent, serenely clear,
To fame-recording song and every virtue dear.
