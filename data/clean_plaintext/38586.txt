The shrill trompettes sounde th' allaram loude;
The gallant Knightys in armour rich bedighte
Enter the lystes, ymounted high on horses proude,
Prank'd in boss'd harnyss, neighying for the fyght.

The heraulds tall, in purfled mantyls cladde,
In quanynte devyces wroughte (by connynge honde)
Of knyghtlie chevisaunces long since hadde,
With caytive paynim in the haly londe,

Proclayme with loude voyce the courteous fyghte;
Whyle evir and anon the cornets sounde,
And pleasaunt layes pronounced by ladyes bryghte,
And cheerynge mynshelsie are hearde arounde.

High seats, and gaye pavyllions cirque the place,
Where royal dames and damosels faire are seen,
With princelie lordes, of highe descent and grace,
And courtlie youth, and hoarie eld, I weene.

Alofte in ayre, the silken banners fly;
The postes with scutcheons of pretence are hong;
The streamers in the buxome welkin playe,
And lyttle banderoles here and theare are flong.

Hearke!  hearke!  a hondredde brazen trompettes braye!
The charge!  the charge!  a thousande voyces crye;
The fomynge steedes rush forwarde to the fraye;&mdash;
The clutterynge armoure ryngs &mdash; the broken launces flye.

But who ys he, ycased in hauberque bryghte?
Hys scalie greaves with golden owches boss'd&mdash;
Hys polished marion dazzles humaine syghte&mdash;
Hys loftie plumasse by the wynde is toss'd?

Hys milk whyte horse, yprauncing tears the grownde,
And champes the bytte, and shakes hys flowynge mayne;
He snorts, and flyngs hys foame arownde,
Throwes hyghe his hedde, and scorns the curbed rayne!
