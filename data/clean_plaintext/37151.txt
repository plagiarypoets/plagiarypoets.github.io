On that sad day, when from his Maker's woes,
The sun his horror-darken'd rays withdrew,
My heart, by sadness hush'd into repose,
Thoughtless of danger was ensnar'd by you;
No time it seem'd defences to renew
'Gainst mighty love, I dreaded not his art,
And as the gen'ral grief around me grew
My rising sorrows claim'd their fatal part.
Love found me quite unarm'd, and to my heart
An open passage thro' my tear-spent eyes.
Inglorious he, to speed his sharpest dart
At me, and win so poor, so mean a prize!
And not for you, my fair, his terrors show,
Nor bend at your defended breast his bow!
