Another sweetly palid maid was there;
Of downcast, melting eye;
Her head alternate o'er each shoulder laid,
Her bosom orb'd by many a deep-drawn sigh;
Love was her name.
She touch'd the strings,
But thought the while on other things;
And, desultory as she play'd,
"Dear sweetest swain!" full oft she said,
"Dear sweetest swain for whom I pine,
Would mine thou wert, and I were thine!"
She started, sigh'd, and talk'd alone;
And ever as she said
"Dear sweetest swain!"
Her looks were motionless as stone.
