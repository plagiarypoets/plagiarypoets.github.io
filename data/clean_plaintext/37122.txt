"How slow we drive &mdash;  but yet the hour will come
When friends shall greet me with affection's kiss&mdash;
When seated at my boyhood's happy home,
I shall enjoy that mild contented bliss,
Not often met with in a world like this;
Then I shall see that brother &mdash; youngest born,
I used to play with in my sportiveness,
And from a mother's silence I shall learn
A parent's thanks to God &mdash; for a lov'd son's return.

"And there is one, who, with a down-cast eye,
Will be the last to welcome me &mdash; but yet
My memory tells me of a parting sigh,
And of a cheek with tears of sorrow wet,
And how she bade me never to forget
A friend &mdash; and blush'd. &mdash; And I shall see again
The look of kindness, as when last we met
And parted? &mdash; Tell me then that life is vain:
That joy, if met with once, is seldom met again."

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

&mdash;see ye not the falling, fallen mass!
Hark!  hear ye not the drowning swimmer's cry?
Look on the ruins of the desperate pass;
Gaze at the hurried ice that rushes by,
Bearing a freight of wo and agony
To that last harour, where we all must go.
Resistless as the stormy clouds that fly
Above our reach, is that dark stream below&mdash;
Like time, it knows no ebb, till it has ceas'd to flow.
