Hail, C**, hail!  nor may the mournful voice
Of unknown song displease thee:  rather lend
To poor LORENZO'S strains
A willing, listening ear;
Yes, sober matron!  fain would he recount
In part the comforts which thy town affords;
And to thy daughters fair
Address the grateful lay;
For fair thy daughters are, and kind as fair,
And wise as kind, and generous as wise,
And sweet as generous, and good
And innocent as sweet.
Oft have they wing'd with bliss LORENZO'S hours,
When sad reflection else had whelm'd his thoughts,
And sorrow's sharpest fangs
Were fastening on his soul!
Yet, though the gentle converse of the fair
Prov'd thus consolatory, wanton fires
Ne'er flutter'd in his breast
But friendship's hallow'd warmth
Matur'd to chastest love inspir'd each thought.
When he was wont to muse upon his fate
He sigh'd; &mdash; to find that hope
Held forth no cheering ray
By which he might ascend to HYMEN'S fane;
Unless, in human thought!  his recreant mind
Consented to involve
A partner in his woes!
