Daughter of dulness!  canting dame!
Thou night-mare on the breast of joy,
Whose drowsy morals, still the same,
The stupid sooth, the gay annoy;
Soft cradled in thy sluggish arms,
E'en footpads prate of guilt's alarms,
And pig-tail'd sailor's sadly queer,
Affect the melting mood, and drop the pitying tear.

When first, to tickle Britain's nose,
HUGH KELLY rais'd his leaden quill,
Thy poppies lent the wish'd repose,
And bade the gaping town be still.
Poor COMEDY!  thine opiate lore
With patience many a day she bore,
Till GOLDSMITH all thy hopes dismay'd,
And drove thee from the stage by Tony Lumpkin's aid.

Scar'd by the lanthorn visage, flee
Thalia's offspring light and merry,
Loud laughter, wit, and repartee,
And leave us moralizing CHERRY.
They fly, and carry in their line,
GRIMALDI, Goose, and Columbine,
To Sadler's Wells, by DIBDIN taken,
With him they vow to dwell, nor find themselves forsaken.

Soliloquy, with clamorous tongue,
That brings the lord knows what to view,
And Affectation pert and young,
Swearing to love &mdash; the lord knows who,
Still round the midnight cauldron caper:
Warm Charity, with Newland's paper,
And baby Bounty not unwilling
To give to mother dear, her new King George's shilling.

Oh gently o'er the modern stage,
Fair preacher, raise thy deaf'ning din!
Not with the metaphoric rage,
That guides the sword of Harlequin:
(As erst thou did'st the town amuse)
With tender bailiffs, generous Jews,
Socratic hosiers, praying sailors,
Chaste harlots, letter'd clowns, and duel-fighting tailors.

Forbear thy handkerchief of brine,
Some gleams of merriment admit;
Be tears in moderation thine,
To water, not to drown the pit.
But if with streaming eyes askew,
Thou still wilt blubber five acts through,
Have pity on a son of rhyme,
Usurp the play &mdash; 'tis yours &mdash; but spare the pantomime.
