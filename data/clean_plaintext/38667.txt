Hye thee hence, thou Spectre rude,
Nor on MISERY'S steps intrude!
No more delight aroud his head
Thy purple sanguine robe to spread,
Stain'd with which all comfort flies,
And to the Wretch's haggard eyes
No object threatens but DESPAIR,
With all her visions bleak and bare!
Fly hence, nor thus possess him whole;
But spare the frenzied SUFFERER'S Soul!

Alas, the glorious beams of DAY
To him no beauties e'er display,
And lonely NIGHT'S all covering gloom
But points at hand the shrouding Tomb;
He throws him on the crumbling stone,
And lowly heaves the sullen groan&mdash;
He starts, for on his trembling ear
Strike the dull sounds of Demons near,
That bid him "Misery's power defy,
Rush from her clasp &mdash; and boldly DIE."

"Think, Wretch," the voice proceeds to say,
"Of all thy Comforts flown away&mdash;
Of even hourly proof that FRIENDS
Surround you but for selfish ends,
Like insects in the NOON of day,
But at your SETTING haste away&mdash;
Think on &mdash; Of service unrepaid,
By Power neglected, scorn'd, betray'd,
When PENURY'S rent robes enfold
Thy limbs &mdash; and now those limbs grow old.

"Of Splendour thou canst never know,
Of all a hopeless FUTURE'S woe,
Thy Children's agonizing pain,
Looking for help &mdash; to look in vain."
He yields &mdash; The tempting fiend has found
The galling grief &mdash; the mortal wound.
Resolv'd his eager footsteps bend
Towards their miserable end&mdash;
But bear his sorrows into sight,
And plunge him in perpetual night.
