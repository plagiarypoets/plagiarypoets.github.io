More glorious than the immortal hierarchy!
Minist'ring spirits they &mdash; Almighty thou!
In name diverse &mdash; ever the one Most High;
Creation's Lord, all hail! &mdash; for thou wilt bow
A father's ear:  our lips' faint echoes die;
Yet breath from thee to thee ascendeth now,
O God! &mdash; and since all breathing things may bring
The offering of their praise, I too thy praise will sing.

Thou, of this wheeling universe the stay!
Thine hand moves all, above, beneath, around;
Pointing the winged lightning on its way,
When nature starts, then trembles at the sound.
Thy flaming bolts how terrible! &mdash; yet they,
Thine errand done, depart, and are not found:
Or found but in thy kindly fires, that flow
Throughout this mighty frame, where life and beauty glow.

All by thy word is done, through land, or sea,
Or where yon fields of light ethereal beam:
Save that, by minds mysteriously left free,
Perversely wrought. &mdash; Things all uncouth that seem
Are fair in that fair order framed by thee;
And things unlovely share thy love supreme.
O wond'rous harmony!  O mystic band,
That binds both good and ill in thine unerring hand!

Yet man that holy guiding bond would fly;
Though panting still for good &mdash; for bliss, unfound,
Save in the law of love that rules the sky.
O madness! &mdash; but he makes, at every bound,
A wounding fetter of that silken tie.
Eager he grasps at glory's empty sound;
At treasures of the mart, or of the mine;
At joys of grosser sense, &mdash; at every joy, but thine.

O ruler of the thunder, and the cloud!
Thou giver of all good! &mdash; The heart beguiled
Illume, O God! &mdash; bend thou the will unbowed;
And look with pity on thine erring child.
Shed there thy harmonies; and clear and loud,
Notes, like unwonted music from the wild,
Shall answer thee, and thy last give desire&mdash;
A heart full tuned to swell the UNIVERSAL CHOIR.
