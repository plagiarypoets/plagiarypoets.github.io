Delicious as the mingling songs of spring,
As lark's loud hyming to the dewy hours,
Or earliest opening of sweet-lipped flowers,
Which we have watched from their first blooming;
Wild as the notes which some white hand will fling
From new-strung harp, unweeting of its powers;
Glad as that happy song the bee doth sing
When he sees summer decking out her bowers;
Sweet as the voice of a blythe-hearted maid
When she is blythest, or the seldom heard
Impassionate lay that love doth serenade
A mistress with, taking her like a bird,&mdash;
Are these first voicings of thy early lyre,
Which Spenser pleased might hear, who was thy genius' sire.
