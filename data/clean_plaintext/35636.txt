Could wishes health, that heavenly boon, command&mdash;
Through lengthen'd years its blessing still extend,
How would the Poet's heart with joy expand
To see it crown his venerable Friend!
Then, as old seasons circled to their end,
And rolling Time brought round again the new,
PERCY!  for thee our prayers should still ascend,
And many a happy year yet meet thy view:
For ah!  thy virtues are possess'd by few&mdash;
Few exercise benevolence like thine&mdash;
No flattery this, but sterling Merit's due,
A tribute wafted from Truth's hallowed shrine.
May the return of this auspicious day
Augment thy comforts, and thy cares allay!
