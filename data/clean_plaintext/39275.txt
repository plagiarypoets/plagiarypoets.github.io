Reclining sad beneath an aged Yew,
The sea, and many royal ships in view!
O'erwhelm'd with amorous woe, a pining swain
In moving accents thus bespoke his pain.

"Time was &mdash; and is it fled, ye pow'rs divine?
When bless'd I thought sweet Rosalinda mine.
How happy in these shades, and rural bow'rs,
Last summer did we pass our golden hours!
But now I feel the alter'd nymph's disdain,
She slights my love, and disregards my pain:
In gay delight the courtly dance she leads,
Herself the fairest of our faithless maids!
Who all, like her, their constant shepherds shun,
As if they took a pride to be undone!
These sons of Neptune, with their wanton arts,
Have quite debauch'd our modest virgins hearts.

"What tho' the Gallic fleets insult our coast,
And France and Spain of our inaction boast?
Our land and naval heroes, dress'd for show,
Regard no weapons now, but Cupid's bow;
At balls they shine, and curl their powder'd hair,
Bedaub'd with lace to captivate the fair:
Too weak their souls to feel the warriour's fire,
These are the mighty conquests they desire.
And yet with these, tho' ignominious arts,
Have they ensnar'd our tender virgins hearts.

"And shall such rivals, only, skill'd to dance,
The scorn of Britons, while the apes of France;
Shall they &mdash; who dread the daring foe to face,
Find in our bright assemblies any grace?
No, British fair! &mdash; assert your antient fame,
Let the brave only your protection claim;
Be he alone, who fights his country's cause,
Bless'd in your smiles, and crown'd in your applause.
So shall these triflers mourn their baffled arts,
Nor, shameful thus, delude your virgin hearts!"

More he had spoke &mdash; but night her mantle spread
And the swain rose &mdash; to seek his lonely bed.
