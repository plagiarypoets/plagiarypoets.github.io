The sweetest swain young Damon was,
The pride of all his kin;
None blither e'er a whistle tun'd,
Or so the heart could win.

Near by the banks of rural Dee
The gentle youth was born;
And twenty opening Springs had seen
The youth those banks adorn.

The rising hope the shepherds all
With benisons pursued;
For never was a kinder soul,
Or with more worth endowed.

And well their benisons might they
Give him where'er he went;
For many a cordial lift, I ween,
To them had Damon lent.

For, yet tho' green and few his years,
In wisdom he was old;
And many an hoary-headed swain
Admir'd the tales he told.

In precepts too of letter'd lore
So well his youth was train'd,
The deepest clerk in all the land
Would scarce with him contend.

And softly on his oaten pipe
He play'd so sweet and shrill,
Scarce Edwin on the banks of Dee
Could boast an higher skill.

Nor was an herb, or eke a flower,
In garden, hill, or dale,
But he with nicest art could cull,
And all their virtues tell.

Full many a cheek has Damon dried,
And gladden'd many an heart,
And many a blessing on his name
Approves his healing art:

For doubly still he with success
In all he did was crown'd;
His kind condolence sooth'd the soul,
His med'cine cur'd the wound.

For never heart in others' grief
A truer part could bear;
And want, where wealth could not bestow,
Still had from him a tear.

Yet much his pity wish'd to give,
Tho' scanty was his store;&mdash;
Alas!  where Nature gave the heart,
That Fate should give no more!

Riches to suit his generous wish
He left the vale to gain;
Eager the blessing to diffuse
O'er all his native plain.

Swift sail'd the bark, and far away
The young adventurer bare,
From the flowery banks of Dee,
And many weeping there.

And from Domingo's port he gain'd;&mdash;
Alas!  unkindly shore!
Woe's me!  the bonny Hill of Fair
Shall hear his pipe no more!

Oh!  where were then the cooling gales
That blow on Scotia's hills?
Where ever healing herb and flower
That grow beside her rills?

Oh!  where was ever pious prayer
That sped him on his way;
How, Virtue's guardian Angel's!  thus
Could ye your trust betray?

Could nought so good a father's wish,
A mother's tears prevent;
Nor all the ardent vows to Heav'n
By Love and Friendship sent?

Cold in a foreign grave, alas!
The lovely youth is laid!
Peaceful beneath the grassy turf
He rests his lowly head!

Yet, tho' affection drop a tear&mdash;
For what can Nature less?&mdash;
"Let resignation every vain
Rebellious sigh repress."

Then cease, ye parents, cease to mourn;
Why, ye sad sisters!  weep?
He is not dead; &mdash; he only lays
Him down awhile to sleep.

Ye simple shepherds, sigh no more;
Your kindest, blithest swain,
Tho' he'll to you no more return,
To cheer the 'custom'd plain;

Oh well is he!  Rejoice and sing,
And bless the hour has given
So gentle and so bright a new
Inhabitant to Heaven.

If love of him you wish to shew,
Like him aspire to be;
So in some happier land at last
Your friend ye yet may see.

When the Great Shepherd sounds his call,
And all the dead arise,
Then, crown'd with glory, ye shall hail
Your Damon in the skies.
