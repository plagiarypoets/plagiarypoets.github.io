Ye breezes mild and gentle gales,
Whose breath proptitious fills the swelling sails,
And bids the vessel swiftly glide
Thro' angry seas, and stem the stubborn tide,
O whither, whither will ye bear me hence
To haughty pow'r a slave and lawless insolence?

Will ye alas!  in Doric lands
Subject me to some proud Greek's stern commands?
Or waft me to the fertile coast
Of Pthia, where in wand'ring mazes lost
The fam'd Apidanus rolls his silver floods
Thro' meads of verdant hue, and shadowy darkling woods?

Or must I to the isle repair
Select and sacred to LATONA fair,
Where verdant laurels never sear
And lofty pines their blooming branches rear;
To join the youthful choir's united voice,
And sing of DIAN chaste, whose care the bow employs.

For lofty Athens must I part,
To shade the curious vest with nicest art,
To paint MINERVA'S glorious car,
Adorn the tapestry with scenes of war,
Or point the forked bolt with flaming rage,
On Titans hurl'd, that durst heav'n's awful king engage?

See, blazing fires from hapless Ilion rise,
While clouds of circling smoke obscure the skies,
O dire distress!  why only am I left,
Of children, parents, brethren, all bereft?
Why thus reserv'd a prey to proud domain,
Far hence in foreign lands to drag the galling chain?
