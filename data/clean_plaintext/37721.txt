I had a dream! &mdash; my spirit was unbound
From the dark iron of its dungeon, clay,
And rode the steeds of Time; &mdash; my thoughts had sound,
And spoke without a word, &mdash; I went away
Among the buried ages, and did lay
The pulses of my heart beneath the touch
Of the rude minstrel Time, that he should play
Thereon, a melody which might seem such
As musing spirits love &mdash; mournful, but not too much!

I had a dream &mdash; and there mine eyes did see
The shadows of past deeds like present things&mdash;
The sepulchres of Greece and Hespery,
Aegyptus, and old landes, gave up their kings,
Their prophets, saints, and minstrels, whose lute-strings
Keep a long echo &mdash; yea, the dead, white bones,
Did stand up by the house whereto Death clings,
And dressed themselves in life, speaking of thrones,
And fame, and power, and beauty, in familiar tones!

I went back further still, for I beheld
What time the earth was one fair Paradise&mdash;
And over such bright meads the waters welled,
I wot the rainbow was content to rise
Upon the earth, when absent from the skies!
And there were tall trees that I never knew,
Whereon sate nameless birds in merry guise,
Folding their radiant wings, as the flowers do,
When summer nights send sleep down with the dew.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Anon there came a change &mdash; a terrible motion,
That made all living things grow pale and shake!
The dark Heavens bowed themselves unto the ocean,
Like a strong man in strife &mdash; Ocean did take
His flight across the mountains; and the lake
Was lashed into a sea where the winds ride&mdash;
Earth was no more, for in her merrymake
She had forgot her God &mdash; Sin claimed his bride,
And with his vampire breath sucked out her life's fair tide!

Life went back to her nostrils, and she raised
Her spirit from the waters once again&mdash;
The lovely sights, on which I erst had gazed,
Were not &mdash; though she was beautiful as when
The Grecian called her "Beauty" &mdash; sinful men
Walked i' the track of the waters, and felt bold&mdash;
Yea, they looked up to Heaven in calm disdain,
As if no eye had seen its vault unfold
Darkness, and fear, and death! &mdash; as if a tale were told!

And ages fled away within my dream;
And still Sin made the heart his dwelling-place,
Eclipsing Heaven from men; but it would seem
That two or three dared commune face to face,
And speak of the soul's life, of hope, and grace&mdash;
Anon there rose such sounds as angels breath&mdash;
For a God came to die, bringing down peace&mdash;
"Pan was not;" and the darkness that did wreathe
The earth, past from the soul &mdash; Life came by death!
