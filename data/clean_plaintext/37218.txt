Why from the Throne where BEAUTY sits SUPREME,
And countless Emanations deals below,
Infus'd and fixt in Woman's shining frame
Doth so large portion of his Wonder flow?
Why, but to rule the tread of human Woe,
And point our erring feet where Joys abide?
But, ah the pity, to a traitor-flame
Weak, wavering, wild, the heaven-born ray is ty'd,
And Man, confiding Man, from bliss estranged wide.

Daughters of Britain, scorn the garish fire;
Exile the meteor to it's Pharian Grave:
Sincerer Flames from Virtue's heights aspire,
That brighten Beauty, and from Sorrow save:
High o'er the rest see what fair hand doth wave
A deathless Torch; and calls you to the Shrine
Where only Beauty, only Bliss entire!
Follow the branch of much lov'd **'s line;
And from those Altars mend, with her, the ray divine.
