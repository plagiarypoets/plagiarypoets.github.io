How sink the brave, who in the blaze expire,
Where tyrants kindled freedom's funeral pyre;
Who in her dear defence their falchions bore,
And sought to conquer, fell to bleed no more.

Oft memory lingers near, their turf to bless,
And scatter o'er it nature's brightest dress;
Oft valor pauses, as he passes by,
And many a tribute sparkles in his eye.

Oft freedom leaves her wildly blooming cell,
And haunts the turf, where crumbling heroes dwell,
Bends o'er the sainted earth, and bathes the sod,
Of those, who rose from battle to their God.
