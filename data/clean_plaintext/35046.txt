It was the month in which the righteous Maid,
That for disdain of sinful worlds upbraid,
Fled back to Heaven, whence she was first conceived,
Into her silver bower, the sun received;
And the hot Syrian dog on him awaiting,
After the chased lion's cruel baiting,
Corrupted had th' air with his northern breath,
And pour'd on th' earth plague, pestilence, and death.
Emongst the rest, a wicked malady
Reign'd emongst men, the many did to die,
Depriv'd of sense and ordinary reason;
That it to leeches seemed strange and geason. . . .
