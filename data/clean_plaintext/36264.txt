O there are thoughts that sweep along the mind
Like shadows flying o'er a field of corn,
Like lights and shades before the driving wind
O'er the broad bosom of the Ochills born:
These are the robes Poetic souls have worn,
Shifting their drapery, ever wild and new&mdash;
Nor reck they how the world may hold in scorn
Those fantasies of every form and hue
With which they garlands weave, far from the vulgar crew.

These be it mine to follow &mdash; like the bee
Sipping from every bud and mountain flower&mdash;
Where'er the wings of love do carry me,
O'er hill, o'er dale, through sunshine, and through shower&mdash;
Where rolls the ocean, where the storm-beat tower
Frowns on the cliff, or where the rivulet's maze
Melodiously encircles grove and bower;
No matter where my roving spirit strays,
If Nature still be there, and Fancy's living rays.

No theme proposed or thought of, on my flight
Abroad I launch into the boundless air,
I feel my pinions shivering with delight,
Moved by the Zephyrs bland that winnow there&mdash;
Heaven all serene above, Earth bright and fair
Below; under mine eye a dazzling stream
Ripples around its dry white stones, to where
A wood enfolds it from the noon-day beam&mdash;
I follow its sunk course, and lay me down and dream.

Green is the fairy turf on which I rest,
And oak trees wave their chequering light around&mdash;
Forth from the depth of shades, a maiden drest
In huntress guise, steps out, with buskins bound,
Her laughing face somewhat with toil embrown'd&mdash;
Say, have you seen (quoth she) the deer I chased,
For this way fled he from my questing hound?&mdash;
Scarce waiting my reply, she onward paced,
And darker gloomed the wood which late her path had graced.

With that from every bough there trilled the voice
Of birds innumerous, varying their quick notes,
And sunbeams bursting in awoke their joys,
That one wide melody around me floats,
The mingled concord of a thousand throats:
I closed mine eyes in ecstasy, but ceased
Th' aerial minstrelsy at once, when goats
Browzing appeared before me on the breast
Of precipice that o'er that forest reared its crest.

A cave in that rock opened, with a stone
Smooth worn beside it, as an ancient seat,
On which, beneath the wild ash waving lone
Above, whoso sought shelter from the heat
Might there find solace and a calm retreat&mdash;
From the cave's mouth an old man issued slow,
And sate him down, and of the herbs did eat,
Which from his stores he brought, nor needed go
For drink, for at his feet the stream did freshly flow.

Vanish at one quick twinkling, wood and stream,
For that old man has waved his magic wand,
(His white beard shines and passes in the gleam:)
Now, on an open plain I seem to stand,
Where a fair castle rules the subject land
Built on the height &mdash; down falls its passage bridge&mdash;
For sounds a horn, and lo!  its gates expand&mdash;
Ladies and knights wind down the mountain ridge,
And champions pricking forth with knightly privilege,

Meet on the field of arms &mdash; the shivered spears
Clashing against the shields &mdash; the men unhorsed,
The horses running wild &mdash; a thousand fears
In tender bosoms beating &mdash; thus they coursed
And tourneyed, till who plainly had the worst
Are borne array unhonoured, and one youth,
The chosen champion, who the rest has forced
To yield the palm of beauty and of truth
To his bright maid, kneels down, and dear her smile, in sooth.

O poets old forgive, if from your lays
These scattered snatches my preluding strain
Have formed, how weak and barren of all praise,
Compared with your immortal things, which vain
I strive to imitate &mdash; and so profane
The glories of your verse, with creeping style
That feebly labours your height to attain,&mdash;
Upon that summit bright ye sit, and smile
At my poor tottering pace, so lame, and low, and vile!

Yet often on my soul, in life's long day,
Have flashed the glorious gleams of poesy,
Tho' clouds have intercepted quick their ray.
And wrapt me in thick gloom, from which to flee,
My spirit scarce availed me.  Could I see
That light for ever, it would guide me on
Through this vain mask of life, where scarce for me
Is left a part to act, till all is gone
For ever from my eyes, and action there is none.

This world how full of beauty, where the heart
May find a resting place, and it may rest
Without a pang or care, like bird whose art
Has, amid leaves sweet gleaming, form'd a nest!
O could my spirit, ever on the breast
Of Nature, fix its dwelling, as a child
Clings to its mother's bosom, all that's best
On earth were then my portion, and exiled
For ever from my soul, whatever has defiled!

Innocence, Nature, Poesy &mdash; ye are
The graces of man's spirit, led by you
It rises above every inward jar,
And prunes its wings delighted, by the dew
Of love refreshed, which doth its thoughts imbue&mdash;
What is this world of toil, through which we drive,
Imperious passions, fantasies untrue?
Could we possess our souls, how much alive
Were then our better life, how little should we strive!

O what minds have appeared passed along
This theatre of earth &mdash; what thoughts divine
It has awakened &mdash; thoughts that glow in song,
Or haply that could never cross the line
Of the pure soul that formed them &mdash; its confine
Girding them in, as all unfit to meet
The ruffian air, or in the glare to shine
Of wit or verse, however smooth and sweet&mdash;
The secret things of heaven have in the heart their seat!

Were the true revelation made of all
That men have thought since they have skimmed the ground,
As on one greater day will yet befal,
When all that ever breathed shall, at the sound
Of trumpet, gather the high seat around,
Where judgment will be given; O not alone
Would evil from its folds and hidden bound
Break forth, but things more glorious than have known
The light of day, or in the world's proud front have shone:

Dreams of poetic skyey grain, which words
Could ne'er embody &mdash; thoughts of moral good,
Of holiness, to which no form affords
Expression &mdash; (howe'er loftily endued
By school or church with title, oftener feud
Than faith administering) &mdash; love, and peace,
And joy, tricked out in gracious beams, bedewed
With all the beauty which doth never cease
To rise from earth to heaven, like steaming sacrifice.
