They came with would-be gravity &mdash; and led
A helpless being guarded all around;
And then they bar'd unto the sun, his head,
And bound him fierce and tightly to the ground&mdash;
No groan escap'd him &mdash; not a word or sound,
Save a soft sigh his heaving breast upsent;
He was all calmness &mdash; and tho' tightly bound,
His hands he wrung not, nor his grey hairs rent,
But with devoted look, to Heaven a pray'r he sent.

High was the pile around him &mdash; still he sate
Serene and grave &mdash; no angry glance gave he&mdash;
Fierce gaz'd the monks &mdash; yet he, sublimely great.
Look'd to the moment when he should be free
From earthly toils, and earthly vanity,
Without a sigh &mdash; he pitied those who burn'd
With inward rage; and his sincerity
With hatred direful, inhuman spurn'd,
And now their vengeful eyes, in menace to him turn'd.

"Wilt thou recant?" cried one with eye of fire,
"Wilt thou throw off thy vile religion &mdash; seek
From the blest virgin a more pure attire
Than thine own curs'd habiliments?" his cheek
Nor blanch'd, nor flush'd &mdash; nor essay'd he to speak
But his wan eye was lighted with a lay
Divinely given; yet 'twas humble &mdash; meek&mdash;
Now it was upward turn'd, as if to say
This is on earth my last, but yet most glorious day!

They look'd with wonder! &mdash; but a moment gaz'd&mdash;
For now the torch was lighted, and the pile
By the breeze puffed, up toward Heaven blaz'd,
Yet he, the suff'rer, calmly sat the while,
And o'er his face there beam'd a blissful smile.
Now stretching forth his arms, he ardent cried,
"Forgive them, Father; let them not revile
Thy name again; but ope conviction's tide"&mdash;
Then with a deep drawn sigh, the humble Martyr died.
