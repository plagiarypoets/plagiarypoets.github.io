TO THE POLE STAR.
Chief amidst northern orbs!  that dost remain
Steadfast, like Him who hung thy lamp on high,
To guide benighted barks o'er ocean's plain,
And point to Constancy the lover's eye.
Let Friendship mark thy shrine in yonder sky,
And shrink from breach of faith, &mdash; the fickle wind
Of summer promises, which wreck the mind,
When wintry storms of penury howl by.
Oh, as thy moveless ray surveys mankind,
Thou haply dost behold a constant few,
But, ah!  the rest are faithless and unkind,
A prowling, selfish, and misleading crew;
In heaven's wide field thou hast not one compeer,
And worth like thine is solitary here.

Spring, just as now, had strewn yon bank with flowers,
And the glad lark was caroling on high,
When, in this solitude of thickening bowers,
I last beheld the magic of her eye.
The whitethroat poured his ditty to the sky,
As if in prelude to a world of love;
The gale with cowslip-perfumes past us by,
And seemed to whisper transports from above;
The azure hyacinth, beneath the grove,
O'erhung the primrose in its covert green,
And nature her transcendent carpet wove,
And decked in wanto playfulness the scene;
With these her cheek the blush of health resigned,&mdash;
Her funeral dirge was autumn's mournful wind.
