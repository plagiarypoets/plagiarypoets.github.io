Now day conceals her face, and darkness fills
The field, the forest, with the shades of night;
The gloomy clouds are gathering round the hills,
Veiling the last ray of the lingering light.
The abyss of heaven appears &mdash; the stars are kindling round;
Who, who can count those stars, who that abyss can sound?

Where are thy secret laws, O Nature, where?
Thy north-lights dazzle in the wintry zone;
How dost thou light from ice thy torches there?
There has thy sun some sacred, secret throne?
See in yon frozen seas what glories have their birth;
Thence night leads forth the day to illuminate the earth.

Is there some vast, some hidden magazine,
Where the gross darkness flames of fire supplies?
Some phosphorous fabric, which the mountains screen?
Whose clouds of light above those mountains rise?
Where the winds rattle loud the foaming sea,
And lift the waves to heaven in thundering revelry?

Thou knowest not!  'tis doubt, 'tis darkness all!
Even here on earth our thoughts benighted stray,
And all is mystery through this worldly ball&mdash;
Who then can reach or read yon milky way?
Creation's heights and depths are all unknown &mdash; untrod&mdash;
Who then shall say how vast, how great creation's God!
