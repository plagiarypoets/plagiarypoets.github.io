O Poverty, tho' from thy haggard eye,
Thy chearless mein, of every charm bereft,
Thy brow, that Hope's last traces long have left,
Vain Fortune's feeble sons with terror fly;
Thy rugged paths with pleasure I attend;
For Fancy, that with many a dream can bless,
And Patience, in the pall of wretchedness,
Sad-smiling as the ruthless storms descend;
And Piety, forgetful of each wrong,
And meek Content, whose griefs no more rebel;
And Genius, warbling sweet her saddest song,
And Pity, list'ning to Misfortune's knell,
Long banish'd from the world's insulting throng,
With thee, and loveliest Melancholy dwell.
