Lost in some sweet abstraction of his muse,
The youthful poet wanders on his way;
Fancy, in bright diversity of hues,
Rich as young Flora's coronet in May,
Or as the rainbow, glittering through the ray,
Which the sun prints on April's watery face,
Lures him a votary to her sentient sway,
With fine-hued forms of ornament and grace.
Ah, poverty!  in vain would'st thou efface
His generous glowings &mdash; high-rais'd hopes divine;
In vain would traffic's hireling sons debase
Those glorious lights that from heaven's radiance shine;
From wrapt Imagination's proudest sphere,
The poet shines a central planet here.
