One fayre Par-royall hath our Iland bred
Whereof one is a live and two are dead
Sidney the Prince of prose and sweet conceit
Spenser of numbers and Heroick Ryme
Injurious Fate did both their lives defeate
For war and want slew both before their time
Now tho they dead lodge in a princely roome
One wants a verse, the other wants a toome.

Camden thou livest alone of all the three
For Roman stile and Englishe historye
Englande made them thou makest Englande knowen
So well art thou the prince of all the payre
Sithence thou hast an Englande of thine owne
Lesse welthy, but as fruitfull and more fayre
Nor is thine Englande moated with the maine
But doth our seas, and firmed lands contain

And scornes the waves wherwith our Ile is pent
Spreadinge it self through the wilde worldes extent.
Lesse needs it feare the swellinge of a brooke
Whose lowly chanell feeds on privat lake
That can the prowder ocean over looke
And all the streames that thence their courses take.
Long may both Englands live and livinge raigne
In spightt of Envy thine and ours of Spaine.

While in ours in thine may thou in ours abide
Thine ages honour and thy cuntries pride
And if perchance th' ingratefull age denies
To grace thy death with toombe and scrolled verse
Each village, church and house their want supplies
Each stone thy grave, each letter is thy verse
And if all those should be with thine outwore
Each streame should grave thy name uppon his shore.
