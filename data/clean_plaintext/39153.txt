From trivial song and lighter lays depart,
Be deaf to Folly if she should insist;
And, O my Muse!  be now thy sober part,
To Contemplation's soothing voice to list.

Hither in pensive mood retir'd, thy bard
Reflection's force with willing mind attends;
Does from his breast each grovelling thought discard,
And to the shrine of Desolation bends.

Enthron'd by Time's capricious hand, around
(Once sat Religion on these nodding piles),
Now tott'ring fragments, with Oblivion crown'd,
And scoffing human nature with his smiles.

Antique Magnificence! &mdash; what wasting cares,
Thy seats, the seats of splendor once, invade!
Methinks thy guardian genius now declares,
Life's but a farce, and time a masquerade!

Your slaves of fortune, Vanity, convene,
On Pride's gilt wing no longer let them tow'r,
But stoop to view this desolated scene,
The splendid shrine of some more happy hour.

Be this their mirror, &mdash; and from hence they'll know,
Fortune's inconstant, and more light than air;
To-day, perhaps, her kindest favours flow,
To-morrow she involves us in despair.

Oh!  what ideas now the Muse might trace;
Retirement's hour to Wisdom lends its aid,
And gives the philosophic mind that grace
Which Reason succours when by Truth array'd.

Imagination catches this repose,
And paints to view, thro' Retrospection's eye,
Where Catesby erst with fashion'd splendor rose,
And bade her glitt'ring turrets pierce the sky.

'Tis pleasing thus to think what once you've been,
O Catesby! &mdash; ere the tooth of cankering Age
Impress'd the mark indelible, &mdash; your mien
Disfiguring thus with Time's corroding rage.

But now thy ruins, alder grown, I leave;
Haply some other Muse may tune the lay,
With nobler warmth o'er thy rude aspect grieve,
And live thro' ages in thy mourn'd decay.
