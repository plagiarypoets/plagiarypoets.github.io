Reade one, and say, tis good; I beare the name:
Reade one, and say, tis ill; I beare the shame:
If thou sayst, good, and think'st it too in heart,
Sweetely farewell, no matter who thou art:
If thou sayst meane, thou judgest like a frend,
I would be so, because I meane to mend:
If thou sayst, ill, and doost in heart dispraise it,
I yeeld not till I know a Wiseman saies it.
Thus quit me, or condemne me, Ile not grudge,
So that I know a foole be not my Judge.
Yours, William Bas.

A Shepheards youth dwelt on the plaines,
That passt the common sort of Swaines,
By how much had himselfe before
Beene nursed up in Colins lore;
Who, while his flocke, ybent to stray,
Glad of the Sunne-shine of the day,
Wanderd the field, and were abroade dispers'd,
He tooke his Pipe and sate him downe and vers'd.
