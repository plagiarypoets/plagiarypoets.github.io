When in the opening of the youthful Year,
Sol in Aquarius bathes his glistering Ray;
In early Morn the Fields all white appear,
With hoary Frost is cover'd every Spray:
And every Herb and every Grass is shent,
All in the chill Imprisonment ypent.

The mean-clad Swain, forth issuing from his Cot,
Looks sadly all around the whitening Waste;
And grieves that his poor Sheep, by Heaven forgot,
Can find no Food, no tender Green to taste:
He beats his Breast as one distract, or mad;
And home returns, with pensive Look and sad.

There silent grieves.  Then once again looks out,
And sees the Groves and Meads quite alter'd are.
The Sun has cast his melting Rays about,
And every Green appears more fresh and fair.
Then Hope returns, and Joy unknits his Brows,
And forth he leads his Flock the tender Grass to brouze.

Thus when my Fair One views me with Disdain,
My Heart is sunk within me, sad and dead;
My Spirits yield, and all my Soul's in Pain;
I sit and sigh, and hang my drooping Head:
But if she smile, my Sadness melts away,
Each gloomy Thought clears up, and I'm all blithe and gay.
