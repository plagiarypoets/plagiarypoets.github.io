AIR AND CHORUS.
Come then laughter loving power
Goddess of the festive hour,
Rosy mirth!  and bring along
Blithsome sport, and jocund song,
To welcome in th' auspicious day!
When glad Ierne tunes her harp to pay
To Charlotte's praise the tributary lay.

AIR.
With every brightest virtue crown'd,
Adorn'd with every grace,
She reigns, by graceful nations own'd
The Sovereign of her Race.

CHORUS.
Ye powers who watch o'er Britain's throne,
Look from your sphere of glory down!
Looke down and hear a peoples prayer!
Protect and guard this Royal Pair;
Charlotte and George by Heav'n design'd
To bless each other, and mankind.
Let no malignant cloud their days o'ercast,
But each new hour be happier than the last.

RECITATIVE.
And see! &mdash; Our prayers successful prove!
Another son has bless'd their love!

AIR.
May every happy year encrease
Those pledges of our future peace.
To guard and grace their parents throne,
With native virtues like their own.

DUETT.
So happy Charlotte, shall thy name
In Britain's latest annals shine;
Nor in her duty to thy fame
Shall pleased Ierne fail to join:
Ierne faithful to the Brunswick-line!

RECITATIVE.
Just to that faith, her Monarch's care
Has chosen Percy's honour'd heir,
Northumberland, with generous hand,
To deal his favours thro' the land,
Awe'd at the name wild tumults cease,
Ambitious feuds are hush'd in peace,
Concord, resumes her smiling reign,
With every blessing in her train.

CHORUS.
Come then laughter loving power
Goddess of the festive hour,
Rosy mirth!  and bring along
Blithsome sport, and jocund song,
To welcome in th' auspicious day!
When glad Ierne tunes her harp to pay
To Charlotte's praise the tributary lay.
