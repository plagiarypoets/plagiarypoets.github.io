O Susquehana's banks, where timber brash
Slumps in the flood with many a hideous crash,
Where boatable, she pours her waters bland
Thro' prairies green, and muggy bottom-land,
And waters in her course the sloshy swamp
That yields sweet meals of succotash and samp,
Two guessing Yankies met, slang-whangers both,
And men of gumption they, and nothing loth
To squale loose jaw, and slam an angry oath;
One a backwoodsman, who with axe and glut
Had built himself a handsome clapboard hut;
The other was a squatter, who was bent
From off his neighbour's land to tote a cent;
Both kedge and sprigh, and men that in a scrouge
Could jeopardize their foes, and neatly gouge.
Leaving his chore, thus the backwoodsman spoke:

BACKWOODSMAN:
So, Jonathan, a very pretty joke!
Are then my bottom-lands so rich and fat,
That you must come and on my prairie squat?
Once in a while it perhaps were no great matter,
To give some mush to some poor likely squatter;
But you're too clitchy, so I must confess
I fain would obligate you to a progress.

SQUATTER.
Progress!  you think a squatter may be trounced,
And patiently from post to pillar jounced.
But I'm a Yankee too, and to your loss
I'll shew you speedily you're not my boss,
Is't not enough to waste my strength and cunning,
Trying to get a scanty meal by gunning,
Wading thro' dismal swamps, and nearly spent,
But you must grudge your countryman a cent?
I'd have you know it's well I ask no more,
For Mister Jackson, when he gets the floor
In Congress, tells us that we all are men
And every Yankee is a citizen.
CAETERA DESUNT.
