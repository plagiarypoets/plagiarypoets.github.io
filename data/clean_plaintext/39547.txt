O lovely May!  when Spring's enchanting smile
Hath chas'd stern Winter's rugged frown away,
Thou comest on balmy zephyrs to our isle,
And all thy peerless charms thou dost display;
Soon Nature's in her richest plumage dress'd,
The feather'd songsters throng the shady grove,
Or on the blossom'd spray beside the nest
Responsive warble artless songs of love,
And strains harmonious fill the azure arch above.

Parent of Joy!  thou giv'st to life a zest!
At thy approach the vernal blooms expand!
The smiling orchard, rob'd in crimson vest,
Shews forth the wonders of thy magic hand!
And to the breeze which skims the verdant fields,
Where gayest flow'rets hill and dale adorn,
The hawthorn blossom pleasing fragrance yields
Sweet as the mossy rose, or dewy lawn
When Night's departing shades retreat before the dawn.

Gay beauteous nymph!  fair virgin of the year!
To view thy countless gems in rich array,
And all thy joyful melody to hear,
Is bliss on earth no language can pourtray!
Far sunk in sensuality's last stage
Must that man be that can unmov'd behold
The wide creation, God's instructive page,
Its lovely treasures to the eye unfold,
And can from Nature's God his gratitude withhold.
