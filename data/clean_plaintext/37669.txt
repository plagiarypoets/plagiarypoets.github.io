Arise, O Israel, know the Lord,
With flow'ry garlands strew the way;
A thousand victims, white and pure,
Upon the smoaking altars lay.
Profusely lavish all your store,
Confess the Godhead and adore:
With songs of praise your great Deliv'rer meet,
Unbounded as his love, and as his mercy sweet.

When winds and waves in conflict join,
And long the wat'ry war sustain,
'Tis he, who, cloath'd with dreadful pow'r,
Asserts the empire of the main,
Whilst o'er the billows back he strides,
Or in the furious eddy rides;
Old ocean at his voice begins to roar,
Rolls his insulting waves, and proudly braves the shore.

'Tis he the fatal shaft prepares,
Which does a guilty age controul;
His burst of thunder shakes the earth,
His subtle lightnings melt the soul;
The savage kind hear and obey;
And savage man, more fierce than they,
Whilst his red arm prepares the bolt to throw,
Flies from his wrath divine, and dreads th' impending blow.

His anger gives to winds their wings,
Which with their breath the forest rend;
Tall cedars split beneath the blast,
Or like the humble oziers bend;
In vain the herds to covert fly,
In vain they shun the piercing eye;
Ev'n Libanus and Sirion, whilst they hear,
Start at his awful voice, and wonder why they fear.

Happy Israel, chosen tribe!
With softer notes your hours beguile;
Tune ev'ry lyre to sing his praise,
Who makes the peaceful olive smile;
The happy fruit securely taste
Of glorious toils, and danger past.
HIs world shall cause destructive rage to cease,
And bind the jarring world in everlasting peace.
