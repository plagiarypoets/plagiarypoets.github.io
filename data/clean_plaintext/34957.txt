Now, courteous reader, say with what intent,
These drowsy ditties mean'st thou to peruse?
Certes, I wot, because thy mind thou'rt bent
With wassel flights of fancy to amuse.
But thy unweeting hopes will thee abuse;
For if thou look'st in this disporting strain,
To trace the footsteps of a sapient Muse,
Ah me!  thine expectations will be vain&mdash;
Ne wilt thou in it find great pleasance, eke nor pain.

But be not wroth &mdash; for these quaint roundelays
Withouten dulcet reed, a boyish elf
Did pen, nor smit with idle love of praise,
Nor did he court the Muse for dirty pelf,
But only sought to entertain himself:
And if devoid of worth thou dost them ween,
Eftsoons consign them to thy little shelf&mdash;
For ah!  forfend thou should'st annoy thine eyne,
His madrigals to read so meritless and mean!

He (stripling lad!) can boast no classic fire
To warble wild, or nip with satire's stripe,
Nathless he yet may learn to thrum the lyre,
When he with manhood's grace is fairly ripe.&mdash;
Meanwhile dull languor from thy mind to wipe,
Straight to thy shelf for Maister Spencer go,
Dan Pope, or Young, who deftly blew the pipe,
And hie to where the welt'ring waters flow,
And sit thee on a sod, and read their tales of woe.
