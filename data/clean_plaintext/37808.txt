Eternal Mountain!  whose unmeasured height
And desert bounds no human foot hath dared!
Whose hoary summit, robed in vestal white,
Inviolate soars &mdash; no mortal hath declared
The gloomy gulphs that scoop thy sides, where night
Eternal slumbers &mdash; where all hope was scared
From Him, who, rash to win an earthly name&mdash;
And prodigal of life &mdash; did tempt thy virgin fame!

He went &mdash; but did return no more! &mdash; thy snows
Became his winding-sheet &mdash; and to its source
His blood of life thy bitter breezes froze,
'Till the worn spirit fled his stiffening corse!&mdash;
Such was his doom &mdash; and such the doom of those
Who court renown by such adventurous course&mdash;
Ages have rolled &mdash; ages shall roll again,
But man shall never mete thy drear domain!&mdash;

All reckless thou beholdest the varying tide
Of time and seasons &mdash; whether winter frown,
Of spring, or summer, o'er the heavens preside&mdash;
Yet still to thee 'tis naught &mdash; still thou lookest down
Unchanged &mdash; unchangeable &mdash; lifeless, and wide,
And desolate, thou wearest thine icy crown,
Where suns that soar the wild pine at thy feet&mdash;
With moon-light radiance, cold &mdash; and scathless &mdash; beat!

Harmless o'er thee ten thousand suns have rolled&mdash;
And from thy girdle cataracts burst their way&mdash;
Yet still within thy mantle's icy fold
Dread winter reigns with an eternal sway!&mdash;
Far up the welkin shoots thy summit bold,
And far below thou seest the lightnings play&mdash;
Hearest the deep thunder bellowing round thy base,
While sun-bright splendour settles o'er thy radiant face!

Emblem of the Eternal &mdash; whose enduring steep
Of everlasting rock, shall proudly soar,
Till Ruin, with his rending arms, shall sweep
The world &mdash; and chaos mingle sea and shore,
Blend thy proud pathless summit with the deep,
And falling worlds proclaim that time is o'er!&mdash;
So long, eternal Mountain, shalt thou stand
The bulwark, and the boast, of this romantic Land.
