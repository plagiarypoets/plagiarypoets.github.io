Chill blows the wind &mdash; exhaling mists arise,
And cast a well o'er ev'ry prospect fair;
They shroud the glories of the purple skies,
And spread infection thro' the livid air.

But see the East it's portals wide display,&mdash;
Shot thro' with orient beams the gloom is fled;
See radiant Phoebus shine with crimson ray,
And o'er the world his golden mantle spread.

So to some Abbey's desolated cells,
Pale Superstition with her train retires,
Obsequious to religion's pow'rful spells,
And vanquish'd &mdash; howls amid the mould'ring spires.

There sombre discontent, with haggard eye,
Wanders at midnight hour thro' cloisters damp;
There melancholy heaves a plaintive sigh,
And chants late vespers o'er the paly lamp.

But mild religion, from her throne sublime,
Tells the wild waves of passion ne'er to roll;
Bids man aspire to gain th' etherial clime,
And cheers with heav'nly flame the drooping soul.

What time mild evening waves her banners grey,
Oft have I rov'd with wand'ring steps and slow,
Thro' scenes, where Hope extends a glimm'ring ray,
And try'd to ease th' oppressive weight of woe.

In vain &mdash; Oblivion's pow'rful hand deny'd
Her opiate balm to sooth my aching breast;
But sad remembrance, to despair ally'd,
Drove from my wakeful couch the curtain'd rest.

'Till bright religion heard my plaintive strain,&mdash;
She whisper'd comfort from her radiant state;
Taught by her gentle voice, I smil'd at pain,
And frown'd defiance on the storms of fate.

"Far from monastic ease &mdash; exert your pow'rs,
Go &mdash; close the wakeful eyes of pale distress;
Sooth the sad mind, which poignant grief devours,
And aid the cause of general happiness.

For know, beyond this vale of dire despair,
Knows, there's a clime, where heav'nly joys arise:
Where virtue shall sublime desires prepare,
And gleam with meteor ray beneath it's native skies.
