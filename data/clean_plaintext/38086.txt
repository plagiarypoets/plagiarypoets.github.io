Why blooms the radiance of the morning sky?
Why springs the beauties of the season round?
Why buds the blossom with the glossy die?
Ah!  why does nature beautify the ground?

Whilst softly floating on the Zephyr's wing,
The melting accents of the thrushes rise:
And all the heav'nly music of the spring,
Steal on the sense, and harmonize the skies.

When the rack'd soul is not attun'd to joy,
When sorrow an internal monarch reigns:
In vain the choiristers their powers employ,
'Tis hateful music, and discordant strains.

The velvet mantle of the skirted mead,
The rich varieties of Flora's pride,
Till the full bosom is from trouble freed,
Disgusts the eye, and bids the big tear glide.

Once, 'ere the gold-hair'd sun shot the new ray,
Through the grey twilight of the dubious morn,
To woodlands, lawns, and hills I took my way,
And listen'd to the echoes of the horn;

Dwelt on the prospect, sought the varied view,
Trac'd the meanders of the bubbling stream,
From joy to joy, uninterrupted flew,
And thought existence but a fairy dream.

Now thro' the gloomy cloister's length'ning way,
Thro' all the terror superstition frames,
I lose the minutes of the ling'ring day,
And view the night light up her pointed flames.

I dare the danger of the mould'ring wall,
Nor heed the arch that totters o'er my head:
O!  quickly may the friendly ruin fall,
Release me of my love, and strike me dead.

M***!  cruel, sweet, inexorable fair,
O!  must I unregarded seek the grave!
Must I from all my bosom holds, repair,
When one indulgent smile from thee, would save.

Let mercy plead my cause; and think!  O think!
A love like mine but ill deserves thy hate:
Remember, I am tott'ring on the brink,
Thy smile or censure seals my final fate.
