Time, awful power, that rulest o'er all;
By rich, by poor, unbribed, unpitying found;
Beneath whose arm triumphant heroes fall,
And golden palaces bestrew the desert ground:

Too long, whene'er thou hast renew'd
The flowery foliage, or matured the plain,
Have War, and Ruin fell, his hated brood,
And Death untimely, lower'd amid thy mournful train;

While daunted at thy brow severe
Spring check'd her joy, the bloom of Summer fled;
Autumn sate weeping on his sheaves, and near
Ev'n sullen Winter wore a thrilling gloom more dread.

O, as thou hold'st thy ceaseless course,
Grown milder now, great Power; with Peace combined,
Driving far off grim War, and lawless Force,
Thy formidable locks with lasting olive bind.

So may the fields revive, and late
Where Desolation triumph'd, Plenty reign:
By Fear withheld, though morning at his fate,
So may the labourer ply his cheerful toil again!

Calm Nature's voice, and wood-notes sweet,
The din of loud artillery succeed;
Commerce a world's returning treasure greet;
Nor sad Britannia more, begirt with trophies, bleed.
