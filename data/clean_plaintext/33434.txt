What fury has provok't thy wit to dare
With Diomed, to wound the queen of love
Thy mistris envy, or thine owne despair?
Not the just Pallus in thy breast did move,
So blind a rage with such a different fate,
He honour won, where thou hast purchast hate.

She gave assistance to his Trojan foe;
Thou that without a rivall thou maiest love,
Dost to the beauty of thy Lady owe,
While after her the gazing world does move.
Canst thou not be content to love alone,
Or is thy mistris not content with one?

Hast thou not read of Arthur's shield,
Which but disclos'd, amaz'd the weaker eyes
Of proudest foe, and won the doubtfull field?
So shall thy Rebell wit become her prize.
Should thy Iambecks swell into a book,
All were confuted with one Radiant look.

Heaven he oblig'd that place here in the skies,
Rewarding Phoebus, for inspiring so
His noble braine by likening to those eyes
His joyfull beams, but Phoebus is thy foe:
And neither ayds thy fancy nor thy sight,
So ill thou rim'st against so faire a light.
