Old Ludlow moulders 'neath the hand of age,
Grey worn her towers, and fall'n her battled heights;
Still lives her fame, for on th' historic page
Are stamp'd the glories of her antient fights.

Yes &mdash; Ludlow sinks in ruin's dark array,
Though Kings and Princes once have throng'd her halls;&mdash;
Though Britain's early senate there held sway,
And England's banners wav'd above her walls;

No more her gallery with loud music rings,
Where Cambrian harpers woke their song of glee,&mdash;
Where wither'd hands swept o'er the yielding strings,
And smiling beauties welcom'd minstrelsy.

No more the banquet throngs the woods around,
Where merry masquers danc'd beneath the stars,
And echo mock'd them with an endless sound,
And the moon lit them to their gallant wars.

Amidst the wreck and battlements o'erblown,
And crumbling columns, winter's voice doth howl,
There, where rude moss and ivy green have grown,
Flits the night bat, and solemn-seeming owl.

And oft the peasant, journeying on his way,
Starts into fear, and listens at the sound;
And when the sunk Sun calls from earth the day,
No lingering footstep dares to tread the ground.

The toiling spade, and the laborious plough,
Forcing their way through sand, and earth, and stones,
Oft find, sequester'd 'mid hoar roots below,
A conqueror's skull with parch'd and storm-worn bones,

A massy spear, a ponderous helm beside;&mdash;
A shrivell'd arm, once form'd the sword to wield;&mdash;
A trunk now 'rest of all its earthly pride,
Whose tongue spoke death and terror thro' the field;&mdash;

A coin, to which the stamp of time hath clung,
Which some crowned head, or learn'd inscription bore,
When camps and conquerors, kings and fame, were young:
Tis now effaced &mdash; and Glory lives no more.
