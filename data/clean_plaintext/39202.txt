Dear Stella, thou'rt friendly and kind;
My thanks, like fair Truth, are sincere:
I could almost say, curse on my mind,
If Ingratitude e'er harbour'd there!

The praises you're pleas'd to bestow,
Are too high for so humble a swain:
But your friendship has taught them to flow,
For my love to the Pride of the plain.

Believe me, I highly admire
Your goodness and candour conjoin'd:
O would ev'ry nymph but aspire
At such true elevation of mind!

Since my friendship so worthy you deem,
Your's gives a reciprocal joy:
The friendship that's built on esteem,
Is the friendship that never can cloy.

Gentle STELLA shall always be nigh,
Tho' distant as far as the Pole;
My regard will all distance defy;
Nor can time my affection controul.

Be each tender endearment to you,
In conjugal union join'd:
May your swain as the turtle be true;
May your offspring be gentle and kind.

Tune often your sweet flowing lays,
For your tears will serenely be spent;
The Muses have crown'd you with bays,
And virtue has giv'n you content.

Blest Wisdom thy paths will bestrew
With joy-buds of virtuous desire:
May ye late to the world bid adieu,
Then join the celestial choir.
