Take quantum sufficit of meadows and trees,
While your zephyrs most wantonly play in each breeze;
Let Phoebus and Flora together combine,
To make the sky smile, and the meadows look fine.
Your nymphs and your swains must be sorted in pairs;
Your swains should be love-sick, your nymphs be all fairs:
Let them prattle awhile, as their hay they are tedding;
Then wind up the whole with a church and a wedding.
But if grief elegiac you'd wish to assail,
Your prospect must lour, your swains must look pale:
Let Damon ask Corydon why droops his head;
If his Celia's unkind, or his lambkins are dead.
"No!" let him reply, "'tis not this gives me pain;
But young Colin is dead, the delight of the plain!"
Then let him invoke skies, angels, and saints,
Trees, meadows, and riv'lets, to join their complaints:
Till Damon, to ease him, and end these sad cries,
Assures him that Colin has mounted the skies.
From this kind assurance his mind is at ease,
And they hie to their cottage &mdash; to eat bread and cheese.
