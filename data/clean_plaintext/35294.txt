Placid and calm, the ev'ning shades descend,
And tranquil night draws on with sober pace;
Bright from the east what various colours blend,
Their burnish'd tints where Phoebus ends his race;
While, in a cloud, fair Dian shrouds her face,
Nor draws the veil till night assumes her reign;
But then shines forth, and beams her wonted grace,
Bright o'er each valley and each flowery plain,
Dispels dark horror from the silent night,
Beams peace in solitude and soft delight.

How sweet to wander to the woodland glade!
How sweet the uplands and each flowery dell!
How sweet, while shrouded in the placid shade,
To hear the strains of lonely philomel!
While active Fancy works her potent spell,
And quick Imagination lends her power,
To hear fair Echo sound her magic shell,
That breathes the requiem of the parting hour!
The tinkling wether homeward leads the flock,
And o'er the vallies sounds the village clock.

Ye sons of Pleasure, say the glittering crowd
That pass the hours of life in Folly's train;
Say, Fortune's favourites; say, ye pamper'd proud,
Such real enjoyments do ye ever gain?
Say, can your search of Pleasure e'er obtain
Such calm contentment and such tranquil joys?
Or midst your riots one short hour obtain,
Deprived of every thought that Peace annoys?
Ah, much I doubt, that Pleasure's glittering prize
You search in vain:  the fair Delusion flies.

Night's curtain draws, and Sol has sunk to rest:
The Queen of Night assumes her glorious reign:
Fast fly the colours from the glimmering west,
And Luna's beams spread o'er each hill and plain:
My humble cot once more will I regain,
Content and Pleasure reigning in my heart.
Oh may they ever in my breast remain,
And heal each wound that's made by sorrow's dart;
And may my eve of life like this be found,
With peace, sweet pleasure, and contentment crown'd.
