To you, Dear Will, who Politicks debate;
To you, who Poetry and Poets hate;
I, tho' the meanest, will their Cause defend,
And in the Art unskill'd, their Art defend.

You say, that thro' my slothful Course of Years,
One constant Inactivity appears;
With Syllables I sport, with Words I play,
And in soft Nonsense languish Life away.

Why do you thus of Poetry complain?
Why call it Sportings of an idle Brain?
Why censure that in Vigour of my Days,
I seek in Camps no honourable Praise?
Nor of the safer gainful Law make Choice,
And prostitute for Hire my venal Voice;
That, nor the quiet Priestly Gown can please,
Where I secure might batten at my Ease;
In some Cathedral Stall supinely drone,
With many Livings bless'd, reside at none:
When neither Fame in War, nor Wealth in Law,
Nor Ease in Priesthood my Affections draw;
Why do you bid me be to Physick led,
In gilded Car to triumph o'er the Dead;
With solemn Ignorance pretend to save,
And calmly send my Thousands to the Grave?
From Arts like these let meaner Souls seek Fame,
I'd make immortal as my Verse, my Name;
For honest Thoughts to future Ages known,
By sacred Verse, those Ages made my own.

DAN CHAUCER, Father of the British Song,
Tho' rough in Numbers, yet in Genius strong;
Supply'd by a nat'ral Strength the Want of Art,
Sedate his Soul, tho' merry was his Heart;
And while he gayly laugh'd, with honest Rage
He lash'd each Vice and Folly of his Age:
Hence, still of Cent'ries past through such a Length,
We view the Bard and wonder at his Strength;
With awful Rev'rence every Part behold,
The antique Diction venerably old,
The Mirth that's graceful, and the Wit that's bold.
Hence still he lives; shall still o'er Time prevail,
'Till Mirth, 'till Verse, 'till Time itself shall fail.

Nor shall SPENCER die, whose solemn Strain,
Of captive Virgins, and of Giants slain,
Of hardy Knights and valiant Deeds of Arms,
Of Fairy Castles, and of Magic Charms,
Can steal upon the Mind, 'till with Surprize
We view the whole romantic Vision rise:
Knights, Giants, Ladies, Monsters all around,
We traverse o'er the allegoric Ground;
Lost in a moral Trance awhile we seem,
And pleas'd enjoy th' imaginary Dream:
For this shall Fabling SPENSER live as long
As great ELIZA'S Name, to whom he sung;
The Poet thus shall with the Monarch claim
Divided Honour and immortal Fame,
'Till Arts, 'till Freedom are from Britain fled,
The MONARCH shall be lov'd, the POET read.

View next great SHAKESPEAR, Nature's darling Child,
Who warbled out his native Wood-notes wild;
From whom untaught all Learning seem'd to flow,
Man e'er possess'd or human Mind cou'd know;
No Slave to Rules, no Vassal to an Art,
With a free Genius still he reach'd the Heart:
And even where he least may give Delight,
Some lovely pictur'd Image charms the Sight;
From Nature's great Original he drew,
And though his Strokes seem artless, they are true:
With Nature's self unequall'd Poet vie,
Thy Works shall live 'till those of Nature die.

Great without Art tho' SHAKESPEAR was inspir'd,
For Art and Judgment JOHNSON is admir'd;
Studious in Rules he labours how to please,
That only to his Skill we wish him Ease:
Of Greece and Rome with all the Learning fraught,
To his own Britain he the Treasure brought;
Not that through want of Genius he was poor,
But willing to improve his native Store:
By this he hit on Comic Humour right,
And taught at once to profit and delight;
To make the Scene like real Life appear,
And represent Mankind just as they were:
Although some Scenes or Humours may seem strange
As Language varies, or as Manners change,
Yet he who to the Stage such Rules cou'd give,
From each succeeding Age shall Praise receive;
And while the rising Plot affects the Heart,
Pleasure and Admiration he will raise,
And, O rare Ben, still be the Poets Praise.

Nor crampt with JOHNSON'S more judicious Rules,
Too gay for Precepts of the Critic Schools:
BEAUMONT and FLETCHER jointly shew their Skill,
And move the softer Passions as they will;
Make the Heart sigh at their sad Tragic Strain,
Or glad it with their lighter Comic Vein:
Tho' little praise from Judgment they may claim,
On Force of Genius they have built their Fame;
Where Judgment fails, their Wit will touch the Heart,
And Nature's Force supply the Want of Art.

Next follows a long Train of Bards approv'd,
Who living were admir'd, who dead are lov'd;
Yet no Description but their own cou'd tell,
How all in various Beauties did excell.
Nat'ral and easy, SUCKLING wrote the Song;
WALLER more soft, more delicate, more strong
Soar'd to sublime, or in a gentle Strain
Of Sacharissa sung, but sung in vain:
COWLEY with lavish Wit his Mistress wrote,
Rich Treasures lay conceal'd in every Thought;
And though you take some Pains to get the Ore,
The more you study him you'll read the more:
Each Thought, each Line as you the Strider scan,
You see with the good Poet the good Man;
And though Perfection runs not through the whole,
Where you dislike the Verse, approve his Soul.

These and a Number more that I cou'd name,
Nobly recorded for Poetic Fame,
Live after Death beyond the Rage of Fate,
Prais'd by the Fair, the Brave, the Wise and Great:
O cou'd I but with half this Spirit write,
With half their Judgment give the World delight;
Instead of Wealth, with Pleasure wou'd I claim
The Poet's Honour with the Poet's Name.
