Hush'd is the fury of the wint'ry storm
Melodious murmurs warble through the wood;
The plain no longer shakes
Beneath the torrent's roar.

O THOU, whose bounty bids the meadows smile
With verdant bounty and with fragrant flowers,
Who deignest to adorn
All Nature with thy love!

THOU, whose high mandate sun and stars obey,
Sow in our bosoms those prolific seeds
Whence springs the heavenly flowers
Of gratitude divine.

From the full fountain of thy GRACE bedew
Our spirits; so the blossoms of thy love
Shall flourish in our hearts
In never-fading bloom.

And while the murmuring bee from flower to flower,
Assiduous, o'er the breathing garden flies,
Or sits on balmy thyme,
Extracting vernal sweets;

Still more assiduous in melliflous strains
This prostrate heart thy goodness would rehearse,
And with th' adoring world
Would glorify thy NAME!
