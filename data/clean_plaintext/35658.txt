Methinks I hear the band of saints above,
In holy anthem join'd, their voices raise
Tuning their golden harps to hymns of love,
While countless myriads swell the song of praise;
Descending sounds each flying zephyr seize,
Fill all the soften'd air, and float upon the breeze.

Perhaps resigning ev'ry loftier strain,
Angels may seek to heal the wounded heart;
And condescending to a mortal's pain,
Those sweeter tones their sympathy impart.
Indulgent zephyr then the message bring,
O hither bend thy course, and swiftly spread thy wing.

The charms of music yield to no controul,
Her soothing influence nothing shall destroy;
Some chord responsive vibrates in the soul,
And fills it with a soft, a pensive joy.
Each rougher feeling bends before her shrine,
Such everlasting power, sweet harmony, is thine.

O strike again those strings, ye gales of heav'n,
Again describe time's fading, dying joys;
Why then has expectation falsely giv'n,
Those insubstantial views, which time destroys?
Soft messenger of peace, again pourtray
The fleeting hopes of time, the visions of life's day.

From that sweet sound a secret pleasure springs,
Tho' still one sad resemblance I descry;
For as the breezes strike the trembling strings,
So hopes impress my soul, and so they die:
'Tis thus they bloom and fade, yet still I mourn,
Uncertain of their stay, or their return.

But tho' the passing joys of time shall fade,
Tho' transient lustre decks our little day;
Tho' varied sorrows may our peace invade,
And hope may give its intermitting ray;
Yet the rich fruit of all these woes may be,
To fix our nobler views on immortality.
