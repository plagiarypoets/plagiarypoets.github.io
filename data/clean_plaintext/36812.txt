At still midnight, within our wattled shieling,
'Twas wildly beautiful at times to hear
The Elephant his shrill reveille pealing,
Like some far signal trumpet on the ear:
Then, while the silvery moon was shining clear,
How fearful to look forth upon the woods,
And see the stately forest-kings appear
Emerging from those mountain solitudes&mdash;
As if that trump had woke Earth's old gigantic broods!
