That new-made Honour doth forget Men's Names,
Engrossed and happy in itself &mdash; is true;
But still my Want of Memory Pardon claims;
For mine is Honour great as well as new&mdash;
Honour to know, and to be known by, you.
Wonder not, then, that I should cast away
The common Stores that in the Memory grew;
That, GEORGE appearing, I should RICHARD say
Or tell the Moon's pale Light, "lo!  thine the glorious Day!"

But her best Treasures Memory still retains;
The Power of Beauty I remember yet;
Thy Smile for ever in the Soul remains,
And, though the Sun upon that Joy hath set,
Remembrance lives &mdash; it is my Pride, we met.
Oh!  could I give that Day its proper Fame,
Not distant Ages should those Hours forget,
When I thy Friend &mdash; allow the Word &mdash; became;
And Honours new or old shall not efface that Name.
