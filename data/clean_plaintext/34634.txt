While thro' irriguous meads pleas'd Isis stray'd,
Tame grew enamour'd of the watery maid
And, stealing silent o'er the flowery ground,
Threw his fond arms voluminous around
The virgin stream, now melting, soft, and kind,
And the pure waves in lasting union join'd.
Their mingled currents now one bed contains,
And leagued in love they wind along the plains.
Tame loves what-e'er sweet Isis can approve,
And every object shares their mutual love:
In sway united, and their streams the same,
In one fair flood they flow, and Tamisis the name.
