Ye groves, to Cambridge and to science dear,
Where revolving systems deep,
Newton was wont his hallow'd watch to keep:
Where Milton, with a flight sublime,
Soar'd beyond the bounds of time;
Heard ye the whisper in the passing gale?
Or did some spirit breathe the mournful tale?
That all your branches sigh'd o'er Sydney's bier!
Stript of your foliage by the chilling blast,
In tints of more than an autumnal brown,
Ye mourn those golden days are past,
When ye could call the favor'd youths your own,
But though within your consecrated shade,
Whilst Fancy's beams around them play,
No more there sons of Genius devious stray
In brighter beams array'd.
By Newton, Truth, and Wisdom, led
They drink of Science at the fountain head
In happier climes; nor other sorrow know
Than soft regret for those who wail their loss below.
