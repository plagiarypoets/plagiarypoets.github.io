Oft in the curious lore of antique time,
The tasteful reader beauty may espy,
Whether, or couched in prose, or stately rhyme,
There will the lover oft' be found to sigh,
And angel-woman, there, with lustrous eye
Radiant to gleam, while sparkling fancy, there,
Oft', to the raptur'd sense gives wings to fly
Thro' her elysium of conceptions fair,
With which gross mortal forms can ne'er compare;
The poet's heaven, where wrapp'd in blissful trance,
He bids a truce to sorrow and to care,
That to his chosen muse he may advance.
So Bacon, Barrow, Brown, and Benton shine,
So Milton glows intense, and Shakespear beams divine.
