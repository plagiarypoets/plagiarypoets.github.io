Forget thee?  Never; through life's remnant space,
Though peace is blasted, though hope's dream is o'er,
Still must the wizard wand of memory trace
The vivid past, and ever round me pour
The forms of things delusive, now no more!
Still, (banish vigorous thought, and high emprise,)
Like ocean-farer wrecked on some wild shore,
To that deceitful flood I turn my eyes,
When life's first, last, loved venture unforgotten lies.

Ah fool!  to hope for ever-sunny skies,
Nor know that nought but magic could invest,
With all the blooming hues of paradise,
The haunts where airy nothingness doth rest!
Mark, where the day's great angel, to the west
Receding, hovers o'er the unstable stream,
And dips his wing, like fabled islets blest,
Mark, how the clouds with transient glories gleam,
And on the wave reflect a bright, a parting beam.

That beam has gone; and hope and joy are fled,
And wild romance, and young-ey'd fancy's hour;
Bright visions leave me now, and in your stead,
Since thus it must be, let the darkness lour;
For chilling disappointment's leaden power
Has marr'd the genial current in these veins,
And given to desolation life's fair flower,
E'er since, fond listener to the syren's strain,
Of unrequited love, I proved the pointed pain.
