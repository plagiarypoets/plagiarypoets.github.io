My heart, &mdash; my heart, &mdash; oh!  cease forevermore
To beat, or cease to beat thus witheringly;
Bring the death-slumber of the silent shore,
Or from these hopeless struggles set me free.
Oh!  what avails it thus, &mdash; alas!  to be;&mdash;
Thus striving with immedicable pain;&mdash;
Now, on the silent waters of the sea,
In calmness that is ominous I sleep &mdash; again,
When the charged cloud has burst, whelmed in the tossing main.

My heart &mdash; my heart &mdash; alas!  for thee, my heart,
By each and all conflicting passions torn;&mdash;
And thou their battle-ground of ruin art,
Till the stern master passion home return;&mdash;
Resume the mastery, which must be borne
In solitude and silence, &mdash; and the groan,
Which wails the happiness himself hath shorn,
He mocks relentless from his savage throne,
Built on my utter wreck, &mdash; proud, ruthless, and alone.
