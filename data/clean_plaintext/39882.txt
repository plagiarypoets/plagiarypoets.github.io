And, even Woe, thy pensive "influence owns,"
Mixt with the rippling of the oozing cave;
While from the threat'ning rock
The boding raven croaks:

Or, when the maniac hears the owls' dire shriek,
The fragrance of the vale and fairy tones,
Ah, solemn maid!  in vain
Thy hushing zephyrs bear.

Save visions drear, what marks the unattun'd,
When village bells proclaim the dying hour;
Be it when winter howls,
Or summer's tribes buzz round:

Nor aught, grave Eve!  avail thy soften'd scenes,
If Melancholy shall perchance bear sway;
The heart thy coming hails,
And deepens still its woe:

While on the sunken tomb and letter'd floor,
Still shifting yew-shades trembling melt its gloom,
As o'er the moon the breeze
Drifts wild the sable clouds;

And from the ruin'd aisle and yawning vault,
The varying voice of horror whispering creeps,
Oft as the neighb'ring grove
With awful rustling waves:

Or, on the promontory's shaggy verge,
Hung o'er the ceaseless boiling pool below,
While from the beetling cliff
Collected torrents pour.

If hideous spectre glare, and paly gleams
Flash round and frequent on the frenzied eye!
Lost are thy charms, O Eve!
Upon the maddening soul.

Yet, "gentle Evening mild!"  sweet is thy power,
When peace and feeling meet; thy sombrous sounds
In cooling breezes borne,
With all thy soothing train.
