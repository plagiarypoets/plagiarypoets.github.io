Ye that have hearts vex'd with unquiet thought
Of worldly grievance, and of lost delight:
Oh!  turn to Spenser's Faery Tale, &mdash; so fraught
With all that's mild, and beautiful, and bright,&mdash;
There revel in the fancies he hath wrought,&mdash;
Fancies more fair than May, &mdash; or morning light,&mdash;
Or solitary star awake at night,&mdash;
Or breath from Lover's lips in kisses caught.
Sweet Spenser!  how I love the faery pages,&mdash;
Where gentle Una lives so radiantly;
Fair is thy record of romantic ages,
And calm and pure the pleasure which it yields:
While life and thought are with me, &mdash; thou shalt be
My dear compainion in the silent fields.
