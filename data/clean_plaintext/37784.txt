Hail, meek-ey'd Patience, heavenly maid,
But sent to earth to mortals aid,
To teach them to endure
The many ills which wait below
In close succession still, and know
From death alone a cure!
Hail, Patience, and with thee Content,
That ever pleas'd with blessings sent,
The woes of fate beguiles;
And Meekness too, with placid mien,
With brow unalter'd and serene,
That e'en in sorrow smiles:
And Fortitude attend thy train,
Superior to the ills of pain,
That still defies the stroke;
And Resignation too be there,
In silence skill'd each ill to bear,
And bow beneath the yoke!
Be these in every scene display'd,
When fainting Nature calls for aid,
And with them Hope be given,
That through misfortunes darkest sky
Emits a beam to cheer the eye,
And paint the path to Heaven.
