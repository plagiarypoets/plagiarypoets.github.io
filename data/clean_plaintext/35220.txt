Go, faithful transcripts of a tender heart,
To fair Melinda go, my love proclaim,
The melting anguish of my mind impart,
And (if ye can) inspire a mutual flame.
But should the fair one my presumption blame,
Oh pour this soothing maxim in her ear,
In love, as war, timidity is shame,
Superiour souls in lofty hopes appear.
As flees the dastard from the hostile spear,
So shuns the wretch of mean ungen'rous mind;
Struck with a baser dread &mdash; a mental fear,
Superiour worth with matchless charms combin'd.
The greatest dangers gen'rous heroes dare,
The boldest lover always wins the fair.
