Smit with a theme, beyond the Aonian lore,
Beyond the Roman, or the Grecian fire,
The flights of Milton's British genius soar,
Where the rapt Seraph tunes his golden lyre,
And wakes such strains, as infant Nature heard,
When first her atoms glow'd beneath the Omnific Word!

Borne on the expansion of his wing sublime,
He sees the angelic legions rush to war!
Sees Michael flaming through the ethereal clime,
And Satan towering in his sun-bright car!
Sees, in mid heaven, the fiery conflict rise,
Permitted to decide the empire of the skies!

Wide-streaming with celestial glory bright,
The advancing Ensign of Messiah flames!
He comes, terrific in paternal might!
Afar, his coming, power divine proclaims!
Wrapp'd in red wrath he shakes the empyreal poles,
And dreadful, heard remote, the mustering thunder rolls!
