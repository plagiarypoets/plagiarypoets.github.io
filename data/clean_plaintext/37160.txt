At the foot of the hill where the hamlet smokes,
Two peasants once happily met;
What rural simplicity flow'd in their jokes,
All on the green turf as they sat.

Old David was bow'd beneath fourscore of years,
And William was threescore and ten;
Their brows they were wrinkl'd, and hoary their hairs,
And long they had dwelt in the glen.

David's father's grandfather liv'd on the spot
Their hoary successor retains;
The eighth generation now graces the spot
Where rural felicity reigns.

There pride nor ambition no entrance could get,
Sobriety guarded the door;
Their honest industry still found a retreat,
And plenty sat smiling secure.

Their sweet mutual confidence always had sooth'd
Their bosoms when burden'd with care;
The smiles of pure friendship their toils often smooth'd,
And their kindly salute was sincere.

WILLIE.
Guid-day, auld birkie, fu gaes a',
Ye dinna sleep your time awa'.

DAVIE.
Tho' now-a-days I'm unco crazy,
I never was ca'd sweer nor lazy.
I'm blythe to see you, come awa'
An' gi'e's your cracks an hour or twa.

WILLIE.
Believe me, Davy, as ye like,
I saw ye loutin' o'er the dyke:
Troth I was fain to see ye there,
An' as I had an hour to spare,
I just cam' hirplin' o'er the know,
Wi' guid intent to spen't wi' you.

DAVIE.
An' welcome, lad:  fu's a' your folk,
I hope they 're up an' at the yoke?

WILLIE.
I gi'e ye thanks, they're a' meat hale:
Jock's i' the yoke, an' at the hill,
An' Tibby's cawn the sheep out by,
An' Meg is milkin' at the ky,
Auld Marrion's busy at the churn,
An' ilka ane is at their turn.

DAVIE.
Weel, Willie man, fan blest wi' health,
That's just the way to gather wealth;
An' diligence, we aften see,
Tends to secure prosperity:
Industry brings its ain reward,
An' folks wi' frugal care sud guard
Whatever Providence has sent them&mdash;
Just for a time it's only lent them.

WILLIE.
I sall allow you're i' the right o' 't,
But some are keepit rather tight o' 't.

DAVIE.
An' sae they sud wha canna guide it,
But spends 't as fast as they provide it;
An' careless chiels wha tak nae tent,
Their penny-siller's shortly spent.

WILLIE.
But fortune, Davy, fortune, man,
Fu' aften blasts the wisest plan
That human prudence can contrive,
An' nane but fortune's fav'rites thrive;
An' some, ye ken, wha's fortune's pet,
They'll gather gear tho' scant o' wit.

DAVIE.
I true sae, Willie, that's the gate
Wi' sic as you, wha has nae wit:
Dame fortune's sure to get the blame,
Fan things nae gain' right at hame.
Puir jad!  she gets enough laid till her,
Altho' she disna steal our siller.
She's blam'd for blastin' o' our gear,
In spite o' a' our can an' care.

WILLIE.
Davy, lad, that's e'en o'er true,
I wat her frowns aft gar us rue;
An' o' her smiles we need na brag,
She's sic a fashious fickle hag.

DAVIE.
Dame fortune, fate, an' chance, an' luck,
Is ay in unco vogue wi' folk:
We seldom hear ae word ava
O' Providence, that rules our a'.
That's just the han' decrees our lot,
Gin we sud ne'er he worth a groat.

WILLIE.
Fairfa' thee, neipor, I'll allow
That ye hae fairly guest it now:
We seldom differ a' our days;
An' Solomon, the wisest, says,
A frien' sticks closer than a brither,
An' sae we we to ane anither.

DAVIE.
Hale forty years we've been acquaint,
An' ay seem'd unco well content,
Wi' open, free, an' honest heart,
Our bosom secrets to impart;
An' aften, whan opprest wi' grief,
Our mutual friendship ga'e relief:
That confidence was ne'er betray'd,
That we in ane anither had:
Whate'er we sold, or what we bought,
Our plighted word was a' we sought:
That word was seal'd by shakin' han's,
Car'd nought about their bills nor ban's.

WILLIE.
I true sae, lad; but ye, maun ken
That ilka gouk has now his pen:
I wat fu' weel, in days o' yore,
There was na ane amang a score
Wha kent the use o' pen an' ink:
Yet honesty an' ready clink
Was mair in vogue, I sall avow,
Than a' their bits o' paper now.

DAVIE.
Nae yellow Geordies now, I ween,
Nor sonsie siller crowns are seen;
They 're a' stow'd up in banks an' boxes,
Syne wi' their screeds o' paper mock us:
They pay us for our goods an' wark
Wi' flirds ye 'mith blaw o'er the kirk!
Sic feckless trock!  the sorrow eat them!
It's nae great won'er tho' I hate them.

WILLIE.
I trow ye've heard it said lang syne,
Our dear-bought wit we seldom tyne:
I've paid for wit sin' last I saw you&mdash;
Lat never sic mishap befa' you!
Experience, lad, 's the best o' schools,
That aften teaches thoughtless fools;
Whan precept an' example's lost,
They come in end to pay the cost;
Syne jeer'd on by the maist o' folk,
An' made a common laughin' stock.

DAVIE.
Weel, Willie man, there's something o' 't;
But he's a simple silly sot,
An' whiles has something to regret,
Wha tak's na care whar he is set.

WILLIE.
Ha, ha, auld gossip!  I muckle doubt
Ye've heard what I ha'e been about:
Some idle gawkie ye ha'e seen,
Has tald ye a' that I ha'e deen;
An', ablins, tald ye mair nor's true&mdash;
But ye sall ha'e the bale o' 't now.

DAVIE.
E'en dee sae, man, I lang to hear 't,
An' yet I did na like to spear't:
He does a frien' but ill deserve,
That's stintet sae wi' stiff reserve:
True friendship's open, plain, an' free,
Nor stintet wi' hypocrisy;
An' whar we fin' it is sincere,
It smores a' diffidence an' fear;
An' in the bosom whar it dwells,
There tender sympathy prevails;
An' mair out o'er, twa hearts that's leal,
Are ay fu' happy to reveal
Whatever braks their inward peace,
Whan folks can read it in their face:
'Twas there I fairly read your grief,
Sae out wi' 't, man, an' get relief:
Ye dinna ken, nor can ye say,
Fu far a frien's advice may gae.

WILLIE.
O had I been advis'd by you,
I wad na had sic cause to rue:
My marriage, man, ah!  wae's me for 't!
Has deen me muckle skaith an' hurt:
For athing out an' in's to wrack&mdash;
But yesterday will ne'er come back.
Repentance aft comes rather late,
An' sic is my unlucky fate.
My peace an' comfort now are fled,
An' ruthless care's come in their stead.
My bleatin' flock is sair decay'd;
And sax milk ky that ance I had,
Now dwindl'd down to twa or three,
An' thrift is fairly fled frae me.
I've brought a moth amang my gear;
Cauld poverty will soon appear.

DAVIE.
Ye've brew'd a broust, sae ye maun drink it;
I'm wae to say't, for ance your blinket:
I saw't as clear's I see my thum',
To what your want o' wit wad come;
An' whan a frien' wad interfere,
Ye stapt your lugs an' wad na hear.
Gin ye but saw fu it appears,
Sic folly in your length o' years.
Wha ance ye thought was blest wi' grace,
I doubt she wears anither face.

WILLIE.
Wow, what ye tald me lang before,
I trow has now come to my door
An' every day, wi' grief, I see
The fast approach o' misery.
Nae sporting ca'r upo' the lee,
Nae rising stock that's comin' tee;
Twa score o' lam's I had ilk year,
Will scantly count the half, I fear.
My butter, cheese, an' curns o' woo,
Are sell't an' spent, I watna fu.
The wobs o' sey my Elspa left,
An' claith o' every kind's adrift.

DAVIE.
Your Elspa, Willie, ay took care
To claith you in good hame-spun gear;
An' now whan Elspa's worn awa',
Ye've gotten ane nae doubt mair braw;
There's mony mair mista'en nor me,
Gin e'er she fill your Elspa's shee.

WILLIE.
Na, Davy, na, I wadna hear,
Tho' ye was friendly an' sincere;
I took my will, and now maun dree
Whate'er my folly's brought on 'o me.
Gi'e her the needle, thread, an' shears,
For naething out nor in she cares.
Fu' easy like she steps about,
An' bores awa' at some white clout.

DAVIE.
I true sae, Willie:  gi'e Jean her seam,
She'll lat you see that she's nae lame,
In sortin' up her furbelaws,
An' wow at makin' ladies braws;
She dings them a' at cap or bonnet,
Gin ance her han'y wark gae on it:
But set her out to barn or kiln,
The riddle, sieve, or to the mill,
To carry seed whan it's a-sawin',
Or to the rig whan it's a-mawin',
I fear she'll puirly mak' a shift,
Wi' jots o' wark o' ony thrift.
Whan i' the house, she'll ha'e nae will
To fash wi' cards or spinnin' wheel.

WILLIE.
Now cards an' wheel are baith dismist,
For madam cud na thole the dust;
Nor yet the smell o' creeshie woo',
But what they're like to gar her spue.
My sister, Marion, winna bide,
She's for awa', whate'er betide.
I thought to keep her a' her days,
An' gi'e her meat an' duds o' claise;
For a' her wark she sought nae mair,
Tho' ident at it late an' ear'.
A pleasant word she canna gi'e her,
Nor can the limmer thole to see her!
The warld's upside down wi' me,
My folly now I plainly see.

DAVIE.
O Willie, Willie, ye was misled,
To fix an' ty your auld grey head
To sic a capernoited elf,
Wha aim'd at naething but your pelf.
She's up in years, I maun allow,
But was nae bred for sic as you.
I've heard it said, the willow wan',
Whan young an' green, is easy thrawn;
Whan time an' habit gi'es 't a set,
It winna bend wi' ease, I wat.
She's e'en a sour camsteerie jade!
She winna be that easy made.

WILLIE.
To mak' her, Davy's, past my skill:
For gin she disna get her will,
She hings her mou', and tak's the pet,
Syne fint a word ava we get;
An' a' thing's wrang, an' naething right,
That's in her road or in her sight.

DAVIE.
Ah!  waesocks, Willie, you're ill be-sted,
I did na think it half sae bad;
I whiles was hearin' something o' 't,
An' pitied your wanchancie lot.
Believe me, man, my heart's fu' sair,
An, yet there is nae help, I fear.
Sae that's your Jean urn'd inside out,
Ye did na see her till now, I doubt.
Mass John, her brither, was nae blate,
To buckle you wi' sic a cheat;
He kent fu' weel ilk fau't an' failin'.
For she's been lang about his mailin';
An' bein' a maiden auld an' stell,
His Rev'rence thought she mith do well.
Marriage may change a woman's nature,
But, faith, it's seldom to the better.
Auld maidens, ance they're past the date,
Are gi'en to murmur, frown, an' fret:
But as you're fairly buckl'd wi' her,
An' has the wedlock pledge to gi'e her,
An' that, ye ken, 's a coothie heart,
An' ay to act a manly part:
Consider, Willie, that's the point,
Without it a' thing's out o' joint.

WILLIE.
She kens fu' weel what I possess,
An' ilka, day she's makin' it less;
For what I had in's honour's han',
A toumon syne is a' maist drawn.

DAVIE.
But, Willie, ye had somethithing bankit.

WILLIE.
It's hale an' fair, sae Guid be thankit:
Sae lat the hag dee what she will,
I'll dee my best to keep it hale;
It's a' that I can ca' my ain,
Any there, I trust, it sall remain;
I'll strive fu muckle mair to mak' it,
For she sall never thum' a plack o' 't;
An 'gin the graceless spendthrift kent,
The hindmost penny wad be spent.
Twa hunner poun is just the sum,
'Twill stan' in stead gin poortith come;
An' come it will, I plainly see.
For she is bent to ruin me:
Sae, neipor, ye maun keep the bill,
Nane kens this secret but yoursel'.

DAVIE.
Believe me, lad, I'll do my best
To keep this secret in my breast.
Content an' peace has been my luck;
I've ay been like my neipour folk.
Nae o'er far up by fortune hoist,
Nor o'er sair down by poortith squeezt.
Whate'er degree o' wealth be sent us,
Gin health an' sweet content be lent us,
Wi' that, a mod'rate competence
Is ay preferr'd by folks o' sense,
To thousands they cud never use,
An' thousands they mith e'en abuse.
Wealth seldom points the way to bliss;
An' folks o' wealth fu' aften miss
The objects they wad fain enjoy,
Altho' that mith their peace destroy.

WILLIE.
Ye've trampit now on my sair heel;
I cudna had whan I was weel,
Whan peace smil'd roun' my social fire,
An' a' was deen at my desire.
Whare pride an' mad ambition dwells,
There haggard discord ay prevails.
O Davy, Davy, sad's my change!
An' wow to me it's unco strange,
Wha ay had peace an' full content,
An' nae a boddle e'er misspent.
The produce o' her hens an' ky,
Her tea an' sucker winna buy:
She's gotten a' the trinkets for 't,
O' ilka shape an' ilka sort:
Braw painted pigs wi' gowden lips,
Instead o' timmer cogs an' caps;
A copper kettle o' the wa',
An' wow we're gettin' wond'rous braw.

DAVIE.
Wha sees their bargain or they mak' it,
Be 't guid or ill, gin ance they tak' it,
An' mak' the pennyworth their ain,
Folk sudna murmur nor complain.
There's some blawn up wi' self-conceit,
An' others, think they're nae just blate:
The chiel that's wise beyond controul,
Fu' aften proves the greatest fool.

WILLIE.
Ah!  waes me for't!  that's ae snaw-ba',
I sanna tak' it ill ava.
Now tent me man: &mdash; Ae night, last owk,
A sly an' wily plan I took:
But ablins ye ha'e heard o' this.
An' thinks I naething did amiss.

DAVIE.
An' that I did, an' leugh my fill;
I sall avow ye manag'd well;
An' maist o' folk commends ye for't,
But some, I doubt, thought it nae sport,
Now frae yoursel' I wis' to ha'e 't,
An' sae I'm sure the truth I'll get.

WILLIE.
Ye'll get it a', gin time permit,
But we maun shortly start to foot:
The day's far up, sae we must part,
We'll shortly meet gin a' be spar't.
A boddie, Davy, fin's relief,
Whan to a frien' they vent their grief.
Some cummers, by her invitation,
Had a' conven'd for recreation,
To spend 'o an orrow hour or sae,
An' get a sup o' Jeanie's tea.
They steppit butt as in they cam',
An' ilka cummer gat her dram.
Wow, fat o' compliments was gi'en,
Fu' gleeb the frien'ly phrases ran,
Wi' mistress this, an' mistress that,
An' ilka ane their honours gat.
Syne a' the news baith far any near,
Frae kirk an' market's gather'd here:
Fu mony pair was cried on Sunday,
An' wha's bridegroom an' bride on Monday.
Now ane explains the powerful art
To win an' keep a husband's heart,
An' fu a prudent wife, wi' ease,
Mith, wi' a smile, her husband please:
Ane tells fu mony lads she had,
An' wow fu well she was provid';
Fu chaste an' modest she behav'd;
An' ane, fu mony she deceiv'd:
Anither brags fat she brought wi' her,
An' fu his honour comes to see her:
Some cracks awa' about their marriage,
An some, the cause o' their miscarriage.
Anither glass gaed roun' them a',
But I was fain to win awa'.
I drank their healths, but car'd na by,
For I was drumly, sour, an' dry.
Sae benn I cam', an' left the cummers,
A pack o' scandilizing limmers!
Says to mysel', I'll need some caution
To put my plan in execution.
The kettle's now upo' the fire;
Sae to the barn I did retire,
Tobacco box, my knife, an' a',
An' shear'd it, unco fine an' sma'.
Syne in I cam', an' down I sat,
Till I a canny minute gat:
For I was mendin' at a sack,
An' left it there till I cam' back.
Now benn the floor she comes at last,
An' in her snout a waefu' blast!
Thinks I, there'll shortly rise a spree,
That storm is sure to fa' on me.
I gat some taunts baith sour an' snell,
That night fu I had shown mysel';
Affronted her an' a' the rest,
Ca'd me a rude unpolish'd beast.
She striv'd a wee to smore her spleen,
An' hide it frae the wives a-benn;
An' at the time she said but little,
As she was waitin' on the kettle.
The kettle's boil'd, the tea is maskit,
An' now I had a fearfu' task o' 't.
The pottie on the bink was set,
Syne butt the floor she took the gate;
Thinks I, there is nae time to lose,
Sae i' the pot slipt in the dose;
Says to mysel', I'm fairly rid o' 't,
Fatever after may betide o' 't.

DAVIE.
Weel manag'd, lad, I sall admit.

WILLIE.
Behad, the sport's but comin' yet:
The table now was spread wi' plenty,
Wi' a' thing unco nice an' dainty;
Fine buns an' biscuit, loaf and a',
An sucker white as driven snaw;
An' some red trock, they ca'd it jam,
I didna ken whare frae it cam';
Sweet butter, just as yellow's gowd,
I thought it a' was ill bestow'd;
(You're sure I wasna sair content,
For this was far frae use an' wont;)
An oval broad, fu' nicely paintit,
Frae Lon'on town her brither sent it;
There Bonaparte on horseback stood,
An' a' the sides o' 't stript wi' gowd:
Sae on the broad, in taste an' stile,
The pigs were plac'd a' rank an' file;
Her siller cutties glancin' clear,
Seem'd proud to tell she brought them wi' her.
Ance mair I beet gae face the thrang,
But Davy, lad, I badena lang;
As little said fan I was there,
Fu to get forth was a' my care.
An' now the tea is just in han',
But mark fat follow'd after, man:
Whan first the cup gaed fairly roun',
The tea's o'er strong, says cummer Brown;
It's rather harsh, quo' cummer Shaw,
It winna do wi' me ava;
Quo' cummer Black, the millert's mither,
It disna fit my palate neither;
Quo' I, sirs, gi'e't baith ream, an' sucker,
An' mak' it sweet gin it be bitter;
Quo' Jean, I'm sure it's of the best,
I'm wae it disna fit your taste;
I mixt some grains o' guid green tea
Amang the very best bohea;
His presence, sirs!  cried cummer Smart,
It's ta'en me by the very heart:
Syne up gat Jean, an' took the pot,
An' in a passion forth she got,
An' threw its contents i' the close&mdash;
Thinks I, my lass, there is nae loss;
I'll strive to spen' you frae that trash,
That eats awa' sae muckle cash.
Before she cud win ben again,
For sickness cudna stan' her lane;
Wi' put an' row she gat her bed,
An' some beet haud their neipor's head.
Meg Brown, wi' grippin' by the hawls,
Just forth to get the air she crawls.
An'now some hameward took the get.
Tarn Brown' his wife maist half way met;
An' whan he saw his Meg sae dizzie,
Quo' Tam, ye, filthy drunken hussy!
Ye canna keep your feet the gether,
The road it winna baud you neither; 
An' ay whan Meg wad mint to spue,
He bann'd her for a drunken sow:
For Meg, ye ken, a glass can tip,
An' Tam himsel' whiles tak's a sup.
Now Janet Smart, an' Nanny Shaw,
Seem'd unco fain to win awa';
They grippet fast by ane anither.
The millert now cam' for his mither.
Sae I gat rid o' a' but Jean,
An' she's enough for me her lane.

DAVIE.
Weel, Willie, gin your plan succeed,
To spen' her frae that foreign weed,
Ye'll be reputed for a wit.
Nae langer, Willie, we maun sit.
I wat ye've gi'en's an unco tale;
I'll be as honest, true, an' leal,
To a' your secrets as yoursel'.
Syne baith shook han's, an' bade farewell.
