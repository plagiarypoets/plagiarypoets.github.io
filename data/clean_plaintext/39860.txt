ENVY IS INTRODUCED AFTER REVENGE.
"While each strain'd ball of sight seem'd bursting from his head!"

Foul ENVY heard,
And onward came!
Her angry snakes were all upreared!
She belch'd a flame
Of stygian fire,
Her croaking throat was swoln with ire&mdash;
Her temples bound
With asps around,
And scorpion's hiss'd
Upon her breast,
And light'nings from her eyes appear'd!
She wild advanc'd,
And madly glanc'd
Her eye, to find some dismal shell:&mdash;
But seeing none of fitly sound,
She rais'd a most tremendous yell,
And poison rank exhal'd around!

THE MANIAC IS INTRODUCED AT THE END, AFTER,
"And he, amid the frolic play&mdash;
As if he would the charming air repay,
Shook thousand odours from his dewy wings!"

But as the little god in rapture smil'd,
On rush'd in fury, from a nook retir'd,
With haggar'd look, and air and gestures wild,
A love-lorn MANIAC with mad phrensy fir'd!
His step was hasty now, and now delay'd!&mdash;
He grasp'd a dagger in his trembling hand!
Seem'd desperate now, and now appear'd afraid!
And now he gnash'd his teeth, and madly shook his brand!
First he beat loudly on the hollow drum,
Then blew a blast upon the clarion shrill;
Then stood a moment motionless and dumb,
As tho' himself were stone &mdash; inanimate and chill!
But as subsided the delirious fire,
His brow relax'd &mdash; his eye more mildly beam'd:
And calm he seem'd,
As tho' all undisturb'd by love or ire.
Then with a placid smile&mdash;
Tears wet his cheeks the while,
He gently took the sweet, melodious lyre;
And softly and serenely play'd!
The notes harmonious rung,
As o'er the cords his fingers stray'd,
And sweeter still he sung&mdash;

"O, she was fair &mdash; divinely fair!
Was all my love &mdash; was all my care!
When I was sad, she sigh'd for me!
When I was glad, she smil'd with me!
Upon my lips how oft she hung!
How kind the music of her tongue,
When lying on my breast,
With melting look, she all her love confess'd
Where now is she?
O Death!  O misery!
Those foul, perfidious charms,
Now fill a rival's arms!&mdash;
Those lips that gave me kisses,
Now!  Now!  a rival presses!"

Then fierce again became his look,
Again his naked blade he shook,
And plunged him head-long on the ground!
Then started up, and wildly gaz'd around!
And rag'd! &mdash; and foam'd! &mdash; and frantic tore his hair!
Exclaiming &mdash; "Death! &mdash; Damnation! &mdash; Hell! &mdash; Despair!
O!  horror! &mdash; vengeance! &mdash; murder! &mdash; O!
Let go my heart! &mdash; Mad Demon!  let me go!&mdash;
Ha! &mdash; Ha! &mdash; Ha! &mdash; Ha! &mdash; ha!  ha!  ha!  ha!
Away, foul Fiend! &mdash; away! &mdash; away!
Dost still pursue? &mdash; Then let me die!"

Thus saying, he raised his steel on high,
And plung'd it downward furiously!
It reach'd his heart &mdash; he drew it out,
And from the gaping wound the warm life's blood did spout!
Groans, stifled groans! &mdash; sighs, interdicted sighs!
His cheeks grew pale! &mdash; his senses reel'd around!
The shades of death came o'er his hollow eyes&mdash;
He stagger'd! &mdash; tumbled! &mdash; died upon the ground!
