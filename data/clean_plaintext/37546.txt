What sound, wide trembling on the passing gale,
Arrests the startled soul with sudden dread?
The knell of fate!  and, lo!  a victim pale
Borne to the silent mansions of the dead.

'Tis he, whose bark, late driving in the breeze,
Rode proudly buoyant on life's swelling wave;
Which, while it gaily shone and mock'd the seas,
Sank in the treacherous whirlpool of the grave.

See, round the corse the list'ning rustics stand,
In thought mysterious wrapt and holy dread;
While fear on every face, with livid hand,
Pourtrays a short resemblance with the dead.

Lost for a while is all their former mirth,
And every ray that brighten'd life is gone;
The scenes of nature fade, while, far from earth,
They wander, trembling on a world unknown.

Oh!  hear that warning voice, and dare to trust
In those celestial worlds in mercy given;
Which, while they humble man to kindred dust,
On Hope's strong pinions lift his soul to Heav'n.

But fly, ye sons of Dissipation, fly
Th' awakening sounds, and shun intrusive care;
Repress the tear of grace; &mdash; the struggling sigh:
Nor rouse the slumbering conscience to despair.

Fly &mdash; lest contrition from your breasts should pour
This prayer (which soon may flow for you and me):
Lord, suffer not, in this our mortal hour,
For any pangs of death to fall from thee.
