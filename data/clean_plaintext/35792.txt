Yet as the foe flies panting through the gloom,
E'en still he fears the o'ertaking sword may fall
Full on his crest, and seal his hapless doom.
So the lorn wretch, whom evening shades enthral,
Wandring 'mid Alpine precipices tall,
The Avalanche dreads; and though perchance he go
Unharm'd the steeps beyond, his senses all
Dwell on the danger, and the impending snow
To him yet seems to threat his wildered course below.
