Mild eye of pensive Eve!  effulgent moon!
I hail thy placid beams, I hail the hour
When Rest, with mystic spell,
All busy tumult stills.

When, stealing from the lulling arms of sleep,
I pace the dewy verdure of the lawn,
And view, with raptured gaze,
The soft Elysian scene.

View woods, dark-cloathing the retired vale,
And sinuous rivers, glimm'ring thro' the mist,
That o'er the daedal earth
A fleecy mantle throws.

Etherial orb!  that gilds the humble thatch,
Or tree embosom'd fane, or mountain grey,
Or in the distance dim
Gilds Ocean's heaving breast;

Beneath thy ling'ring beams I love to pause,
And mark the melting softness which pervades,
The landscape's features bland,
With many a magic tint.

But more amid some hallowed pile to sit
Where humbled grandeur prompts the feeling sigh,
And dark mysterious lore
The rapt attention holds.

Where old tradition consecrates the place
To pallid Fear, and tells of murd'rous acts,
Of spectres dimly seen,
Or Fairies' nightly haunt,

Where, rudely clust'ring on the tott'ring wall,
The ivy twinkles to thy gladd'ning rays;
And o'er the crumbling mass
The graceful ash depends.

Thy reign, chaste Moon!  no sounds profane invade,
But wafting peace, the curfew's simple toll,
Or gushing rill, or note
Of Night's melodious bird.

A while thy sober disk the rolling clouds
O'erspread with transient darkness, and forbid
Thy cheering face to smile,
And bless the mournful scene.

But now, slow rising from the sombre shades,
Thy silent lustre bursts with kindled charms,
And on the joyous sight
A flood of radiance pours.

E'en so shall Virtue, when involving death
Spreads his chill gloomy terrors o'er her form,
Triumphant o'er the grave
Resume her holy sway.

Again, with purest glory crown'd, rejoice
Amid the full seraphic choir of heav'n,
And beam, like thee fair Moon,
Sweet mildness down on earth!
