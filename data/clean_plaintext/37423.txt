When Spring, with scanty vest and maiden smile,
Leads on the youthful months and coming year,
Her tears of morning dew
Shall wet thy death-bed cold.

When jocund Summer with her honied breath
Sweet'ning the golden grain and blithsome gale,
Displays her sun-burnt face
Beneath the hat of straw;

When sober Autumn with lack-lustre eye
Shakes with a chiding blast the yellow leaf,
And hears the woodman's song,
And early sportsman's foot;

The Lily's hanging head, the Pansy pale,
(Poor Fancy's lowly followers) in meek
Attire, shall deck thy turf,
And withering lie with thee.

And naked Winter like a pilgrim grey
Of veriest rude aspect and joyless brow,
Calls for the carol wild
And trims the social fire;

Remembrance oft in pity's willing ear,
Shall toll at silent eve thy pensive knell,
And tell to after-days
Thy tale, thy luckless tale.
