O shepherds, how sweet are the bow'rs,
That rise on the verse of yon grove!
I wove there a garland of flow'rs,
To give to the nymph whom I love.

In native attractions array'd,
Till Nature decay she will reign;
Her praises be sung by each maid,
And ENVY will flout her in vain.

Her air has the magic of ease,
Her manners are artless and free;
Her voice is as soft as the breeze
That stirs the green leaf on the tree.

Long, long on the plains has she smil'd
With sweetness, untaught to deceive;
The light of her eye is as mild
As the sun-beam, when mellow'd at eve!

Oft on some soft bank she reposes,
To catch all the sweets of the gale;
Her garlands are made of the roses,
That bloom in the grove or the vale.

Her breast, that is always at ease,
The wild notes of Nature approves,
The streamlet that plains to the breeze,
And the music that comes from the groves.

Her songs to the Shepherds can give
A sweetness that softens the breast;
Can bid brightest images live
In the bosom that SORROW has prest.

This Damsel (the theme of my praise),
Who steals from the notice of Fame,
In vallies and woodlands oft strays&mdash;
SIMPLICITY there is her name.
