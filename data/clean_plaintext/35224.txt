Where towers the castle o'er the craggy rock,
Where with his UNA sits the red-cross knight,
There SPENSER walks Invention's faery path,
And views through circling mists the golden light.

Take we our stand amid the enchanted ground,
And see in arms the Paynim crew advance;
Indignant champions wave the vengeful steel,
In Virtue's cause they shake the threatening lance.

Behold the terrors of a Gothic night!
The giant sorcerer grasps his massy shield;
Imprison'd beauty shrieks in wild alarm,
And fiends infernal skim the flaming field.

It marks the genius of a barbarous age,
To see the wizard ride the foaming wave;
To see the spectre stride the blasted heath,
While forests crash, and storms destructive rave.

The language and the thoughts are ancient all,
Speaking the temper of unletter'd time,
When superstition held her dreary reign
Down from the Pole to Afric's burning clime.

Still o'er the nation hung romantic gloom,
Though Fancy call it England's brightest age;
For GLORIANA rul'd the warlike state,
While SIDNEY bled, and SHAKSPEARE rais'd the stage.
