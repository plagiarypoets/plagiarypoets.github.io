I.1.
From the morning grey and still
Fast the dews of night retire;
Wide along the heathy hill,
Burns a blazing Stream of fire;
Dark before the glittering gleam,
Shadows black of horsemen dance;
A steely light with starry beam,
Glimmers from the shivering lance:
Down the mountain, grand and slow,
Processioning in state they go:
In a bright cloud they close their firm array;
Throbbings of glory from the clarions sound;
Before them rolls the thunder of their way;
Before them darkness sweeps the shaking ground;
Heard ye the shout, that rent the air?
Saw ye the brandish'd spear, and flash of fiery glare?

I.2.
Like the wood's edge at deep of night
Striking back the heedless eye;
Gazing for the coming fight;
Dark and terrible we lie;
Silence dread and whispers low,
Panting expectation show;
With outstretch'd arms and streaming eyes
Thus the impassion'd father cries;
"Flower of hope, of fragrance wide,
Gem, that deck'd the green bank's swell,
No more upon thy painted pride,
My gazing tenderness will dwell.
Lightnings of Fury through my eyeballs dart
The worm of shame sleeps not, that twines around my heart."

I.3.
"Maiden of the shining eyes,
Cava dear and Cava fair,
Starting tears, and stealing sighs,
Would a father's pride declare;
Sweet the summer breeze, that blows
Lightly from the dancing rose;
Soft the silver glitter shed
From the violet's weeping head;
Gay the bird's new-feather'd wing.
Gay the fresh-born leaf of spring:
So sweet, so soft, so gay,
The meeken'd lustre of her vernal day;
When in the dance her graceful way she moved,
In speechless agonies of bliss I loved;
The flushes of her beauty sunk my eyes,
To thoughtless vacancy, and melting soft surprize."

II.1.
See the wind (the day is still)
The poplar's twinkling verdure shed;
Ah!  the judgment from the hill
Shows through the cloud his awful head!
Speedy death and present fear,
Guilty King, there vow to thee
Men, that never shed a tear,
Stormy or sullen as the sea;
Does the robber ever laugh?
Does the wolf's eye lose its fire?
These the bleeding life that quaff,
No human sympathies inspire:
Revenge, that shows what man can do,
Unfurl our banners thus, and terrify his view.

II.2.
Now the mountain's steep beneath,
The winter's flood has found its shores;
Now the north wind sweeps the heath
On our driving battle pours;
O'er the billows of the war,
Rodorigo shines afar;
The Northern Boar, with ruffian sway,
That bore the Eagle's spoil away;
Alarick's tremendous name
Burn his cheek with rage and shame;
Seven nights, asleep, awake,
Fast the bubbles rise and break;
Mighty warrior, mighty lord!
Will not greatness ease afford?
Round him teazing visions fly,
Suspense's shifting form and writhing agony.

II.3.
Seven nights and seven days
Will he gain a hero's praise&mdash;
Wide the doors enchanted throw
Blast his soul's desire and show!
King, those swarthy warriors see
Foes, that will thy victors be;
Read the characters of fate
They proclaim thy kingdom's date;
Urging is the unseen pow'r,
End of doubt and end of strife;
Soon will come the fatal hour,
Last of war, and last of life;
Vain the ardour, vain the toil,
Thine is not the joy of spoil;
Stony horror fills thine eyes;
Trumpets of Glory sound, and swell him till he dies.

III.1.
Live, Hope; prediction is but vain;
Mists gather to dispense again;
Does the thunder rend the skies?
In innoxious tears it dies&mdash;
Ah!  who is that, in deep despair,
Retiring with the lion's shame,
The fury of his glowing air,
A fire's expiring flash of flame;
By Fate's unmoving gaze downcast,
Weary, mad, forlorn, and last:
Flown are his bands; alone remain
Drops of the tempest's ceasing rain;
"Low the gasping Hero lies,"
(Hear the exulting Father's yell)
"Gambol," he screams, "ye fiends, before his eyes,
And greet his harrow'd ears with howls of Hell.

III.2.
"Is he gone, the Lord of Light,
The Sun, that spread his beams so wide?
Woe to Spain and endless night!
Shone he high in noon of pride?
No, it was with a glimmering flame,
The mockery of a winter's morn;
Where is the odour of his fame?
Gone with the fleeting flow'r, for ever, ever gone."

III.  3.
Julian, hear my dying breath;
(Prophetic is the voice of death;)
Think'st thou that belongs to thee,
The mighty of the mightiest decree?
He grants the infidel an hour
To punish Vice's lawless power;
Why pass those sages o'er the vale?
All hail, ye unborn nations, hail,
With beaming eyes of brighter rays!
Turn, instrument of Heaven, and gaze&mdash;
Ah!  famish'd in a dungeon deep,
At the bright day does Julian weep?
Dead do thy wife, thy children, lie?
Liv'd they with wishes but to die?
Blest is Roderick that's gone&mdash;
Forget not in thy woes this parting smile of scorn.
