"My Mother Cambridge, Nurse of choicest Wits!"
Thus sung the soothest Bard that ever sung.
But ah, unhappy Swain, ill thee befits
To raise thy rustic Pipe the Bards among.
O could I call the learned Mother mine!
Or mine the living Lyre that Colin strung!
How boldly then should rise th' immortal Line
Loud as the Notes that Angel-quires have rung!
And Ye, that boast the Privilege divine,
To make sweet Assignation with the Joys
That all by Camus' flow'ry Border shine,
Or bathe in his sweet Stream, remote from Noise;
'Till some new Lycon of your own shall rise,
O deign &mdash; O gently deign to look on mine!
