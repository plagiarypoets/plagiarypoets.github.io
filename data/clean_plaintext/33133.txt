In tunefull accents of a dolefull straine
Old Verlams fall thus Colin did complaine:
Verlam I was:  what boots it what I was
Sith now I am but weeds and wastefull grass?
But liv'd he now to see our townes each day
Made coats for sheep:  of them he thus might say,
Townes once we were:  what boots it what we were
Since nothing now but sheepes dung doth appeare?
Here's neyther greene of wastfull weeds or grasse,
Our wretched case is worse than Verlams was.
