Olympiaes matchlesse Son, whenas he knew
How many crowns his fathers sword had gaind,
With smoaking sighs, and deep-fetcht sobs did rew,
And his brave cheekes with scalding teares bedew,
Because that kingdomes now so few remain'd,
By his victorious Arme to bee obtain'd.

So (Learned Daniel) when as thou didst see,
That Spenser erst so far had spred his fame,
That hee was Monark deem'd of Poesie,
Thou didst (I gesse) ev'n burne with Jealousie,
Lest Lawrell were not left enough to frame,
A neast sufficient for thine endlesse Name.

But as that Pearle of Greece, soone after past
In wondrous conquests his renowned fire,
And others all, whose names by Fame are plac'te
In highest seate:  So hath thy Muse surpast
Spenser, and all that doe with hot desire,
To the Thunder-scorning Lawrel-crown aspire,

And as his Empires linked force was knowne,
When each of those that did his Kingdoms share,
The mighti'st Kings in might did match alone:
So of thy skill the greatnes thus is showne,
That each of those, great Poets deemed are,
Who may in no one kinde with thee compare.

One sharde out Greece, another Asia held,
And fertile Egypt to a third did fall,
But only Alexander all did wield.
So in soft pleasing Liricks some are skild,
In Tragicke some, some in Heroicall,
But thou alone art matchlesse in them all.
