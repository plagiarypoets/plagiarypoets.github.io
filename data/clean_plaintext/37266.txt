And one there was, amid that patriot band,
To whom that warrior note was wild and new
Of maiden shield, as yet his youthful hand
In war's array the cutlass never drew,
But with his ripening years the knowledge grew
Of all the wrongs of Stuart's hapless line,
And long with loyalty as firm as true,
His hope had pictur'd prospects more benign,
When for an injur'd prince he might in armor shine.

Till now, secluded on his mountains wild,
A life retir'd the youthful chieftain led,
Song or the chace his vacant hours beguil'd,
Or where the cliff rear'd high its rocky head,
Alone the tale of other times he read;
Where high achievements fix'd his steadfast soul,
Of chiefs heroic, who for freedom bled;
Of bugle's note and war-drum's swelling roll,
Till splendid dreams of power and fame defied control.

An only sister shar'd his social hours,
And when, returning from the chace at eve,
He sought the summit of his lofty towers,
For magic song would gentle Flora weave;
Such lay as sorrow might forget to grieve,
And melancholy's self delights to hear,
And oft his work would laboring peasant leave
When her sweet accents met his listening ear,
The witchery of her song in solitude to hear.

And early love had taught his breast to feel
The purest bliss that Heaven on earth bestows,
A flame so pure as never need conceal
The warmest wish that in the bosom glows;
Such love as jealousy nor changing knows;
From Ivor's boyish days the passion grew,
Nor doubt perplex'd, nor chilling coldness froze
And never hopeless sigh his bosom drew,
For Ivor was sincere, and Isabella true.

His was each joy a chieftain's heart could know
The generous temper and the liberal hand,
And native favor taught his heart to glow;
When round him throng'd in arms his mountain band
His smile their pleasure, and his look command;
Although he never yet had heard the yell
Of warfare sound; for in his native land
Till now had all been peace; along the dell,
Rung for the chace alone the deep-ton'd bugle's swell.

Thus pass'd his youthful day, and mild content
Still brighten'd every hour that onward came,
And if at times his tranquil brow was bent,
Or on his cheek turn'd indignation's flame,
It was when Flora's pensive song would frame
The tale of injur'd worth in other days;
Or when some war-worn veteran told the fame
Of Stuart's line; and then his steadfast gaze,
Deep fix'd, and stern, betray'd his furious passion's blaze.

And now his warrior fire, so long conceal'd,
Rag'd in his boiling bosom fierce and high;
And martial thought, and feeling, all reveal'd,
Low'rd on his brow and lightened in his eye:
There might discrimination's glance espy,
The sure presage of future high renown;
Resolv'd alike, when hours of peril nigh,
And sharpest dangers lowr'd in fearful frown,
Or hope's delusive hand his path with flowers had strown.

From hence farewell the pleasures of the chase,
For sterner object now engross'd his mind
Expected honors lure to glory's race,
And song, and feast, and love, are all resign'd,
His standard floats already on the wind;
In arms assemble fast, his clansman true,
Prompt at his call, their homes they leave behind
As fierce a band as ever sabre drew,
Who never yet, dismay'd, from foeman's forces flew.

And sad, when Ivor's parting hour drew nigh
Was every bosom destin'd to remain;
The tear was big in Isabella's eye,
And scarce could Flora's soul her grief restrain
At parting hour, alas!  how hard to rein
The swelling passion of the feeling breast;
When fond affection throbs in every vein,
And memory loves on former scenes to rest,
And lean upon the friend that former days has blest.
