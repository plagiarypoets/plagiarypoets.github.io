O thou, dread foe of honour, wealth, and fame,
Whose touch can quell the strong, the fierce can tame,
Relentless fear!  ah!  why did fate ordain
My trembling heart to own thy iron reign?
There are, thrice happy!  who disdain thy sway,
The merchant wand'ring o'er the wat'ry way;
The chief serene before th' assaulted wall;
The climbing statesman thoughtless of his fall;
All whom the love of wealth or pow'r inspires,
And all who burn with proud ambition's fires;
But peaceful bards thy constant presence know,
O thou of ev'ry glorious deed the foe!
Of thee the silent studious race complains,
And learning groans a captive in thy chains:
The secret wish when some fair object moves,
And cautious reason what we wish approves,
Thy gorgon front forbids to grasp the prize,
And seas are spread between, and mountains rise:
Thy magic arts a thousand phantoms raise,
And fancy'd depths and dangers fill our ways;
With smiling hope you wage eternal strife,
And envious snatch the cup of joy from life.
O leave, tremendous pow'r!  the blameless breast,
Of gilt alone, the tyrant and the guest;
Go, and thy train of sable horrors spread
Where murder meditates the future dead,
Where rapine watches for the gloom of night,
And lawless passion pants for other's right;
Go to the bad, but from the good receed,
No more the foe of ev'ry glorious deed.
