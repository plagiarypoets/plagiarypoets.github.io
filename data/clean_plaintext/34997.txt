What honors wait immortal Tasso's lyre!
What raptures crown Marino's flowing rhymes!
Remotest nations Godfrey's deeds admire,
And fair Adonis blooms thro' distant times.
See!  where the sun from eastern ocean climbs,
See!  where he dips his wheels in western main;
Ev'n there man's rugged breast, the muse sublimes,
And wins the soul from anguish and from pain;
The haughty tyrant, purpled o'er with crimes,
Reveres the muse, reveres the poet's strain:
The fam'd Nepenthe was harmonious song,
The streams of Pindus quench'd the thirst of woe;
O may the gods soft melody prolong,
And Helicon's deep springs for ever flow.
