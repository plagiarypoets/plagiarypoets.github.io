Edwards, to thee my grateful thanks are due;&mdash;
In numbers like thy own I fain would praise
Thy kind indulgence to my humble lays:&mdash;
By thee encourag'd and instructed too,
The lure of poesy I now pursue,
But dare not even hope my song to raise
Equal to thine, whose every verse conveys
Sense, strength, and harmony, and judgment true.
But that thy candour, &mdash; modest, &mdash; gentle bard,
I know is equal to thy power in song,
Or with a muse so weak, so young as mine,
I should not on presumptuous wings have dar'd
To imitate, with my unhallow'd tongue,
Numbers like Spenser's, Milton's, or like thine.
