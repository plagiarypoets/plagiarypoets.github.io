Ye shepherds, who yet are a stranger to love,
And think him a boy fond of joking,
Believe me, if ever his nature you prove,
You'll find him an urchin provoking.
Though yet with his smiles you have not been deceiv'd,
Take counsel from me and be wary,
Like you, his sad tricks, I had never believ'd,
Had I not been instructed by Mary.

I did not much like my own peace to destroy,
And laugh'd when I saw lovers languish;
I wish'd all the pleasure of love to enjoy,
But resolv'd to have none of the anguish.
Thus I kiss'd the sweet lips of each nymph of the plain,
Like a butterfly, fickle and airy;
Thus I scoff'd and I sneer'd at each languishing swain,
But alas!  I had not then seen Mary.

She was pure as the rose-bud, and scarcely fifteen,
When she came to our village a stranger,
I saw, and admir'd her angelical mien,
But never once thought of my danger,
All my former love-promises soon now I broke;
And it surely was no wild vagary,
Since so many fair nymphs I had courted in joke,
If I tried to do so with sweet Mary.

I courted her, just as I courted the rest,
But ah!  with a diff'rent sensation;
For when her sweet lips as a lover I press'd,
My heart beat in strange palpitation.
Her praises I sang &mdash; but I thought the song true,
And believe she must deal with a fairy:
For of all the fair mortals I ever yet knew,
There was none so enchanting as Mary.

I now am uneasy but when she is near,
And seldom am guilty of sleeping;
And tho' I disdain'd once the name of a tear,
Am constantly sighing and weeping:
Then, ye shepherds be wise; for to you is address'd,
This maxim, that never can vary,
To many sweet girls you may make love in jest,
But you must be sincere with a Mary.
