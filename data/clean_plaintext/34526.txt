A gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine,
Yclad in mightie armes and silver shield,
Wherein old dints of deepe woundes did remaine,
The cruell markes of many' a bloody field;
Yet armes till that time did he never wield:
His angry steede did chide his foming bitt,
As much disdayning to the curbe to yield:
Full jolly Knight he seem'd, and faire did sitt,
As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt.
