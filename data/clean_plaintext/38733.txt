What slender Youth, upon a rosy Bed
Perfum'd with liquid Odours, shall caress
Thee, Pyrrha, in some cool Retreat?
For whom bind'st thou thy golden Hair,

Neat in thy Cleanliness? &mdash; Alas!  how oft
Thy Faith and changeful Gods will he deplore:
Thy Ocean, swelling with dark Winds,
Shall fright his unaccustom'd Soul:

He, who too cred'lously enjoys thy Calm,
Who always thinks thee vacant, always lovely;
Vain Fool, a Stranger to the Gale
Fallacious! &mdash; Miserable they

To whom, untry'd, you shine! &mdash; But as for me,
The votive Tablet shews, that I have hung
My dripping Garments to the God,
Who rules the hoary Main.
