O where are they, whose all that earth could give
Beneath these senseless marbles disappeared?
Where even they, who taught these stones to grieve;
The hands that hew'd them, and the hearts that rear'd?
Such the poor bounds of all that's hoped or fear'd,
Within the griefs and smiles of this short day.
Here sunk the honour'd, vanish'd the endear'd:
This the last tribute love to love could pay,
An idle pageant pile, to graces pass'd away.

Why deck these sculptur'd trophies of the tomb?
Why, victims, garland thus the spoiler's fane?
Hope ye by these to avert oblivion's doom;
In grief ambitious, and in ashes vain?
Go, rather bid the sand the trace retain,
Of all that parted virtue felt and did!
Still powerless man revolts from ruin's reign:
And pride has gleam'd upon the coffin-lid,
And rear'd o'er mouldering dust the mountain pyramid.

Sink, mean memorials of what cannot die!
Be lowly as the relics ye o'erspread!
Nor lift your funeral forms so gorgeously,
To tell who slumbers in each narrow bed.
I would not honour thus the sainted dead;
Nor to each stranger's careless eye declare
My sacred griefs for joy and friendship fled.
O let me hide the names of those that were,
Deep in my stricken heart, and shrine them only there!
