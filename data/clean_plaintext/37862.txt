Within yon Cottage humbly wall'd with Clay,
And standing lonely by the Church-Yard Side,
A simple Rustic dwells, who knows no Guile,
No Friend to Luxury, or saucy Pride.

Artless his Language is, and plain his Dress,
And to his Shoulders graceful flows his Hair,
Comb'd smooth on Sundays, when his Duty calls
To strengthen with Amen the Parson's Prayer.

Loud in the Church his well-known Voice is heard,
Chaunting with pious Thought Old Sternhold's Strains,
Whilst many a Voice ill-tun'd in Chorus joins,
Gladd'ning his Heart, and paying well his Pains.

When the neat Village Maid, with modest Look,
With her lov'd Swain in Wedlock's Bands is join'd,
Gravely He stands, attentive to the Rite,
Nor strikes one wanton Thought across his Mind.

And when within the cold and dreary Grave,
His Rustic Neighbour or his Friend is laid,
Careful he sees each Duty well perform'd,
Nor fails to wish a Requiem to the Shade.

Nor is He Foe to Mirth, but oft at Eve,
When Youths and Maidens dance upon the Green,
Or round the Maypole, where at Season due,
Suspended high the flow'ry Garland's seen,

Then whilst with nimble Steps the Ground They beat,
Whilst merrily the Pipe and Tabor sound,
Pleas'd at the harmless Pastime, He stands by,
And sportive jests with all the Damsels round.

To Him the Tenets of the Schools unknown,
He by the Parson's Rules his Actions guides,
Those Rules he can deduce from Holy Writ,
And on his Skill therein himself He prides.

Frequent on Sundays, when the Sermon's done,
Along the Church-way Path He gravely walks,
And 'midst a Circle of unletter'd Swains,
Expounds the Sermon, and of Scripture talks.

Then home returning to the cleanly Hut,
(Which speaks the Housewife's neatness and her care)
There sings a Psalm, to pass the Sacred Eve,
Whilst round his Children silent sit to hear.
