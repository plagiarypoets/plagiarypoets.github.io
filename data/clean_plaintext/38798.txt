From Orchards of ample Extent,
Pomona's compell'd to depart;
And thus, as in Anguish she went,
The Goddess unburthen'd her Heart.

To flourish where Liberty reigns,
Was all my fond Wishes requir'd;
And here I agreed with the Swains,
To live, till their Freedom expir'd.

Of late ye have number'd my Trees,
And threaten'd to limit my Store:
I fear &mdash; from such Maxims as these,
I fear &mdash; that your Freedom's no more.

My Flight will be fatal to May:
For how can her Gardens be fine?
The Blossoms are doom'd to decay,
(The Blossoms, I mean, that were mine.)

Rich Autumn remembers me well:
My Fruitage was fair to behold!
My Pears! &mdash; how I ripen'd their Swell!
My Pippins! &mdash; were Pippins of Gold!

Let Ceres drudge on with her Ploughs!
She droops as she furrows the Soil;
A Nectar I shake from my Boughs,
A Nectar that softens my Toil.

When Bacchus began to repine,
With Patience I bore his Abuse;
He said that I plunder'd the Vine,
He said that I pilfer'd his Juice.

I know the proud Drunkard denies
That Trees of my Culture should grow:
But let not the Traitor advise;
He comes from the Climes of your Foe.

Alas!  in your Silence I read
The Sentence I'm doom'd to deplore:
'Tis plain, the great PAN had decreed,
My Orchard shall flourish no more.

The Goddess flew off in Despair;
As all her sweet Honours declin'd:
And PLENTY and PLEASURE declare,
They'll loiter no longer behind.
