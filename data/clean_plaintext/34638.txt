But, Mistress of each art to please,
Creative FANCY, what are these,
These Pageants of a trifler's Pen,
To what thy Pow'r effected then?
Familiar with the human mind,
As swift and subtle as the wind,
Which we all feel, yet no one knows
Or whence it comes, or where it goes,
FANCY at once in ev'ry part
Possess'd the Eye, the Head, the Heart,
And in a thousand forms array'd,
A thousand various gambols play'd.

Here, in a Face which might well ask
The Privilege to wear a mask
In spite of Law, and Justice teach
For public good t' excuse the breach,
With the furrow of a wrinkle
'Twixt Eyes, which could not shine but twinkle,
Like Centinels i' th' starry way,
Who wait for the return of day
Almost burnt out, and seem to keep
Their watch, like Soldiers, in their sleep,
Or like those lamps which, by the pow'r
Of Law, must burn from hour to hour,
(Else they, without redemption, fall
Under the terrors of that Hall,
Which, once notorious for a hop,
Is now become a Justice-shop)
Which are so manag'd, to go out
Just when the time comes round about,
Which yet thro' emulation strive
To keep their dying light alive,
And (not uncommon, as we find,
Amongst the children of mankind)
As they grow weaker, would seem stronger,
And burn a little, little longer;
FANCY, betwixt such eyes enshrin'd,
No brush to daub, no mill to grind,
Thrice wav'd her wand around, whose force
Chang'd in an instant Nature's course,
And, hardly credible in Rhime,
Not only stopp'd, but call'd back Time.
The Face, of eve'ry wrinckle clear'd,
Smooth as the floating stream appear'd,
Down the Neck ringlets spread their flame,
The Neck admiring whence they came;
On the Arch'd Brow the Graces play'd;
On the full Bosom Cupid laid;
Suns, from their proper orbits sent,
Became for Eyes a supplement;
Teeth, white as ever Teeth were seen,
Deliver'd from the hand of GREEN,
Started, in regular array,
Like Train-Bands on a grand Field-day,
Into the Gums, which would have fled,
But, wond'ring, turn'd from white to red,
Quite alter'd was the whole machine,
And Lady &mdash; &mdash; was fifteen.
