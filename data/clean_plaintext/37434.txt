O welcome to my soul congenial Pow'r!
Rough Winter hail!  I love thy hoary locks,
Thy tempest-breathing sighs,
The deluge of thy tears.

The forest shrinks beneath thine iron rod,
And the sad herds a faithless shelter seek,
Where the time-moulder'd tow'r,
Hangs tott'ring o'er the plain.

They raise their wishful eyes that seem t' upbraid
The ruthless season; while the raven cries,
From solitary tree,
With hoarse, and mournful note.

High Fiesole, of the bright mantle spoil'd
That once he wore with Flora's brede adorn'd,
In many a low'ring cloud,
Enwraps his sullen breast.

Nor longer Arno winds a stealing course
Thro' laughing meads, but on swift eddies borne,
His rude discordant tide
Rolls to the western deep.

This is my fav'rite hour of bliss serene,
To me more grateful, than the gaudy time,
When vocal Spring awakes
Her gaily-painted flowers.

Than when red Summer glares with sultry gaze
On the parch'd hills, or sallow Autumn throws
His golden treasure round,
And drains the purple vine.

Amidst the dreary Apennines I hear
The rumbling rocks increase the torrent's roar,
And the wide-ranging wolf
Howl on the mountain's side.

While Echo, starting from her icy bed,
Mimicks the uproar wild, and Fancy comes
In pilgrim robe array'd,
And waves her magic wand.

Lo!  at her call the fairy visions rise,
That calm the sense of woe, Remembrance brings
The mirrour of the past,
And sober Reason reigns.

Where are the jocund hours of wanton Mirth
That late beguil'd my youth, where are the friends
That join'd the choral lay,
When life's fair morn began?

Perchance they chase the fleeting pleasures still,
Nor cast one thought on him who listens here
To the wild storm, and woos
Grim midnight to his arms.

Then welcome to my soul congenial Power!
Rough Winter hail!  I love thy hoary locks,
They tempest-breathing sighs,
The deluge of thy tears.
