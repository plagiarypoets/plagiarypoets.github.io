JUNO.
Iris, on thee I do impose this taske,
To crosse proud Venus, and her purblind Lad,
Untill the mother, and her brat be mad,
And with each other, set them so at ods,
Till to their teeth they curse, and ban the Gods.

IRIS.
Goddes, the graunt consists alone in you,

JUNO.
Then mark the course which now you must pursue.
Within this ore-growne Forrest, there is found
A duskie Cave, thrust lowe into the ground:
So ugly darke, so dampie and steepe,
As for his life the sunne durst never peepe
Into the entrance:  which doth so afright
The very day, that halfe the world is night.
Where fennish fogges, and vapours do abound:
There Morpheus doth dwell within the ground,
No crowing Cocke, nor waking bell doth call,
Nor watchfull dogge disturbeth sleepe at all.
No found is heard in compasse of the hill,
But everything is quiet, whisht, and still.
Amid this Cave, upon the ground doth lie,
A hollow plancher, all of Ebonie
Cover'd with blacke, whereon the drowsie God,
Drowned in sleepe, continually doth nod:
Go Iris go, and my commaundment take,
And beate against the doores till sleepe awake,
Bid him from me, in vision to appeare,
Unto Ascanio the lieth slumbring heare.
And in that vision, to reveale the way,
How he may finde the faire Eurymine.

IRIS.
Madam, my service is at your command,

JUNO.
Dispatch it then, good Iris out of hand.
My Peacocks and my Charriot shall remaine,
About the shore, till thou returne againe.

Exit JUNO.

IRIS.
About the businesse now that I am sent,
To sleepes blacke Cave, I will incontinent:
And his darke cabine, boldly will I shake,
Untill the drowsie lumpish God awake:
And such a bounsing at his Cave Ile keepe,
That if pale death, seaz'd on the eyes of sleepe,
Ile rowse him up, that when he shall me heare,
Ile make his locks stand up on end with feare.
Be silent aire, whil'st Iris in her pride
Swifter then thought, upon the windes doth ride.
What Somnus what Somnus, Somnus.

Strikes.
Pauses a litle.

What wilt thou not awake?  art thou still so fast?
Nay then yfaith, Ile have an other cast.
What Somnus Somnus I say?

Strikes againe.

SOMNUS.
Who calles at this time of the day?
What a balling dost thou keepe?
A vengeance take thee, let me sleepe,

IRIS.
Up thou drowsie God, I say,
And come presently away,
Or I will beate upon this doore,
That after this, thou sleep'st no more.

SOMNUS.
Ile take a nap, and come annon.

IRIS.
Out you beast, you blocke, you stone:
Come, or at thy doore Ile thunder,
Til both heaven and hel do wonder, Somnus I say.

SOMNUS.
A vengeance split thy chaps asunder.

IRIS.
What Somnus?

Enter Somnus.

SOMNUS.
Iris I thought it should be thee.
How now mad wench, what wouldst with me?

IRIS.
From mightie Juno, Joves immortall wife,
Somnus I come:  to charge thee on thy life,
That thou unto this Gentleman appeere,
And in this place, thus as he lyeth heere,
Present his mistres to his inward eies,
In as true manner, as thou canst devise.

SOMNUS.
I would thou wert hangd for waking me.
Three sonnes I have, the eldest Morpheus hight:
He shewes of man, tha shape or sight.
The second Icelor, whose beheasts
Doth shewe the formes of birds and beasts.
Phantasor for the third, things lifeles hee:
Chuse which like thee of these three.

IRIS.
Morpheus:  if he in humane shape appeare.

SOMNUS.
Morpheus come forth in perfect likenes heere,
Of, how call ye the Gentlewoman?

IRIS.
Eurymine.

SOMNUS.
Of Eurymine:  and shewe this Gentleman,
What of his mistres is become.

Kneeling downe by Ascanio.
Enter Eurymine, to be supposed Morpheus.

MORPHEUS.
My deare Ascanio, in this vision see,
Eurymine doth thus appeare to thee:
As soone as sleepe hath left thy drowsie eies,
Follow the path that on thy right hand lies,
An aged Hermit thou by chaunce shalt find,
That there hath bene, time almost out of mind:
This holy man, this aged reverent Father,
There in the woods, doth rootes and simples gather:
His wrinckled browe, tells strengths past long ago:
His beard as white, as winters driven snow.
He shall discourse the troubles I have past,
And brings us both togither at the last.
Thus she presents her shadow to thy sight,
That would her person gladly if she might.

IRIS.
See how he catches to imbrace the shade.

MORPHEUS.
This vision fully doth his powers invade.
And when the heate shall but a litle slake:
Thou then shalt see him presently awake.

SOMNUS.
Hast thou ought else, that I may stand in sted?

IRIS.
No Somnus, no:  go back vnto thy bed:
Juno she shall reward thee for thy paine.

SOMNUS.
Then good night Iris, Ile to rest againe.

IRIS.
Morpheus farwell:  to Juno I will flie.

MORPHEUS.
And I to sleepe, as fast as I can hie.

Exeunt.
