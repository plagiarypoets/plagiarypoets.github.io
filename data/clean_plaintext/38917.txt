Dear little plant!  that here amid the gloom
And chill of winter puttest forth thy flowers,
Why waste on dreary scenes thy tender bloom,
Nor spread thy beauties in more genial blowers,
Where neither snows descend, nor tempest lowers?
But all is teeming with the sweets of May,
Where cheerful birds sing through the lengthening hours,
Making, with joyous notes, the scene more gay,
And offering up to God the homage of their lay.

Unlike the blossoms that in summer skies
Alone bud forth, and shed their fragrance round;
Though at thy birth the genial sun denies
His fostering care and warmth, thou still art found
Raising thy hardy stem above the ground.
Bleak is the prospect, and the teeming earth
Lies fast in Winter's icy fetters bound;
Hush'd is all Nature's melody and mirth,&mdash;
The frosts and snows of Heaven the handmaids of thy birth.

Yet do I prize thee &mdash; love thy buds to view,
On the drear face of Nature, opening blow,
More than the fragrant flowers of richer hue
That on the lap of rosy Summer glow.
Thou are like Friendship, that, in days of woe
And storms of fortune, comes to cheer their gloom;
The smile of gladness round life's winter throw,
All the bright promises of joy relume,
And cast o'er faded hopes a faint but sweet perfume.
