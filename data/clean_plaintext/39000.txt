'Twas here that Nature to the Poet's dream
Gave her enchanting forms, and bless'd his Muse
With scenes that MOLE his proud summit views
Enamour'd still; where MULLA'S wizard stream,
With hues unborrow'd of the Solar beam,
In frolic dance her glittering wave pursues;
Or where the cold and leafless rocks accuse
The ear, that heard unmov'd the giant-scream
Of many an ancient forest, crush'd and slain.
'Twas here that from Lismore, with state oppress'd,
The Fugitive took shelter:  it was here
That verse could soothe Ambition's goading pain,
With charm inspir'd: &mdash; Historian, blot the rest!
And spare the Muses a degrading tear!
