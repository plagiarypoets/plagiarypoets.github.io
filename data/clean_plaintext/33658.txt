What all Men wish'd, tho few cou'd hope to see,
We are now blest with, and oblig'd by Thee.
Thou from the Antient Learned Latine Store,
Giv'st us one Author, and we hope for more.
May They enjoy thy Thoughts &mdash; let not the Stage
The Idl'st Moment of thy Hours engage.
Each Year that Place some wond'rous Monster breeds
And the Wits Garden is o'er run with Weeds.
There Farce is Comedy, Bombast call'd Strong,
Soft words, with nothing in 'em, make a Song.
'Tis hard to say they steal them now adaies,
For sure the Ancients never wrote such Plays.
These scribling Insects have what they deserve,
Not Plenty, nor the Glory for to starve.
That Spencer knew, That Tasso felt before,
And Death found surly Ben exceeding poor.
Heaven turn the Omen from their Image here,
May he with Joy the well-plac'd Lawrel wear:
Great Virgil's happier fortune may he find,
And be our Ceasar, like Augustus, kind.

But let not this disturb Thy tuneful head,
Thou writ'st for thy Delight, and not for Bread.
Thou art not curst to write thy Verse with care,
But art above what other Poets fear.
What may we not expect from such a hand,
That has, with Books, Himself at free Command?
Thou Know'st in Youth what Age has sought in vain,
And bring'st forth Sons without a Mothers Pain:
So easy is thy Sense, Thy Verse so sweet,
Thy words so proper, and Thy Phrase so fit.
We read, and read again, and still admire
Whence came this Youth, and whence this wondrous fire.

Pardon this Rapture, Sir, but who can be
Cold and unmov'd, yet have his thoughts on Thee?
Thy goodness may My several faults forgive,
And by your help these wretched lines may live:
But if when view'd by your severer sight,
They seem unworthy to behold the Light;
Let 'em with speed in deserv'd flames be thrown,
They'll send no sighs, nor murmur out a groan,
But dying silently Your Justice own.
London, Feb. 6.
