Yet shall thy name be to all ages dear,
Beyond the sweetness of the balmy spring,
Or the soft notes that take the list'ning ear,
When in love's prime the nightingale doth sing;
The balm of woe, the rest from sorrowing,
The theme of pity, and the tongue of love,
Which never time shall to contemplation bring,
But in its sweetness still more dear shall prove;
That the pale moon, and the pure stars above
Shall stay their spheres with musick of thy praise,
The whiles the shepherds sing, as doth behove,
The triumph of Arcadia's blissful days,
And their shrill pipes to wood and fountain tell
The virtues of lamented Astrophel.
