The evening gun proclaims the close of day,
The nightly picquets to the posts retire;
And sternly challenge all who pass their way,
Nor quit their watchful stand till morning fire.

Save, where in yonder tent together met,
Upon the fatness of the land to dine,
Staff, Captain, Sub, their thirsty whistles wet,
And lose each care midst good roast beef and wine.

In front, the murder-breathing burnished arms,
Are now arranged in many glittering piles;
To rest, till trumpets sound the harsh alarms,
Or in the East the ruddy morning smiles.

But now the hours of deepest midnight reign;
Pale o'er each tent the moon her lustre throws;
No longer wine inspires, a jovial strain;
In balmy sleep each warrior finds repose.

In Morpheus' arms each British exile lies,
Unconscious of the ills of those who roam;
While ever busy waken'd Fancy flies,
And in idea tastes the joys of home.

But ah, no home nor haunts of youthful days,
Delight the wanderers on Indostan's shore;
They roam no longer o'er the broom-clad braes,
The converse of their friends enjoy no more.

No more the cheerful lark at early dawn,
Or heav'nly blackbird from her lonely bower,
Invite them forth, to tread the dewy lawn,
And taste the sweetness of the morning hour.

No more at winter's eve they now retire,
While rages wild the wintry storm abroad,
Where happy circles form around the fire;
Their native fond remembered first abode.

Perhaps, remote, unfriended here may lie,
Some bosoms formed with purest love to move;
Some, who entangled in the guardian-tie,
The faithful husband, and the friend would prove.
