MENALCAS.
Their gilded Heads Augustean Turrets raise,
And seem, like Rockets, as they rise to blaze!
No borrow'd Light to palefac'd Heav'n they owe:
Their Gates with Stars, their Streets with Comets glow.
With joyful Peals their stately Temples ring,
And in each Spire ten thousand Pleasures sing.
The warbling Sounds on hov'ring Pinions stretch,
But tire and languish e'er these Plains they reach.
"This solemn Night is spent in dutyous Mirth,
Blest Night, that gave great Galatea Birth!
No heavy Tax her free-born People grieves:
We pay her Tribute of the Joy she gives."
