Adieu to my flocks of white sheep,
And adieu to the vales where they fed
For though many the tears that I weep,
The devil a tear have they shed!

Ye lambs and ye lambkins adieu,
From the Leasowes your poet is off;
Farewell to each ram and each ewe,
For I've got a most damnable cough!

The devil may watch you for me,
I'm sure he'll be sick of the job!
For your Corydon's off, do you see,
Without ever sobbing a sob.
