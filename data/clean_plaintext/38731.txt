Young Chloe's as gay as the Spring,
But will change like an April Day;
As rich as the Summer &mdash; dear Thing,
And will frolic like Lambkins in MAY.

She's truly good-natur'd and meek,
If you catch her but when she's in Tune,
And if for her Virtues you seek,
They are bright as the Roses in JUNE.

The Flowers of JULY can't compare
To the Fragrance that hangs on her Lip,
Nor the Plenty of AUGUST declare
The Nectar that thence one might sip.

SEPTEMBER'S fine Fruits are more scarce
Than the Fruits of her elegant Mind;
The bright Beer of OCTOBER'S a Farce
To this the most bright of her Kind.

Yet NOVEMBER'S dull Fogs hang about her,
And she'll make the poor Devil remember,
Who finds he cannot live without her,
That her Heart is as cold as DECEMBER.
