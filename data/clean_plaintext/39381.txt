Ye nymphs, come attend to my song,
Regret your lov'd pastoral swain,
Accustom'd to join in the throng,
When chearful ye danc'd on the plain.

Reclin'd at the foot of a thorn,
By the side of a murm'ring stream,
The woes of a shepherd forlorn,
How often have they been his theme.

The swain that is faithful and true,
The nymph that is constant and kind,
Who love's disappointment ne'er knew,
As often his theme will you find.

Ye nymphs, that reside on the plain,
Attend to the voice of despair;
Come mourn for your pastoral swain,
And drop to his mem'ry a tear.
