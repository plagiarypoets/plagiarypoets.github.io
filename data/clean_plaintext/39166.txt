All languages she reads with learned eye,
The Roman, German, Hindostan and Greek;
Nor of her treasured languages is shy, 
But ever and anon will learned speak,
As naturally as injured pig does squeak;
And then she swells, and looks so mighty big,
(Like straining frog in some unhealthy creek,)
And shoots her leathern neck, and shakes her leg,
From every sitter by some eulogy to beg.

All little things she deems beneath her care,
And silent sits at dinner or at tea,
Filling with maiden grace an armed chair,
(Full maiden like, I ween, and chaste is she,
As maids at fifty-five are wont to be,)
Till roused by fell Contention's iron sway,
Adieu to social talk, in company;
Ten thousand asses would not raise a bray
So full of terror dread, and deaf'ning wild affray.

In silence oft', she heaves the deepened sigh,
For woman's fate, and man's relentless sway,
Lamenting such as wedlock's bands do tie;
Ah, that they ere had known a bridal day!
But rather deemed in privacy to stay,
And pass their days in independent ease,
Than every nobler sentient betray;
And for the paltry luxury, &mdash; to please,
Forego that maiden paradise, &mdash; to teaze.
