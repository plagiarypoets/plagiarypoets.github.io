O placid Ocean, scene of my delight!
How oft on thee I've gazed in night serene,
Charmed with the lustre of the evening light,
When twilight lingers in the space between
The sky and sea; or when the moon is seen
And her attendant stars that march on high,
Fit maids of honour for night's lovely queen;
&mdash;Then would my soul, great Lord, in rapture fly
To thee, and wish thy name to glorify.

But when the raging tempest roars on high,
And deaf'ning thunder strikes upon the ear;
When lightnings shoot impetuous through the sky,
And on the water's waste more bright appear;
When mountain waves their horrid breasts uprear,
And burst upon the shore; &mdash; O, who can tell
How much I do such scenes admire and fear?
Thou, Lord, art great in might, and Thou canst quell
This elemental strife, and all its gloom dispel.
