Hail!  rugged isle, whose sun-scorched hills are seen,
Heaving abrupt their heads of hoary grey,
With here and there a lively spot of green,
Like winter mingling with the bloom of May.
Yet to fair plains &mdash; to courts luxurious gay,
Did thy sage chief prefer those barren hills;
Full twenty years a wanderer did he stray,
Of life for thee despising all the ills,&mdash;
For thee the sage's blood oft flowed in crimson rills.

See yonder pile, torn by the tooth of time,
In moss-grown fragments scattered all around;
Oft did those walls to many a theme sublime&mdash;
To matchless eloquence and verse resound:
'Twas thence the sage philosopher, profound
In moral maxims, all his maxims drew;
Thence keen-eyed science look'd fair nature round,
In all her ways, with microscopic view;
There warriors learnt to fight and be victorious too.

Yon other ruin, crumbling into dust,
Where spotless chastity once found a home,
The pride of architecture rose, august,&mdash;
The arch &mdash; the column &mdash; and the gorgeous dome;
There pensive Penelope plied the loom
All day, and sad the tedious task unwove,
When sable night enveloped all in gloom,&mdash;
A blest example of unaltered love!
Not all the youth of Greece her steady faith could move.

Deep in the bosom of that woody glen,
Where echo whispers to the passing breeze
Of rosy spring, or, from her hollow den,
Roars to the blast that bends the groaning trees;
Where once the bath, for elegance and ease,
Surrounded with fair seats of swardy green,
Stately arose, the wondering stranger  sees
The lonely Arethusa, Naiad Queen,
Who, murmuring, seems to mourn the changes she has seen.

There heroes erst, when toil their nerves unstrung,
Imbibed fresh vigour from her cooling streams;&mdash;
There lovely beauties, sprightly, fair, and young,
Would oft repair to lave their snowy limbs;
Ah!  how degrading the mutation seems.
Now, there foul indolence, in female shape,
In squalid tatters basks in noontide beams;
And Sloth and Apathy their bodies scrape,
In form of men, with many a gaunt and gape.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Can this be Greece, the mighty and the brave?
Can this be Greece, renowned in arts and arms?
Can this be Greece, this pale dejected slave,
Whose torpid breast no ray divine informs?
Yes, this is Greece, divest of all her charms&mdash;
This drooping captive, manacled and bound;&mdash;
With heaving breast and supplicating arms,
Behold for aid, she wildly looks around,
But where, alas!  for Greece, is succour to be found!

Say, &mdash; ye who ponder on her abject state,
See what she is, and think of what she was,&mdash;
What over-powering evil could beget
Of this effect, this dire effect, the cause?
What levelled her proud cities and her laws?
Who tore the laurel from her marital brow?
Who bade fair Science and the Muses pause,
Leave bright Piera and high Pindus' brow,
To give in climes remote their sweetest strains to flow.

'Twas Luxury chief bane of social good,
Who steals his honour from the patriot's breast,
That parent of a foul and noxious brood
Of evils, worse than earthquakes, fire, and pest.
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

'Twas she bade cruelty infuriate burn
In the darksome breast of Tyranny;
'Twas she made man so base as not to scorn
Before a fellow man to bow the knee;
'Twas she made men, by nature born free,
Become the slaves of superstition wild;
And, led by Falsehood and Hypocrisy,
In labyrinths of error stray beguiled,
And be by Ignorance and Vice debased &mdash; defiled.

For time there was, when man in every land,
(That age flows sweetly in poetic lore&mdash;)
Warm from the impression of his Maker's hand,
Met brother man, &mdash; his equal and no more;
Till Luxury from his brow the impression tore&mdash;
Then Discord bade fell Rapine draw the sword;
Then Murder bathed his wheels in tepid gore,
And the fair pages of the world's record
Were blotted with the names of vassal, slave, and lord.

Where is the greatness of great Babylon?
And where is fled the haughty Roman's boast&mdash;
The polished Greece &mdash; the mighty Persian's throne?
All, all, beneath the hand of Luxury lost.&mdash;
Those realms never felt of age the frost,
Till they gave ear to Luxury's syren song&mdash;
Kingdoms attend!  you'll find unto your cost,
Whoever listens sinks the dead among&mdash;
So sings the muse &mdash; perhaps the muse is wrong.

Or does the unalterable voice of Fate
Thus speak the doom of empires as they rise&mdash;
"Rejoice awhile, for by a certain date
Your greatness withers, and your glory dies?"
Ah!  is it so?  and must the curious eyes
Of strangers yet behold Britannia low?
Must she, whose fame o'er earth and ocean flies,
To some new Goth  or some new Vandal bow?
And must her sons be doomed to slavery and woe.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

O, thou good spirit!  (for such sure thou art,)
That warms my breast with patriotic fire,
Be thine to influence every Briton's heart&mdash;
With love of Britain Briton still inspire.
Be thou around her still a wall of fire!
Shield her from foreign and domestic wrong!
Confound her foes &mdash; ev'n blast them in thine ire,
Bid faction cease; be mute Corruption's tongue,
And, till the wreck of time, her liberty prolong.
