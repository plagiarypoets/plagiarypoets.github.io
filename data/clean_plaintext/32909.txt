Up then, Melpomene!  the mournfulst Muse of nine,
Such cause of mourning never hadst afore,
Up grisly ghosts!  and up my ruefull rhime,
Matter of mirth now shalt thou have no more,
For dead she is that mirth thee made of yore, of yore,
Dydo my deare alas is dead,
Dydo my deare alas is dead,
Dead and lyeth wrapt in lead.
O heavy hearse,
Let streaming tears be poured out in store,
Let streaming tears be poured out in store,
Let streaming tears be poured out in store,
O careful verse,
O careful verse.

Why wayle we thus?  why weary we the gods with plaints,
Why wayle we thus?  why weary we the gods with plaints,
As if some evell were to hir betight?
Shee raigns a goddess, now emong the saints,
That whilome was the saint of shepperds light,
And is enstalled now in heavens height,
I see thee blessed soul I see,
Walke in Elyzian fields so free, so free,
O happy hearse,
Might I once come to thee (O that I might)
O joyfull verse, O joyfull verse.
