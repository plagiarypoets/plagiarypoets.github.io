RECITATIVE.
Faction hence!  thy torch resign!
Harmony shall rule to-day;
Sisters of the murky night,
Hence!  be gone!  avoid the light,
Some darker hour for business find,
Joy and transport rule to-day!

AIR.
In Albion, when Eliza liv'd,
Had then the lyrist of her praise,
To this more happy hour surviv'd,
What beauties now had grac'd his lays!
Now had he sung the chosen morn,
When a distinguish'd genial pow'r
Proclaim'd the glorious hour
The best of females should be born,
To glad the Prince, and fill his throne.

RECITATIVE.
Ye loyal Britons touch the lyre,
The lay let Charlotte's praise inspire,
To praise undue, let art belong;
'Tis Truth sublimes our annual song.

AIR.
Such be the verse to Charlotte giv'n,
The praise of Virtue swell to Heav'n,
Tell where the Royal Virtues shine,
That imitate the Grace divine.

CHORUS.
Sound, Britons, sound the festive song,
May heav'nly pow'rs her days prolong,
That late may rise the destin'd sun,
Shall call her to a brighter throne;
Where rob'd in radiances he shall move
'Mongst Britain's Guardians crown'd above!
