The Laboringe man whose paynfull lyms | dothe tille the fertile grounde,
To recompence his taken toyle | small profyte dothe redounde.
The Sheapeheard feedes his grazying flocke | with great excedynge care
Yet scarce a Lam and seldome that | falls out unto his share.
And what falls out for hym (good man) | that wrytes this paynfull booke
Nay gaynfull for the common wealthe | and suche as theron looke.
But only for to beat the bushe | whylst others catche the burde
To cracke the shell yet unto us | the carnell to affoorde.
To treade, and smoothe, the crooked pathe | and make a redye waye
For suche as do or after shall | lyke argument assaye
What payns to seek olde wrytten bookes | what charge to buye the most
What care to kepe old monuments | that els had bene but lost.
But last of all what recompence | remaynes for this and more
But only with his handy worke | for to mayntayn his stoore
Lament, Lament, good aged man | Augustus he is gone
Maecoenas dead and layd in grave | and patrons there be none.
Thy age at last requyreth east | thy studye quyet rest,
Unles the gayns wold quyte the payns | to leave I hold it best
Let Caesar wryte his dreadfull warrs | let noble men alone
To tell there predecessors actes | that now are dead and gone
Let Cytezyns them selves declare |what deds there mayors have done
What Benefactors they have had | what honor they have wonn
And though your self a Cytezyn | regard there lastyng fame
Yet reason is they should reward | or recompense the same.
