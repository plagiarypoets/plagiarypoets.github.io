Yon little brook that murmurs on its way
O'er shining pebbles and through clustered flowers,
Hath been to me the source of many a lay,
Warbled at times amid its fairy bowers;
Appealing to my spirit with a tone
Half like the tone of Joy, and half like Sorrow's own!

How sweetly droops yon willow on its side,
Watching its moveless branches in the glass!
How bright, how beauteously, the waters glide,
Winning my heart to bless them as they pass!
And I will bless you, oh ye waters clear!
Of many a smile the source, and many a sweeter tear.

Oh!  not unlike the current of your tide,
In this green valley slips my life away;
To lofty name and glory unallied,
Shunn'd by the rich, and slighted by the gay.
Yet, by some faithful and unchanging friend,
Watch'd with an eye of love, &mdash; advancing to its end!
