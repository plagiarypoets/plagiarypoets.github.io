It is a sunny vision &mdash; a deep dream,
Too full of beauty for the heart to dwell,
Unpain'd, upon the dazzling rays that stream
Around the Bard's creations:  Music's swell
Voluptuous on the ear &mdash; the camel-bell
Borne softly on the distance &mdash; banners bright
Instinct with gems:  that Angel ere he fell,
And starry Eblis, in their mingled might,
Deluge each weary pulse with too intense delight.

We turn away, with dim delirious sense,
From that so fervid blaze; and seek repose
From Eastern splendour and magnificence,&mdash;
From gorgeous palaces, and clouds of rose,
Sceptres and thrones and diamond-crested brows,
Pluming our spirits' pinions at the page,
Where sweet Floranthe warbles forth her woes,
In strains, of power each turbulent thought to 'suage,
And bid the passions cease their fierce wild war to wage.

Surpassing Lyrist!  from thy powerful hand
The thunders and keen lightnings of the Muse
Speed forth in glorious might; &mdash; thou canst command
The noon-tide burst of Poesy; yet infuse
Its twilight calms and bloom-refreshing dews,
Amid thy deep conceptions, &mdash; and canst braid
Woofs rich and bright, with variegated hues,
As those on an Arabian heaven display'd,
Ere day's last rainbow-beams have vanished into shade.
