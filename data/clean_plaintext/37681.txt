Here Rosamond, (ah!  such is Beauty's doom)
Tho' once she shone with more than angel's face,
Laid low within the dusky Charnel's gloom,
With her sweet name the rugged wall doth grace;

Loos'd by the wintry wind and driving rain,
Here stones disjointed seem to hang in air;
Fall'n is the gate, which ne'er shall close again,
No more the prison of the cloister'd Fair.

Deep is the darksome valley's lone retreat,
Where once to peace and their own God resign'd,
Religious virgin handmaids chose their seat,
Which well might awe the serious pious mind.

Here, in the late slow hours of waining night,
Full oft from far the traveller doth spy
The secret taper's levell'd stream of light,
Steal through the crevic'd windows arch'd on high.

The midnight bell, at whose accustom'd sound,
With pine and fasting pale, with watchings worn,
Each maiden trac'd the lonely cloysters round,
Oft wak'd the sleeping lark before 'twas morn.

Fled are those days upon the wing of time:
Now here and there with damp and moss o'ergrown,
Moulders the fretted aile and roof sublime,
The massy buttress and the pile o'erthrown.

The heifer plucks the ivy from the wall:
Fall'n Godstow, is the glory of they dome!
Weep, stranger, as thou passest, weep its fall,
And strew a flow'r on Rosamonda's tomb.
