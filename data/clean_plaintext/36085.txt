Ye varying Tomes from ponderous folios down
To duodecimos, so neat and small,
That with all wisdom and all virtue crown
The manly student &mdash; how I love you all!
And love ye, but the more, as I am thrall!
'Tis yours to give, ineffable delight,
That to a chosen few can only fall
In this estate of darkness mix'd with light
This wildering day &mdash; dream and this human night,
Where sorrow wide expands her tainted wings,
And sheds upon mankind her baneful blight,
As thro' the world exultantly she springs.
Few tho' the hours to you that I can give,
Trophies of mind, I'll love you while I live.
