In thought I saw the palace domes of Tyre;
The gorgeous treasures of her merchandize;
All her proud people in their brave attire,
Thronging her streets for sports, or sacrifice.
I saw her precious stones and spiceries;
The singing girl with flower-wreathed instrument;
And slaves whose beauty asked a monarch's price.
Forth from all lands all nations to her went,
And kings to her on embassy were sent.
I saw, with gilded prow and silken sail,
Her ships that of the sea had government.
Oh gallant ships!  'gainst you what might prevail!
She stood upon her rock, and in her pride
Of strength and beauty waste and woe defied.

I looked again &mdash; I saw a lonely shore,
A rock amid the waters, and a waste
Of trackless sand: &mdash; I heard the bleak seas roar,
And winds that rose and fell with gusty haste.
There was one scathed tree, by storm defaced,
Round which the sea-birds wheeled, with screaming cry.
Ere long, came on a traveller slowly paced;
Now east, then west, he turned, with curious eye,
Like one perplexed with an uncertainty.
Awhile he looked upon the sea, and then
Upon a book, as if it might supply
The thing he lacked: &mdash; he read, and gazed again;
Yet, as if unbelief so on him wrought,
He might not deem this shore the shore he sought.

Again, I saw him come: &mdash; 'twas eventide;&mdash;
The sun shone on the rock amid the sea;
The winds were hushed, the quiet billows sighed
With a low swell; &mdash; the birds winged silently
Their evening flight around the scathed tree:
The fisher safely put into the bay,
And pushed his boat ashore; &mdash; then gathered he
His nets, and hastening up the rocky way,
Spread them to catch the sun's warm evening ray.
I saw that stranger's eye gaze on the scene;
"And this was Tyre!"  said he, "how has Decay
Within her palaces a despot been.
Ruin and silence in her courts are met,
And on her city rock the fisher spreads his net."
