Daughter of Exercise!  at whose command
Mirth spreads a smile upon the cheek of Care:
At whose re-kindling breath
Sickness looks up, and lives:
Say!  where (for much thy haunts I long to woo)
Shall I thy joy-infusing presence hail,
Amidst what sylvan scenes,
Or unfrequented plains?
Say!  when the roseate finger of the morn
Points out the glories of her short-liv'd reign
Shall I thy steps pursue,
Climbing the mountain's side,
From whose tall brow, in eminence superb,
Fair Nature views her fruitful vales below,
While Phoebus darts around
His oriental eye?
Or shall I trace thy vestige o'er the heath,
Where in derision of the Florists aid,
Shoots up, untaught by art,
The voluntary flow'r?
For well, 'tis known, that oft upon the heath
In contemplation, devious art thou seen,
Or panting up the steep
Of an un-imprinted hill.
Or, when cool evening in her floating vest
Sweeps o'er the lawns, diffusing shadowy pomp,
And bids the sun recline
On Amphitrite's breast,
I will attend thee to the solemn grove,
Where Love stands registered on ev'ry tree,
Where the Rook rocks his young,
And Echo learns to caw.
Or standing on the margent of the stream,
I will survey thee on the passive wave,
Then press the liquid bed
To meet thy Naiad kiss.
O tell me, nymph, thy chosen residence,
Be it on mountain top, or forest wild,
And I will consecrate
A temple to thee there.
