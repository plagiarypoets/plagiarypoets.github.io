With classic grace, let the historic page
Unfold her annals; as the studious mind
Explores the rudiments of human-kind:
Their states, and rising arts, or patriots' noble rage.
Then converse with the mighty dead, who rais'd
So high the GRECIAN, and the ROMAN name;
Who greatly struggling nurs'd the virt'ous flame,
Which bless'd the grateful state, and through the nations blaz'd.
Or raptur'd in the Muses shades,
I hear the nine harmonious maids,
Awake bold HOMER'S sounding lyre;
Or courtly MARO'S temper'd fire;
Or, ALBION, what thy bards rehearse
In buskin'd state, or daring verse:
The magic strains, with wondrous pow'r,
Attune the soul, and charm the list'ning midnight hour.

Hail CHAUCER!  rev'rend Seer, with comic song,
And antique lyre, to charm in simpler days.
Hail SPENCER!  skill'd to train, 'midst flow'ry ways
Of fairy ground, our youth, led by inchantment strong.
Sweet SHAKESPEAR!  child of Fancy!  whom thy Nine
Inspire, and give to drink the sacred spring;
With lofty MILTON hail!  whose angel-wing,
And Muse of Fire, nor Earth, nor Hell, nor Heav'n itself confine.
DRYDEN!  who paints in living page
TIMOTHEUS' art, and TURNUS' rage:
And POPE!  who leads the tuneful throng;
Great judge, and master of the song,
With plaintive YOUNG and THOMSON, hail!
Instructive bard!  whose silvan tale,
With Doric charm, and fancy bright,
Inspires my trembling wings, to trace thy nobler flight.

Thrice happy, who thus wisely cheer the gloom
Of pining nature, while delighted high,
They court the Muses' shrine, and pleas'd descry
Fair Truth, all heav'nly bright, their darkness to illume. . . .
