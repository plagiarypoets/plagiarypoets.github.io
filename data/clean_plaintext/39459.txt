Historians from Norway their Wonders have told,
Of Oceans converted to Crystal by Cold;
Where Hailstones the shiv'ring Inhabitants sneeze,
And the Moment they're utter'd, whole Sentences freeze.

But Cold more intense in my Swain I can boast;
Not frigid is he, but an absolute Frost:
He makes the chill Blood in each Artery halt,
Till I, like Lot's Wife, am a Pillar of Salt.

Statira this Praise on her Hero bestow'd,
That he curl'd like a Vine, and he touch'd like a God;
But in Touchings or Curlings of Walter are shewn,
The Cramp-fish and Cucumber blended in one.

Old Spenser his Readers inform'd long ago,
Of a certain false Florimel made out of Snow&mdash;
Were Florimel here, and would take my Advice,
She'd find, in my Walter, a Husband of Ice.

Whoe'er to the World, as his Wife, shall go forth,
Will, at best undertake, but a Voyage to the North;
For his Eyes seem the Stars (or else Sailors impose)
Which have lighted whole Vessels so oft to be froze.

Whenever he sues for my Favour and Grace,
His Breath, like a Snow-ball, flies hard in my Face.
The Tea-kettle never will boil when he's by,
And stiff in their Glasses my Goldfishes die.

Of such like petrific Materials we make
The King who sticks fast to the frost of a Cake,
Between them this Difference alone can be felt,
That Walter's infusible, Sugar will melt.

Thus, though (from last Sessions unable to 'scape)
A Bailiff must swing for committing a Rape,
My Walter (in Spite of his Case) as a Lover,
I'd venture to travel with all the World over.
