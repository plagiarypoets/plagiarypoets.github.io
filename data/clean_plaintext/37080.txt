Were I, Paul Jones, dear maid, "the king of sea,"
I find such merit in thy virgin song,
A coral crown with bays I'd give to thee,
A car which on the waves should smoothly glide along:
The Nereides all about thy side should wait,
And gladly sing in triumph of thy state
"Vivat, vivat, the happy virigin muse!
Of liberty the friend, who tyrant power pursues!"

Or, happier lot!  were fair Columbia free
From British tyranny &mdash; and youth still mine,
I'd tell a tender tale to one like thee
With artless looks and breast as pure as thine.
If she approved my flame, distrust apart,
Like faithful turtles, we'd have but one heart:
Together then we'd tune the silver lyre,
As love or sacred freedom should our lays inspire.

But since, alas!  the rage of war prevails,
And cruel Britons desolate our land,
For freedom still I spread my willing sails,
My unsheath'd sword my injured country shall command.
Go on, bright maid!  the muses all attend
Genius like thine, and wish to be its friend.
Trust not, although conveyed through this poor shift,
My New-Year's-thoughts are grateful for thy gift.
