Where are the stately towers of Solyma?
Her gorgeous palaces, her thronging gates?
Where are her solemn feasts,
Her hallow'd temple now?

A spacious hollow is Solyma,
So full of people once, so lov'd of Heav'n;
The ways of Zion mourn,
Her gates are desolate.

The Lord hath trodden down her mighty men,
The Lord hath swallow'd up her palaces,
And bound around her neck
Her heavy yoke of sins.

Yet not unwarn'd the pleasant city fell;
Not sudden came the judgments of her God;
Long suff'ring was her God,
Long suff'ring, slow to wrath.

The Prophet's voice was heard amid her streets,
"Wash ye, and make you clean, and put away
The evil of your deeds;
Repent, and be forgiven!

"Bring no more vain oblations, saith the Lord;
The solemn meeting is a mockery;
Who hath requir'd this,
That ye should tread my Courts?

"Behold ye fast for strife, ye fast for war,
To smite with the strong arm of ambition.
Ye shall not fast like this,
To make your voice be heard.

"Is it a fast like this that I have chosen?
In sackcloth to be rob'd, and bow the head,
Ev'n as the bull-rush bows
Before the passing wind?

"This is the fast that I the Lord have chosen:
To feed the hungry, and to clothe the poor;
And that from thine own flesh
Thou do not hide thyself:

"To loose the heavy bands of wickedness,
To break all yokes, to set th' oppressed free:
This is the fast that I
The Lord thy God have chosen."

The Prophet's voice was heard in Solyma;
She heeded not the warning voice of Heav'n.
Where are her stately tow'rs,
Her princely dwellings now?
