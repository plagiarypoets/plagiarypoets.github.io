I come not, Death!  with vain, untimely fears,
Urn-shadowing cypress and the midnight dew,
To offer at thy shrine,
And deprecate thy wrath.
I bring not Fear, in Frenzy's robe array'd,
To own the ruling terrors of thy name,
And feed thy cruel pride,
With murmurs of despair.
For what art thou, O Death!  that reason's eye
Should shun the menace of thy threat'ning might;
Or turn upon thy form
The gaze of wild dismay?
Or why should terror arm thy uprais'd hand
With shafts of anger, and the murderer's rage;
And throw around thy brows
The lightning's livid fires?
Were life the limit of the Spirit's course,
The grave the barrier of her brief career,
Beyond whose loathsome bourn
No star of being gleam'd:
Had Nature to the winds of Heav'n proclaim'd
No bright reversion that awaits the soul,
When bursting from her chains,
She seeks her kindred skies:
Did not Religion from thy masked brow
Pluck the vain shadow of a mimic crown,
And lift the veiling cowl,
To shew a Seraph's smile:
Then, Death, I'd hail thee monarch!  and thy shrine
Should hear my vows, and bear my proffer'd bribes,
To win the light of Heav'n
One moment to my gaze!
I'd clasp the breast that loves me, and would swear
In madness, that thy unrelenting hand
Never, with ruthless might,
Should rend Affection's bands!
But since Religion's clear, prevailing voice,
With words of mercy, tells the trembling soul
That Heav'n has Death ordain'd
It's minister of love!
Bring flow'rs, bring essence from the living rose,
And strew around the sickly couch of Death,
From whence the Spirit bounds
On her immortal wings.
Be this thy triumph and thy glorious boast,
Angel of Death!  that at thine awful end
The shadowing veil is rent,
Time's fleeting structure falls.
The seraph vision of the glowing mind,
The hope of Genius, and the soul's desire,
Start into light and form,
Freed by thy transient pow'r!
