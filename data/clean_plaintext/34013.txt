Ae time as Cupy sweet tuith'd Fairy
A hive, owr ventersome wad herry;
A Bee was nettled at the wrang,
And gave his hand a dispert stang;
It stoundit sare, and sare it swell'd,
He puft and stampt and flang and yell'd;
Then way full drive to Mammy scowr't,
And held her't up, to blow't and cur't,
Wondren sae feckless &mdash; like a varment
Cud have sae fearfu' mikle harmin't.
She smurk'd &mdash; and pra' tha' says his mudder,
Is not lile Cupy seck anudder?
Just seck anudder varment's he;
A feckless-like &mdash; but fearfu' Bee&mdash;.
