I had a vision! &mdash; 'Twas an Indian vale,
Whose sides were all with rosy thickets crown'd,
That never felt the biting winter gale;&mdash;
And soon was heard a most delicious sound;
And to its music danc'd a nymph embrown'd,
Leading a lion in a silken twine,
That with his yellow mane would sweep the ground,
Then on his rider fawn &mdash; a boy divine!
While on his foaming lips a nymph shower'd purple wine.
