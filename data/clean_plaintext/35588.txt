Loud howl'd the blast of Winter o'er the heath,
Shedding keen rigours from its frosty wing;
And oft the solemn monitor of death
For some departed soul was heard to ring.
Stern season!  still 'tis thy reproach to bring
Increase of suff'ring to the sons of Pain;
To bid the joints acuter tortures wring,
And fiercer fervours still thy throbbing vein.
But, in the triumphs of thy rig'rous reign,
Lately atchiev'd around our weeping shore,
One with peculiar grief we saw thee gain&mdash;
SHARMAN &mdash; lamented SHARMAN &mdash; is no more!
The friend of Science &mdash; to his country dear&mdash;
A patriot prov'd &mdash; benevolent &mdash; sincere.
