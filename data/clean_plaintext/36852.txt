Scotland!  thy bosom nursed me &mdash; ravines dark
And shapeless rocks first met my youthful view,
And, from a child, I deemed it joy to mark
The majesty of nature as she drew
Each wild and varied scene, and changed her hue
With every changing season; but the wind
Of adverse fortune sharp and keenly blew
On my defenceless head, &mdash; for this I find
My way to climes remote, and leave thy glens behind.

Still, Scotland!  still I love thee, and my love
Burns brighter as my footsteps leave thy shore&mdash;
Thy towering hills may rear their heads above
The tempests which surround them, bleak and hoar
Piercing the clear blue sky, though ocean roar
And lash around their bases; but for me
I may behold thy rugged wilds no more,
Except in slumbers, when I dream of thee
In a far distant land, beyond the heaving sea.

I could have wished to linger, and contend
With harsh Misfortune, rather than to stray
To foreign realms &mdash; I could have wished to spend
My years where dwelt my fathers, and then lay
My bones beside their ashes, to decay
And rot with kindred dust, &mdash; while o'er my urn
Some aged friend might bend with tresses grey,
And, for the love I bore him, weep and mourn;
But fate forbids &mdash; I go, and never may return.

Though India's sky be milder &mdash; though the breeze
Satiate the senses, breathing with perfume&mdash;
Though the fruits drop with richness from the trees,
And variegated flowers successive bloom
In endless beauty, shall my soul resume
Far from my native soil its wonted tone?
No, sunk in speechless grief and hid in gloom,
Remember scenes of pleasure past and gone,
I'll lay me down, and die forgotten and unknown.
