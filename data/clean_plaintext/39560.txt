There up to heav'n a mass of rock was pil'd,
Which seem'd to mingle with the midnight sky;
Of rude access it was, and prospect wild,
And rear'd its proud ambitious head so high
As almost left behind the aching eye.&mdash;
Deck'd was the scene with beauties all its own,
Whose pow'rful charms each critic glance defy;
And on its topmost height, the regal throne
Of this romantic realm, stood Avon's Bard alone.

Alone he stood &mdash; for there was none but he
On such a fearful precipice could stand;
Careless he stood, from fear and danger free,
And wav'd with ease that more than magic wand,
Whose pond'rous weight would numb each other hand;
For who like him could fairy chaplets twine,
Could paint with living hues the airy band
Of shapes infernal and of forms divine,
Or dive so wond'rous deep in Fancy's golden mine?

Reluctant rising from their nether skies,
A troop of griesly ghosts before him stood,
With iron teeth and staring stony eyes,
Demons and fiends, and all the hellish brood
Which Fancy figures in her trembling mood;
Around his head those elves and spirits flew,
Who taste on earth of heav'n's ambrosial food,
Who suck with bees the cowslip's honey due,
And steal, to make them coats, the rainbow's brilliant hue.

There on her car sate Mab the fairy queen,
And dreams of various hue around her flung;
Her coachman, merry Puck, array'd in green,
Before her on the nut-built chariot hung,
And all his knavish tricks and frolics sung.
There was the witch's child, who ne'er unclos'd
His brutal lips but forth a curse there sprung;
And Ariel quaint, of other mold compos'd,
Who trode the winter wind, and in the gale repos'd.
