The strain, a shepherd-boy hath sung erewhile,
All by the side of some romantic hill,
(His flock at feed,) perchance, may gain a smile,
And thy soft breast with simple nature thrill;
Unmeet for him, to seize the golden quill
Of schoolman sage.  He seeks more flowery ways,
Where Joy and Peace their balmy sweets distill.
Thou didst the Shepherd from oblivion raise,
And if he dares to charm, be thine, not his, the praise!
