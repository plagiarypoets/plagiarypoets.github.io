Where aged CHAM in fam'd Meanders flows,
His early Youth a soft Retirement chose,
To rest beneath the venerable Shade,
Where SPENCER sung, and COWLEY's Muse was laid.
Propitious Nature had prepar'd before,
A mind tenacious of the learned Store;
The flowing Springs of Knowledge to receive,
And take Impression fast as Art could give.

Auspicious CHAM!  not all thy boasted Race
Of tuneful Youths, that celebrate thy Praise;
That in the various Spheres of Learning shine,
Belov'd by Phoebus and the sacred Nine;
With nobler Wreaths did e'er thy Temples crown,
Or add, like him, to thy diffus'd Renown. . . .
