Come, Heav'n-born maid!  with aspect sweet,
Fair Virtue!  from thy aweful seat,
From that steep mountain, whence descends
A shining rill to cheer thy friends;
While, through the sultry wilds of life,
Victorious over factious strife,
Thou guid'st them, with indulgent hand,
Securely to thy promis'd land.
Come, to my ravish'd sight confest,
In all thy native radiance drest,
And, warbling thy immortal strain,
Lead sprightly on thy fav'rite train,
Content, and Peace, and Wisdom meek,
And Health, the nymph with rosy cheek.

But if no mortal eye must know
Unveil'd that beauty's vivid glow,
With which, near Heav'n's imperial throne,
Through endless ages thou hast shone;
O!  come, array'd, celestial fair!
In my lov'd Delia's shape and air;
And while deluded thus I gaze,
Through weary life's perplexing maze,
O'er dreary tracts where Envy reigns,
O'er Hate's inhospitable plains,
In Siren Pleasure's faithless way,
Where oft thy heedless vot'ries stray,
With thy serene, thy steady light,
Conduct my wandering footsteps right.
Or rather let the soft deceit
Soon disappear, however sweet;
Soon let my Delia's real voice
Bid all my list'ning soul rejoice,
With accents mild my doubts remove,
And blushing own a mutual love.
Then, Virtue!  then thy pow'r exert,
Pour all thy influence on my heart,
From each debasing passion free,
And make it worthy her and thee.
