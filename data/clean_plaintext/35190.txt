Dear POWER OF VERSE!  thy hand with forceful art
Holds Nature's golden key that opes the heart;
There in that magic circle bids to move
The fiends of Passion, or the forms of Love;
To finer sentiment can wake the Mind,
And touch it's shadowy forms with tints more kind.
Thy SOCIAL POWER, it's honours now no more,
Each child of Fancy shall in vain deplore.
As Faction's vipers hiss within thy bowers,
From their cold fingers fall the dewy flowers:
The Dorian flute, the lyre Aeolian, cease;
Nor Dorian flute, nor lyre Aeolian, please!
E'en SHAKESPEARE'S genius, SPENSER'S fancy, fail;
While Folly bids her WOLCOT'S scandal hail.
'Tis She that gives his malice wings to fly&mdash;
Nursing in natal dirt the infant Lie,
Till grown more bold it flaunts about the town,
The dirty Prostitute of half-a-crown. . . .

Then DULNESS triumph'd in her barbarous rage,
And smil'd indignant on the Poet's page.
No more the secret springs that lift the soul
Yield to his touch, and feel his soft controul.
The rust of Avarice all the heart imprest,
Spoil'd its quick pulse, and canker'd all the breast.
Now ceas'd the musick of the Poet's lyre,
The genial rapture flowing from his wire:
Now light the Muse's polish'd toils they deem;
Sad SPENSER languish'd by cold MULLA'S stream,
Felt Pride's dark frown, illiberal Grandeur's spurn,
And all his injur'd feelings vainly burn.
For BURLEIGH had no heart; such he who rose
The Savage Chieftain of fair Learning's foes.
And as the volumes in his flames expire,
Shakes the last brand, and blows th'exhausted fire,
To Infamy the Muse consigns his name,
And stirs his ashes till they stink to fame.
