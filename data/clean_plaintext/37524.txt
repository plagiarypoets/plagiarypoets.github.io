ACT THE FIRST.
RECITATIVE.
'Twas at the royal show, and grand display
Of all the navy which at Portsmouth lay;
Aloft in laughing state,
B&mdash;'s monarch sat,
And look'd serenely gay.
Goldstick, and other Peers were plac'd around,
Their hair in bags or silken ribbons bound:
So should, ye fair, our men of arms be crown'd!
Charlotte smil'd sweetly at his side,
Yet inwardly, alas!  she sigh'd
At G&mdash;'s folly, and at Twitcher's pride.

AIR.
Happy, happy, happy pair,
How they rejoice!
How they rejoice!
To see the weather grown so fair!
CHORUS, AND THE SAME.

RECITATIVE.
Then Sandwich plac'd on high,
Amid the tuneful band;
Struck the loud kettle-drum with mighty hand;
The deaf'ning notes ascend the sky,
And sound along the strand.

RECITATIVE.
From Fred'rick began the strain,
Who left Germania's bleak domain
For England &mdash; such the pow'r of Stuart's reign!
Augusta then his Highness woo'd,
Got children, as all Princes shou'd,
When he to Sax Gotha press'd,
And while he sought her snowy breast:
Then round her waist his arms he spread,
And stamp'd an image of himself &mdash; a Prince without a head.

CHORUS.
The list'ning tars admire the lofty sound,
A Prince without a head &mdash; they shout around;
A Prince without a head &mdash; the vaulted skies rebound.

AIR.
Not us'd to hear
Such truth's sincere,
At first he shrinks
Before he thinks,
That tars must have their jeer.

RECITATIVE.
The praise of Pinchy then the great musician sung,
Of Pinchy, in invention ever young,
The jolly dog in triumph comes,
(Sandwich beats the kettle drums)
Flush'd with a purple grace,
He shews his merry face;
Make room, the Sov'reign cries &mdash; he comes!  he comes!

AIR, accompanied by a curious musical clock.
Pinchy's ever fertile brain
Did patent snuffers first ordain;
Pinchy's nicknacks are a treasure,
Pinchy's toys a monarch's pleasure.
Rich the treasure,
Sweet the pleasure,
Sweet is pleasure after pain.

CHORUS.
Pinchy's nicknacks are a treasure, &c.

RECITATIVE.
Sooth'd with the sound the King grew vain,
Sail'd thro' his navy once again,
And in idea thrice he drubb'd the great d'Estaing.
Sandwich beheld the madness rise,
His glowing cheeks, his sullen eyes;
And while he France and Spain defy'd,
Chang'd his hand, and check'd his pride.

RECIT. accompanied.
He chose a mournful muse,
Soft pity to infuse.

AIR.
He sung Britannia, great and good,
By too severe a fate,
Fallen from her high estate,
Defenceless on the flood.
To ruin and destruction led,
By Scotchmen, whom her bounty fed;
On the bare sea expos'd she lies,
To France an easy sacrifice.

CHORUS.
Bold Britannia, great and good,
Defenceless on the flood,
On the bare sea expos'd she lies,
To France an easy sacrifice.

RECITATIVE.
With downcast looks the cloudy monarch sat,
Revolving in his alter'd soul,
The various turns of chance below,
And now and then a sigh he stole,
And tears began to flow.
But Sandwich, tho' with vast surprize,
He saw the monarch's weeping eyes,
Told him it would not be amiss&mdash;
"The more he cry'd, the less he'd &mdash;!"

RECIT. accompanied.
Softly sweet in Scottish measures,
The bagpipe soothes his soul to pleasures.

AIR.
War, he sung, is toil and trouble,
Honour but an empty bubble;
Ease and comfort still refusing;
Fighting still, and still destroying:
Though a crown be worth thy losing,
Turning buttons worth enjoying,
Bute soon again shall sit beside thee,
Take the friends the Scots provide thee.
WAR HE SUNG, &c REPEATED AGAIN.

CHORUS.
Glad Sawney rends the skies with loud applause,
So B&mdash;e was crown'd, and England won the cause.

AIR.
The Prince his joy unable to contain,
Sigh'd for the Thane,
Who caus'd his pain,
And sigh'd and look'd, and sigh'd again.
At length with sailing and with singing tir'd,
Home to his bed the drowsy king retir'd.

CHORUS repeated.
Glad Sawney rends the skies with loud applause,
So B&mdash;e was crown'd, and England won the cause.
END OF THE FIRST ACT.

ACT THE SECOND.
RECIT. accompanied.
Now strike the kettle-drum again,
A louder yet &mdash; and yet a louder strain!
Break his bands of sleep asunder,
And rouse him with salutes as loud as thunder.

CHORUSES.
Break, &c.

RECITATIVE.
Hark, hark!  the martial sound
Has rais'd up his head
After sh&mdash;g a bed,
And amaz'd he stares around.

AIR.
Revenge, revenge, bold Sandwich cries,
See the Furies arise:
See the snakes that they rear,
How they hiss in their hair,
And the sparkles that flash from their eyes.

AIR.
Behold a mournful band
Without arms in their hand,
These are British troops, that in battle were ta'en,
And captive remain
Beyond th' Atlantic main.

RECIT. accompanied.
Give the vengeance due
To Burgoyne's injur'd crew
Behold how they pile up their arms all on high,
How they point to the army of Gates,
And dine in dumb despair off broken plates!

AIR.
The nobles applaud with a furious frown,
And the K&mdash; with a tom'hawk wou'd fain knock them down.

AIR.
Campbell shall lead the way,
And guide him to his prey,
And like another Dunmore fire another town.

CHORUS.
The nobles applaud, &c.
THE FOUR FOLLOWING LINES BEING REPEATED.

RECIT. accompanied.
Not long ago,
When statesmen knew that Western winds cou'd blow,
And Scotchmen yet were mute,
Great Pitt, uncircumscrib'd by B&mdash;e,
With noble fire
Plann'd such amazing deeds, as made the world admire.

GRAND CHORUS.
At length, to blast our glory, came
That Scotchman of detested name;
The dark deceiver, in a cursed hour,
Poison'd his Royal Master's mind;
And fraught with treachery design'd,
Made Britain sue for peace to Bourbon's broken power!

RECITATIVE.
Your voices tune, and raise them high,
Till they echo from the vaulted sky
The Thane's detested name.
To him and N&mdash;th we jointly owe
The ills we now have learn'd to know:
Sound loudly then their shame.
Let B&mdash;e and N&mdash;h divide the block,
Or both at Tyburn swing;
And then, as late in Portsmouth dock,
We'll chaunt, "God save our King!"

GRAND CHORUS, BY ALL THE MINORITY, AND EVERY GOOD SUBJECT IN THE KINGDOM.
THE FOUR PRECEDING LINES REPEATED.
