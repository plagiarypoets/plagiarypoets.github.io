Sweet Eve, of softest voice and gentlest beam,
Say, since the pensive strains thou once didst hear
Of him, the bard sublime of Arun's stream,
Will aught beside delight thy nicer ear?
Me wilt thou give to praise thy shadowy gleam,
Thy fragrant breath, and dying murmurs dear;
The mists that o'er thee from the vallies stream,
And elfin shapes, that round thy car appear;
The music that attends thy state; the bell
Of distant fold; the gently warbling wind,
And watch-dog's hollow voice from cottag'd dell?
For these to purest pleasure wake the mind,
Lull each tumultuous passion to its cell,
And leave soft soothing images behind.
