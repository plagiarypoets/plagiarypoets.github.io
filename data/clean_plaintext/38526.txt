O, sweetest MELANCHOLY, Queen of Sighs,
Deign to admit me to thy pensive train,
Who oft' have listen'd to
Thy strangely-whisper'd strains!
Or thou, mild THOMSON, Nature's meekest child,
Lead thy young Vot'ry!  or, SHAKESPEARE divine,
First of Fancy's children,
From thy fine-phrenzied lore
Teach me to breathe some sadly-soften'd note,
Attun'd to Song of dolorous argument!
For gone is a sweet Nymph
To th' undiscover'd Bourne
From whence the youngest trav'ller ne'er return'd:&mdash;
Rude-handed Death, to crop so fair a Flow'r
Timeless &mdash; just in the Spring
Of Life begun to blow!

So have I seen a Lilly fair:  to-day
Soft-smiling; to-morrow with rude embrace
Of ruffian mildew
Her dainty form distain'd!
And now no more thou'lt lead the festive dance,
Beguiling, wolf-ey'd Winter's dreary Night,
Where Youth tripp'd on with glee
And Beauty grac'd the scene.

And never more that converse meek and mild&mdash;
That heav'n-born grace which ev'ry paint eludes,
Save the fine paint of Thought,
Shall cheer Man's various day!
But in thy lonely bed for ever sleep
Those comely merits, which, op'ning to bloom,
Had in their summer's day
Ripen'd to goodliest fruit!

Then light, oh, Earth, lie on her Maiden Breast;
And ye whose fronts are bright with Fortune's gem
Or gay Ambition's plume&mdash;
Who crop Pleasure's bri'ry Rose,
Bestow the farewell tribute of a sigh.
But ye who framed in Nature's finest mould,
Who thrill at the soft touch
Of Pity &mdash; dove-eyed maid&mdash;
Pour an empassion'd tear.  O Life!  wondrous
Is thy fleet day-dream &mdash; What or whence are we?
We come we know not whence;
We go we know not where.
