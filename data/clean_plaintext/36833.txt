'Tis better far to sit &mdash; to be at rest,
Than press the world's lorn ways with weary feet.
Why should we rise?  why wend to east or west?
The gloom of night we do but go to meet.
Joy flees before us:  and are we so fleet
That we can outrun sorrow &mdash; 'scape from woe?
Let the storm come and rage around our seat,
Come when it listeth; when it listeth, go:
Why should we rise to toil?  our guerdon grief we know.

'Tis better for to sleep, than lie awake
Watching the silent shadows of the night.
'Till in the east the mournful morning break,
And beam through gloomy mists the hateful light.
We turn and toss:  and memory in her flight
Reads but the records of deep-graven sorrow.
We dare not, in the future, hope delight:
For bitter wisdom from the past we borrow:
'Tis better far to sleep, and think not of the morrow.

But better, far than earthly rest or sleep,
Is that repose which waits us in the tomb:
Oh!  it shall be unbroken, silent, deep:
Repose eternal, 'mid eternal gloom:
Sorrow shall be no more man's daily doom;
The storm shall pass unheeded o'er his head;
And, while he slumbers in the earth's dark gloom,
He shall not dream of time to come, or fled.
Oh!  then how sweet to die, and slumber with the dead.

"And who doth say so? &mdash; oh!  he hath not heard
What the blest voice of Grace and Wisdom spoke:
He hath not known, or will not know, the Word:
And o'er his path Hope's rays have never broke:
Oh!  happiest they who toil, and bless the yoke,
Ask here no rest; and, full of cheerful faith,
Pass fearless 'mid the storms that hath awoke,
Darkling around them, the Almighty's breath:
These look beyond the grave, and these may welcome death."
