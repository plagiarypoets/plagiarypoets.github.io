"Haste, dearest maid, and view a sight indeed!
Haste, and behold upon the verdant plains,
Where Love exulting sports,
And waves his purple wings;
What wills the archer?  neither dart nor bow
Are near him laid; nought save a silken snare,
Which the sly urchin spreads
Beneath the myrtle's shade.&mdash;
&mdash;Stay, thoughtless child!  nor, like those cruel elves
By mortals called School-boys, joy in woe!
Oh!  spare the orphans cries,
And widow'd mother's tears!
Stay, and contemplate how they jocund rove,
As rising fancy bids them.  Do not go
To act a Demon's part,
Delighting to destroy.&mdash;
&mdash;He recks not, ELIZA!  see, the snare
Enfolds the fluttering warblers; CUPID springs
With rapture in his eyes,
Triumphant on the prey.&mdash;
&mdash;Stay yet, insatiate boy, thy murtherous hand!
In pity melt, and set the prisoners free;
For VENUS, sure, would weep
To view a deed so rude.
Though slender threads around their pretty legs
Thou sportive bindest, swiftly let them fly!
Thanks, gentle CUPID, thanks,
For this thy tender gift.
But, sure the threads which round them thou hast cast
Will much impede the rovers in their flight?
&mdash;Ah, no!  for, see, each thread
Around a favourite twines;
And the enamour'd pairs seek HYMEN'S aid.
The rosy God descends, and from his plumes
Shakes happiness and peace
O'er all the festive scene."
"Alas, LORENZO!  as thou shew'st the Fair
The gentle blessings which from CUPID spring,
How didst thou sigh, to think
That fortune was thy foe!
