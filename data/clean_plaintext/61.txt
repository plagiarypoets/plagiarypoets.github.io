Grave Muses, march in Triumph and with Praises,
Our Goddess here hath given you leave to land;
And bids this rare Dispenser of your Graces,
Bow down his Brow unto her sacred Hand.
Desert finds due in that most princely Doom,
In whose sweet Breast are all the Muses bred:
So did that great Augustus erst in Rome,
With Leaves of Fame, adorn his Poets hed.
Fair be the Guerdon of your Fairy-Queen,
Even of the fairest that the World hath seen.
