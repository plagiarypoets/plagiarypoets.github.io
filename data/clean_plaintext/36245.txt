There beats not, heaven!  beneath thine azure cope,
One heart, unsway'd by passion's tyrant force&mdash;
Wherever fixed its views of earthly scope,
Wherever bends desire its eager course;
Lured by love's lute, or roused by trumpet hoarse,
On flowers to couch, or rush to fields of war;
Thirsting for joy from gain's polluted source,
In trade's rich mart, or law's loud wrangling bar,
The hermit in his cell, the chief in vic'try's car.
