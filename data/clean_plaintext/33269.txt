My heart was no lesse cut with Care then his
Because he staid not to heare my excuse,
I know he deem'd I willing did amisse,
Which did more sorrow in my soule infuse:
Taking no leave, He faire Vienna leaves,
Accompany'd with Care-increasing griefes.

All-woe-begone, He wanders here and there,
Lookes most for rest when furthest from resort,
Submits himselfe soley to sad Despaire,
With cheering-comfort He cannot comport:
At last He came unto an obscure shade,
Where mirthlesse Melancholy mansion had.

Low on the ground grew Isope, Wormewood, Rew,
The mourning mouting trees white Cypresse green,
Whose twining tops so close together grew,
They all seem'd as they but one Bow had beene;
Covering a spacious Tombe where cursed Care
Her selfe had sepulchriz'd with dire Despaire.

No wanton Bird there warbled loving layes,
There was no merry Merle, Gold-Finch, or Thrush;
No other hopping Bird in higher sprayes,
No mourning Nightengale in lower bush:
The carcasse-craving-Raven, Night-Crow, Owle,
In this darke grove their hatefull notes did howle.

This sullen seat doth sute well with his soule,
There throwes himselfe downe in the bitter weeds;
His heart did thrust out sighs, his tongue condole,
His watring eyes with bitter moisture feeds
These haplesse herbes, there 'gins he to lament,
With interrupting sighs his woes to vent.
