Methought I saw in vision t' other morn,
Celestial reason in her azure vest:
A star there was, which blaz'd upon her breast,
And placid sweetness did her brow adorn.
Firm judgment here, and gentle candour stood,
With meek-ey'd charity, beside the queen;
With many graces more; but chief was seen
Instruction, hand in hand, with public good.
Attendant these on heavenly reason came,
And on religion's shrine an offering laid;
I saw it straight her whole attention claim:
The what it was, how could I but enquire?
Instant with rapture, "'tis my son's," she said;
"The polish'd page of my judicious SQUIRE."
