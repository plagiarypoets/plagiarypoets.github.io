Harp of the Pats!  that rotting long hast lain
On the soft bosom of St. Allen's bog,
And, when the Wind had fits, wouldst twang a strain,
Till envious mud did all thy musick clog,
E'en just as too much pudding chokes a dog;&mdash;
Oh!  Paddy's Harp!  still sleeps thine accent's pride?
Will nobody be giving it a jog?
Still must thou silent be, as when espied
Upon an Irish, old, old halfpenny's back side?

Not thus, when Erin wore a wilder shape,
Thy Voice was speechless in an Irish Town;
It roused the hopeless Lover to a rape,
Made timorous Tenants knock proud Landlords down;
Whisky, at every pause, the feast did crown;&mdash;
Now, by the powers!  the fun was never slack;
The Os and Macs were frisky as the Clown;
For, still, the burthen (growing now a hack)
Was Hubbaboo, dear joys!  and Didderoo!  and Whack!

Och!  wake again!  arrah, get up once more!
And let me venture just to take a thrum:&mdash;
Wake, and be damn'd!  you've had a tightish snore!&mdash;
Perhaps, I'd better let you lie there, dumb:
Yet, if one Ballad-Monger like my strain,
Though I've a clumsy finger and a thumb,
I shan't have jingled Minstrelsy in vain;&mdash;
So, Wizard, be alive!  old Witch, get up again! . . .
