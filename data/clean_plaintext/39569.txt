Ye lovers, so sprightly and young,
Whose hearts never bitterly pine,
Who ramble the woodlands among,
Enrapt with their music divine:
O!  list to my sorrowful lay,
To the tortures I'm forc'd to endure;
But if you won't hear what I say,
Why that I can't help I am sure!

I have liv'd, but alas!  all in vain&mdash;
I have stuck to the fair one I chose&mdash;
I thought that she lov'd me again,
For she always kept treading my toes!
My body is scarlet and blue
With the treatment I've often receiv'd;
You may think the confession not true,
If not &mdash; I am grossly deceiv'd!

At even when the gentle gales blow,
I steal to her dwelling of clay;
And pressing her bosom of snow,
Fall down on my marrows to pray:
To beg that she'll be friendly and kind,
And yield to my tender desire;
But she swears she was never inclin'd
In the arms of a bard to expire!

I urge her to list to my strain,
But the devil a word will she speak;
I beg her to solace my pain,
But this to her ladyship's Greek:
With trouble confounded and sad
I pensively roam thro' the dale,
Then go to the cot of her dad,
To blubber my pitiful tale.

I talk of my learning and wit&mdash;
My skill in the verse-making line,
I fall in a desperate fit,
And grumble and grunt like a swine:
The mother, alarm'd at my case,
Runs swift to the neighbouring stream;
Sprinkles water all over my face,
And thus puts an end to the dream.

Awaken'd, as you may suppose,
I rush'd to the dark shady grove;
But, the last time, I fell on my nose,
Which soon put a stop to my love:
I call for the aid of my fair&mdash;
Till echo grows sick of my voice,
But, alas!  Dollalolla takes care
To turn a deaf ear to my noise.
