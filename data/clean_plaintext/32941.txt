Did Braggadochio meete a man in field?
Tis true, he did, the way he could not shun:
And did he force great Brundon weapons yeeld;
Nay there he lies.  To untrusse when he begun,
He stole his weapons and away did run:
Vaine is thy vaunt, and victorie unjust,
Thou durst not stay till he his points untrust.
