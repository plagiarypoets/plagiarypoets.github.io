Hyle that the Sunne with his beames hot,
Scorched the fruits in vale and mountaine:
Philon the sheperd late forgot,
Sitting besides a Christall fountaine,
In shadow of a greene Oke tree,
Uppon his Pipe this song playd he:
Untrue love, untrue love, untrue love,
Adew love, adew love, your mind is light,
Your minde is light, soone lost for new love.

So long as I was in your sight,
I was as your hart, your soule, your treasure,
And evermore you sobb'd, you sigh'd,
Burning in flames beyond all measure,
Three dayes endur'd your Love to me,
And it was lost in other three.
Adew love adew love untrue love,
Untrue love untrue love adew love,
Your mynd is light, soone lost for new love.

Another shepherd you dyd see,
To whome your hart was soone enchayned,
Full soone your love was leapt from me,
Full soone my place he had obtayned,
Soone came a third your love to winne,
And we were cut and he was in,
Adew love, &c.

Sure you have made me passing glad,
That you your mynd so soone removed,
Before that I the leysrue had,
To chuse you for my best beloved,
For all my love was past and doonne,
Two dayes before it was begoonne.
Adew Love &c.
