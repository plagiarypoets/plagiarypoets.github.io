Of Old, in Scottish land, a Sire there lived,
Whose toil in youth had stores prepared for age,
Who now from care, though scarce from toil reprieved,
With earthly thoughts an easier war could wage,
And lest of fear or favour felt the edge:
His children grown, had sought employment round,
As different toils their various tastes engage,
And he, though scarce by need to labour bound,
Yet loved to tend his team, and till the fruitful ground.

On slope of sunward hill his cot was placed,
In cultured holm, 'mid furze-surrounded scene,
Where isles of corn were gained from Alpine waste,
And 'mid enclosing rocks were pastures seen;
Before his door was spread the daisied green,
Where browzed the cottage nurse, his brinded cow,
By grandchild led, the furzy knolls between,
Who sought the spots where sweetest daisies grow,
And lesson conned the while, along that mountain's brow.

That wealthy cot of rude exterior seemed,
Its charms the dwellers, not the gazers, found;
In eyes romantic scarce befitting deemed,
To grace the blooming wilds that laughed around:
And all within to antique modes was bound;
The hearth amid the central floor was placed,
Where sire and sons might sit in circle round;
And up the spacious vent, with wicker braced,
Might school-boy grandchild mark each zenith star that passed.

One southward window looked adown the green,
Where wont his daughter young her wheel to ply,
And view the roses round her casement sheen,
Or tulips bright in tidy garden nigh,
Whose flowers might Sunday's ornament supply,
Or lie, for mark, beside her pastor's hymn;
Here too, when snowy loured December's sky,
She lov'd to see, through window frosted-dim,
The blackbirds peck her crumbs, or round her garden skim.

To fairy lake was there a streamlet spread,
Whose grassy banks were bright with purest green,
And here, when June his brightening influence shed,
The housewife's pearly webs were bleaching seen,
From seed to cloth that still her care had been;
There, too, the maid betrothed might stranger view,
In satin snood and kilted kirtle clean,
Her linen stores prepare, of lilied hue,
Pure like her virgin self, the married couch to strew.

Apart, on airy knoll, his stacks were seen,
Y-thatched with broom, with twisted sedges bound;
And garden here was stretched in chequered green,
With ranks of leafy trees protected round;
And here his leisure hours employment found&mdash;
To tend the sunny hives, the soil to feed,
For various plants to fit the equal ground,
To trim the walk, to root the envious weed,
Or rill, by sedges choked, in purer stream to lead.

Here, too, on Sunday morn, in corner green,
Where branching lime her shadowy arches raised,
He loved to sit:  where through the leafy screen
The humming bees, with honeyed blossoms pleased,
Like hymn from distant church, innumerous praised
The God to whom his morning prayers were said;
And here, at times, from weekly tasks released,
Around his knee, his youthful grandsons played,
Or glad in sacred lore their infant skill displayed.

This wight's fair fame the Elder's charge had won,
And well his equal life such trust approved&mdash;
By haughtiest wealth as independent known,
By poorest toil as fellow labourer loved;
His praise was dear to all; if he reproved,
Nor frowned the rich, nor jealous railed the poor:
From him whose life in equal toils has moved,
Will poverty severest truths endure,
And who, nor needs nor fears, with wealth shall chide secure.

The reverend man my earlier years have seen,
On Sunday morn the church-way gate beside,
(An antique porch, with fry mantled green,
By beech's earliest boughs o'ershadowed wide,)
There stood the Patriarch gray, and near his aide
The entering peasants laid their friendly mite
For brethren's wants:  while each, with grateful pride,
From his applauding eye the warm delight
Received, of charity "twice blessed," of kindness done aright.

I've seen him, too, at times the boon divide,
By pitying brethren thus collected kind,
Yet few were those, I wot, whom kindred's pride
To general pity careless then resigned&mdash;
For not as now was wealth to few confined,
Who owned no kindred tie with lowlier toil&mdash;
But far diffused; each peasant then could find,
(While smaller farms left free th' enriching soil)
Some kind relation near, whose wealth relieved his coil.

Yet those whom poverty reluctant sent,
With kindest care the Elder's hand relieved,
As patriarch old within his evening tent,
The pilgrim's wearied footsteps glad received;
No fears were there, lest charity deceived,
Should nourish listless vice with boon prepared
For humble want; in equal toils had lived,
Both he who dealt and he the boon that shared,
And wasting idler there, of welcome still despaired.

Bright from his cottage lay, far stretched below,
A chequered valley, rich in woods and corn,
Where many a hamlet's light was seen to glow
At darkening eve; where soft at earliest morn
From many a cot the spiry smoke was borne,
First mark of man a-stir; a village wide,
Where gardens broad the straggling cots adorn,
Was near below; shone verdant down beside,
Where lowed the milky herd, the hamlet's common pride.

How sweet at eve, when loom and anvil's sound,
That thro' that village day had ceaseless rung,
Was hushed; when forth from busiest sheds around,
Their tasks performed, the eager tradesmen flung,
To drink the breeze of heaven in joyous throng,
And pleasure seek in healthful change of toil:
Some feed their cherished cows; with hatchet strong
Some fuel-store prepare; in softer moil
Some prop the blooming pea, and court the genial soil.

And some, when now those leisure cares are done,
Beneath some elm on western slope convene,
Where name-carved bench is placed for evening sun,
And northern grove protects the quiet scene;
There many a rustic theme consumes the e'en,
And all of ill or good that peasants feel
From laws and wars and kings is heard between;
Some tell their wrongs, the cause would some reveal,
And some, sagacious more, propound the means to heal.

And here the Elder too might oft be found,
Here loved at eve to list the eager theme,
To hear the peasants deal their praises round,
Or cast on "ruling powers" their whispered blame;
Could oft, with word revered, allay the flame
Of vexed complaint:  his glance, with anger fired,
Could break the young declaimer's airy dream
(By lawless books, those whispering toads, inspired)
That soars to freedoms wild, of slow experience tired.

Yet small the charm declaimer's theme can bring
(If public wants not pinch the peasant's store,
And teach him jealousy) to village ring,
That meets to toll the rustic business o'er
And themes of home.  Their fond attention more
Was won (while yet such kindred theme was given)
While Elder scanned th' assembled preachers' lore,
Whose rival eloquence had fondly striven
To win the hearts of men, and deck the rites of heaven.

They loved to hear how 'mid some mountain dell
Where emerald grass with pearly daisies shone,
And blooming furze diffused its fragrant smell,
While o'er some neighbouring grove on hillock lone
By ancient church the wandering eye was won&mdash;
How mingling here with breeze's fading sound,
Was heard in cadence mild, like hermit's tone,
The preacher's voice; and how innumerous round
Delighted hearers sat, in fond attention wound.

How there that preacher stood, like him of old,
Who, 'mid the wilds of Judah's desert plain,
To gathering thousands awful warning told
Of high Messiah's dread approaching reign;
How there, like him he poured his eager strain
'Mid lonely dell of far sequestered height,
Repentant hearts for christain life to gain,
And trembling souls to fit for awful rite,
Where Saviour's dying love bursts full on mortal sight.

When rose their choral hymn's aerial tide,
How sweet the mellowed sound apart to hear,
Beneath some mountain grove's o'ershadowing side,
Like songs of Eden poured on Adam's ear
From groves where angels walked; while, listening near,
By hillock green, young wedded pair was seen,
Who soothed, with fond caress, their infant's tear,
Lest childish wail invade the listening scene,
And break those sounds of praise where angels heark to men.

Such theme the peasant loved:  such scene sublime
By grandsire's foot he oft had tripped to see,
And recollections fond of earliest time,
And charms beloved of native scenery,
Were mingled there with rites that holiest be;
And round the Elder oft, such tale to hear,
They eager thronged beneath their village tree;
To them than senates' lore that tale more dear,
Or all of war and fight that fills the city's ear.

So passed their eve:  and then would Elder stray
To neighb'ring cot, where, lov'd and welcome guest,
He whiled in rural tall the hours away:
The father's serious tale, the youngster's jest,
The damsel's song, the child in frolic blest;
Each gay, by turns amused the cheerful sire:
The young enjoy their mirth, the old their rest,
And all to please their honoured guest conspire,
While, mid the jovial ring, gleams bright their bickering fire.

And might, at times, misfortune's frown severe
Such gladsome scene to hopeless sadness turn;
Did pinching want extort a murmuring tear,
And bid their wearied hearts in silence mourn,
Or urge despair in angry words to burn;
While stranger's kindness half-degrading seemed,
And tore their wounded pride with newer thorn:&mdash;
The Elder's step was ne'er intrusive deemed:
Familiar oft before, for kindness still esteemed.

And oft when frightened wealth in vain had tried
Each wonted art the peasant vexed to sooth,
Had smiled, and glozed, and half-concealed his pride,
And mingled promise fair and speeches smooth,
Yet met but sullen looks in every booth;
The Elder's voice, in all its words sincere,
Could lull to peace his brethren's passions wroth;
Their sufferings just in patience taught to bear,
Or shewed by rightful path to reach their ruler's ear.

Even she, that maid, around whose youthful breast
Consumption's serpent coils were firmly wound,
Whose feverish heart each visit now oppressed,
While shrunk her startled ear from every sound,
The Elder's converse still delightful found;
While he, to win her ear, would cheerful tell
Of evenings spent her parents' hearth around,
Where friend to friend was joined in social spell:
Then led her thoughts from earth on bliss supreme to dwell.

How different he, the haughty pastor, sent
Amid this humble flock "the Word" to preach!
Who ne'er within such humble threshold went,
Save (yearly task) some stern advice to teach,
Or, called perchance, at death's impending breach:
Can dying men of such regard the care,
Whose tardy steps with death the port but reach?
A signal known, his visit speaks despair,
Alarms the feverish heart, and thought bewilders there.

When reapers keen on harvest fields were met,
This wight for many an useful deed was loved:
Disjointed limb his ready skill could set,
And wound from sickle rough his salve removed,
Whene'er the youngster's mirth too freely roved,
One little word from him its flight restrained;
And maid that, blushing, half that flight approved,
Yet blessed his care for purer mirth regained,
And youth in freedom met &mdash; thus age preserved unstained.

At Harvest-home he loved the mirthful feast,
Where master's  welcome servants' cares beguiled
Where met the youth in mutual kindness blessed,
Who late in rival strength had eager toiled:
When down the dance the maiden grateful smiled
On him whose care her harvest's toil had eased;
When rustic mirth flung round in antics wild,
And youth rejoiced from yearly toils released,
While age sat gladsome near, like guardian angel pleased.

And much he wont th' ungenerous pride to blame
Of masters stern, to mushroom riches grown,
Who thus to mix with labour deemed it shame,
And gave for wonted feast the sordid boon;
'Twixt youth and age the bait for discord sown,
That neither pleased, and both with strife defiled;
For careful age will hoard the pittance thrown,
And youth, of age's decent care despoiled,
Will seek unsanctioned mirth, to sinful joys beguiled.

With bitterest smile the Elder oft would list,
When men of wealth, in piteous mood, complained
Of peasants now depraved, of virtues ceased,
And rural manners old, with vice distained,
And schemes of pride where simplest order reigned&mdash;
Alas!  themselves the cause!  their pride of shew
To mix with lowlier toil has long disdained&mdash;
Each jealous rank repels each rank below,
Familiar guardian once, a stern inspector now.

How far the ill descends!  the farmer's hall,
Where lived the servants once, beneath the care
Of master kind &mdash; the friend, the guide of all&mdash;
Is changed and lost; reigns pride unbending there
And forth to cheerless booth must servants fare,
Their hasty mess unblessed, alone to snatch,
And meet unguarded every youthful snare;
While master's stern advice, or hated watch,
But fires their rival pride, his wealthier vice to match.

Yet why in bitter words thus speak severe?
Thus ne'er the Elder's voice would harshly chide;
Oft stubborn vice would draw his secret tear,
And oft his care would indignation hide,
Lest stern reproof might wake the sinner's pride,
And shut the angry ear to all approach:
By kindness still he loved the heart to guide,
On sad remorse would careful ne'er encroach,
And jealous pride could lull, yet waken self-reproach.

As through the western pane of mountain cot,
Where maiden sings and plies her evening wheel,
Across the door is sunny raylet shot,
Where child pursues the atoms' glittering reel,
And grand-dame loves the sunny warmth to feel;
While sparkling light the beamy wanderer throws
On all that housewife's care would fain conceal,
And o'er her dusky shelves resplendent glows,
And playful pleases still, while every speck it shews;

Thus playful still his kind reproof was shed,
Thus unoffending every fault could show:&mdash;
Nor less to generous deeds his precepts led;
As when at dawn from orchard's blooming bough
Some feathered songster's notes melodious flow,
And sleeping maid awake to cheerful toil,
Who trims her parent's cot ere forth she go,
To milk her cows or join the harvest's moil;&mdash;
Thus he to deeds of worth, the heart could wakening wile.

No words sarcastic e'er defiled his tongue,
Those poisoned arrows shot by ambushed pride!
Such oft in sly rebuke the heart have stung,
Oft driven the penitent his faults to hide,
But wanderer ne'er regained to virtue's side;
From lily fallen he dried remorseful shower,
Nor let the worm despair beneath it bide;
And oft with kindly touch revived the flower
That cold neglect or scorn had thrown to vice's power.

No angry satire guided e'er his speech
On class of men a general blame to throw&mdash;
Of kings or mobs, or good or ill to teach:&mdash;
For men, he said, in common frailty grow,
By weal corrupted some, and some by woe;
As mid some rocky cavern's darksome hall,
Where stalagmitic veins exuding flow,
Wild shapes arise as drops incessant fall,
Thus men unconscious change, thus custom works on all.

Such truths the Elder taught; but most he loved
Of wayward youth the devious paths to guide;
Their generous warmth to duteous deeds he moved,
And lured their pride of heart to virtue's side:
And many a wanderer bears his memory wide,
Thro' distant lands where Scotia's sons are loved,
And tells on Indian shore with grateful pride,
How first the Elder's praise, to deeds approved,
Amid his native hills, his youthful bosom moved.

But if from roamings far such wanderer come,
And bend his path the Elder's cot to find;
Alas!  no more is there the sage's home;
Along the hill all lonely sweeps the wind,
Nor mark is there of social humankind;
Of scattered sheep is heard the tinkling bell,
And shivering Lad is there, by rock reclined,
To watch his flock, that seeks on desert fell,
Some spot of greener sward, or kindlier sheltered dell.

That shepherd points afar the sacred ground,
Where now the Elder sleeps in silent grave;
And leaves his flock, to guide the wanderer round
The site, where once the cot its shelter gave;
Where now some lonely trees their branches wave,
Sole remnant left of all that there had been,&mdash;
Which he who crushed the rest had deigned to save,
To deck, perchance like ancient tomb, the scene,
To wanderer's grieving heart, memorial sad I ween.
