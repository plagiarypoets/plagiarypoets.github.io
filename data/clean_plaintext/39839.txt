Since Damon inconstant is grown,
Now fortune encreases his store;
And leaves his Lucinda to mourn,
Because she is humble and poor.

No more I'll appear on the plain,
Nor the cause will I ever relate;
But far from the village remain,
And in silence weep over my fate.

Ah why does my bosom thus beat!
Why the form he so flatter'd thus fade!
He surely deserves no regret,
Who can falsely forsake a weak maid.

Let it ne'er in my absence be told,
The sorrow with which I withdrew;
For he that could leave me for gold,
Would jest at a maiden so true.

Adieu then ungenerous swain,
Thy form from my bosom I'll tear,
If ever thou see'st me again,
It shall be when I'm laid on my bier.
