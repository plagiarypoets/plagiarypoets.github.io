Hail, SAV'RY COMPOUND!  luscious to the taste;
The school-boy's heart delighting!  sweet reward
Of many a tedious hour in penance sad
Of lab'ring erudition.  Oft hast thou
Been brought to view by strong anticipation,
When poring over books, or conning loath
The lesson of dull grammar.  When at school
The scanty table nothing did present
But suet dumplings, or hard mutton boil'd,
How has thy minc'd-meat danc'd before the eyes
Of greedy visionary!  how possess'd
The mazes of his brain!  then to his view
Did his dear HOME return; his parents' smiles,
His evening visits, and perhaps his joy
At Play house, where the busy Pantomime
Bewitch'd the time away.  Then to return
To sup, to eat MINCE PIES!  drink luscious wine!
To keep the list'ning circle list'ning still,
'Till after midnight, when the little ELF,
On his soft pillow, DREAMS OF SCHOOL AGAIN!
