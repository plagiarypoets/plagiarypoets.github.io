In a child's voice, is there not melody?
In a child's eye, is there not rapture seen?
And rapture not of passion's revelry;
Calm, though impassioned; durable, though keen!
It is all fresh, like the young spring's first green!
Children seem spirits from above descended,
To whom still cleave Heaven's atmosphere serene;
Their very wildnesses with truth are blended;
Fresh from their skiey mould, they cannot be amended.

Warm and uncalculating, they're more wise,&mdash;
More sense than ecstasy of their's denotes,&mdash;
More of the stuff have they of Paradise,
And more the music of the warbling throats
Of choirs whose anthem round th' Eternal floats,
Than all that bards e'er feigned; or tuneful skill
Has e'er struck forth from artificial notes:
Their's is that language, ignorant of ill,
Born from a perfect harmony of power and will.
