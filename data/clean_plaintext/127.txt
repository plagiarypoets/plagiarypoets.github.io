Some Tales to tell, would I a Chaucer were:
Yet would I not even-now an Homer be:
Though Spencer me hath often Homer term'd:
And Monsieur Bodine vow'd as much as he.
Envy, and Zoilus, two busy wightes:
No petty shade of Homer can appeere,
But he the Divell, and she his Dam display:
And Furies fell annoy sweete Muses cheere.
Nor Martins I, nor Counter-martins squibb:
Enough a doo, to clere my simple selfe:
Momus gainst Heaven; and Zoilus gainst Earth,
A Quipp for Gibeline; and whip for Guelph.
Or purge this humour; or woe-worth the State,
That long endures the one, or other mate.
