TO BEAUTY.
Offspring of Form and Tint!  Beauty bright-sparkling!
Before thy shrine this votive verse I lay,
Illuming Angel of this sphere, so darkling,
Oh!  with thy lustrous radiance light my way;
Pour on my soul the lovely and the gay,
E'en as thou paint'st the throne of orient Morn;
Gleam'st in the bright, prismatic, seven-fold ray;
Shin'st in the flowers, the garden that adorn,
Laugh in the mead, and stud with stars the lawn;
Glow'st in the diamond, lucid as the light,
That of its brilliance never can be shorn;
And beam'st in Woman to perfection's height,
Whose eyes are thine, that eloquent can speak,
As thine, the soft carnation of her cheek.

THE JUICE OF THE GRAPE.
Juice of the Grape, 'tis thine to cheer the heart,
To make pale Sadness from her reverie spring,
And to her drooping spirits to impart
Young Rhetoric's tongue and Fancy's soaring wing.
Juice of the Grape!  the sons of Phoebus sing
Thus of thy virtue and thy wondrous power;
But o'er the lyre as I my fingers fling,
I cannot join them at this lonely hour.
Poison will often lurk beneath the flower,
And Beauty, faithless prove, tho' heavenly-fair.
Juice of the Grape, then is not thine the power,
Man to unman, and make him rashly dare
All strange and all unutterable things,
Unaw'd by Conscience or Remorse's stings.
