On the side of a murmuring stream,
As lately I laid myself down,
Ye Shepherds, I chose for my theme,
To mark how the waters did run.

So sweetly they seem'd for to play,
And bubbled, and bubbled along,
I said, pretty stream!  play away,
And charm me again with thy song.

The pebbles, so neat, and so clean,
So handsomely spread on the ground,
Did also contribute, I ween,
To send forth a musical sound.

Ah!  murmur, still murmur, says I,
And up I arose on my feet;&mdash;
But being, ye Shepherds, too nigh,
My stockings and shoes they were wet.

Then home to my cottage I'll go,
And, tho' there no reason be why,
I'll give up myself to my woe,
And when my time comes &mdash; I will die!
