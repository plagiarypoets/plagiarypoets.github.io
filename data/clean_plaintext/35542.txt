Sleep, wayward thoughts, and rest you with my love.
Let not my love be with my love displeas'd:
Touch not, proud hands, lest you her anger move,
But pine you with my longings, long diseas'd.
Thus while she sleeps I sorrow for her sake;
So sleeps my love; and yet my love doth wake.

But oh!  the fury of my restless fear!
The hidden anguish of my warm desires!
The glories and the beauties that appear
Between her brows near Cupid's closed fires!
Thus while she sleeps I languish for her sake;
So sleeps my love, my love, and yet my love doth wake.

My love doth rage, and yet my love doth rest;
Fear in my love, and yet is my love secure;
Peace in my love, and yet my love opprest;
Impatient, yet of perfect tempratour.
Sleep, dainty love, while I sigh for thy sake;
So sleeps my love; and yet my love doth wake.
