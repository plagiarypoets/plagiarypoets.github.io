If manly sense, and flowing ease,
With elegance combin'd,
And genius rare have pow'r to please,
I, thus, declare my mind&mdash;
To alter lines that you have penn'd,
Would be to me, what we would mend.

You soar above all critic rules,
With eagle's pinions aid,
And leave to dullards and to fools
Those shackles they have made:
Then let them wear the pressive chain,
While you aloft in freedom reign.

In you, a Shakespeare is reviv'd,
In Nature's fine display:
Into our bosoms deep you've div'd,
And found each leading way,
To where each passion keeps its court,
And thus our feelings are your sport.

You sooth, alarm, distress, relieve,
With pictures genius drawn.
For Nature's Portraits we receive
Some trac'd upon thy lawn,
The rest, no archetypes we find,
Creation form'd them in thy mind.

In you a Spencer's fancy glows
In all her fairy rays:
You make our very joys and woes
To breathe a being's days:
For ev'ry line, the Poet's lyre,
Hath kindled with Promethean fire.

As Milton, you are all sublime.
Each line's a daring flight,
Amid the highest region clime,
That blest a poet's flight.
I, therefore, silently adore
That merit which I can't praise more.
