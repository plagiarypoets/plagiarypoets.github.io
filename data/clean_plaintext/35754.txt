To thee, that art the glory of our days,
And patron of all princely gentleness,
This image of delight my Muse conveys,
To be accepted of thy nobleness;
That with thy favour Thou the same may'st bless,
And shield great Sidney from detracting wrong,
Sith his pure lines to purer ears express
All musick, both of wisdom, and of tongue;
And sith in his most sweet heroick song,
As in a mirror, thou may'st timely see
The virtues, that exempt thee from the throng,
And make thy life divinest poesy;
Therefore, great Lord, vouchsafe this book to take,
Both for its own, and for its Author's sake.
