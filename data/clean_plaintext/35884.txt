Farewell, vain hope of an enlarged fame,
That may endure, when brass and stone decay,
Fenc'd against Envy's rage, and Season's blame,
Built in opinion, which no tongue can slay;
Most dear imagination of true sway
In souls, that 'gainst their chequer'd ages sleep,
E'en to the sharp edge of the dooming day,
Farewell, I say, but as I say it, weep.
For I with thee did dear communion keep,
False though thou art, a painted forgery;
And yet for all my love no good I reap,
That day and night had only thought of thee;
O frail diminish'd dream, to thee farewell,
No soul, that lives, can love thee half so well!
