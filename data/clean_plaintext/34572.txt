Favour'd of Heaven!  on whom the Graces wait,
To whom the Virtues ev'ry gift impart,
In thee, confest, we own whate'er is great,
The noblest sentiments, the tenderest heart;
From scenes of death, thrice welcome to this isle,
Secure where Plenty, Peace, and heav'n-born Freedom smile!

How blest thy lot!  no trumpet's shrill alarms
At midnight hour shall pierce thy trembling ear;
No soldier's lawless shout, nor clashing arms,
Shall rack thy tortur'd breast with endless fear:
No longer shalt thou view repining swains
Lament in speechless grief their desolated plains.

No tott'ring walls, enwrapt in hostile fires,
Shall sadly sink before thy pitying eye;
Torn from the mother's breast no babe expires;
No groans of shrieking widows rend the sky;
The sword impure assails no hoary head;
No hapless virgin weeps her violated bed.

Far other scenes these happier plains afford,
This scepter'd isle!  the golden harvest here,
Cut by the sickle, not the soldier's sword,
Falls when full ripen'd by th' autumnal year;
With plenty crown'd, each shepherd, void of care,
In transport tunes his reed, and smiles at distant war.

Handmaids of Peace, see ev'ry Art divine,
In sweetest union, find a sure retreat;
And, foster'd here, with brighter lustre shine,
Than erst in Greece or Rome, their boasted seat;
Nor silent sits the Muse whose sacred string
Bids live in verse Albion's best-lov'd King.

Such scenes as these best suit thy gentle heart,
For thou canst taste the joys which others know;
Yet not unconscious to another's smart,
Canst bid the sympathetic tear to flow;
O when thou heard'st thy ravag'd country groan,
Thou felt'st her slightest wounds, and mad'st each pang thine own.

These were the charms that fixt the Monarch's choice;
He saw thee grac'd with ev'ry nobler art;
He knew thee worthy of a nation's voice,
Form'd not to please alone, but gain the heart;
He saw, with female elegance refin'd,
In thee reflected back the image of his mind.
