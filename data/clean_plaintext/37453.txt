The golden robe that crowns the playful day
Rides thro' the ocean in the boundless skies,
Diffusive murmurs roll the brilliant way,
Till day's bright herald drops the scene, and dies.

See!  yonder blaze that gilds the lucid air
Call ev'ry beauty from the fruitful dale;
Attend, each odour, mount the tyrant's car,
You must not stay to bless the lovely vale.

And you, ye hills, whom kinder influence knows,
Who first receive the many-spangled beams,
On whose vast top the morning chariot grows,
And shoots the virtue of its sultry streams;

You must be left to revel with the glooms
That play in circles round your ancient pile,
And barter darkness for the rich illumes
That gave your huge solemnity a smile.

Ye limpid sheets, that trickle thro' the grove
O'er banks of pebble!  hail, delightful streams,
Where Nature dictates ev'ry thought to rove,
The lover's rapture, or the poet's dreams.

In vain ye swell!  the foaming eddies round
Involv'd in dusk, your ringlets claim no charm;
Yet as you rush across the rural ground,
Indulge my fancy with a soft alarm.

Ye lovely herds, be gone to slumb'ring folds;
Sweet rest!  that knows no horrid pangs of thought!
No conscious guilt disturbs your happy holds,
Nor lust of pow'r &mdash; that pow'r so dearly bought!

And you, ye choir, whose Hallelujahs ring
In floating warbles thro' the early breeze,
Cease your loud sonnets, till the day shall spring,
And seek repose in yonder awful trees.

This grey-clad scene, remote from common view,
Where by yon gliding brook and tufted bow'r
My Friend and I an heart-felt language knew,
The sympathetic transport of each hour:

This spot serene now sinks in hallow'd gloom;
The shady elm-tree, and the dimpled flood;
Droops into silence ev'ry living bloom,
The sweets unnumber'd of the darken'd wood.

See there!  the sober clouds, in chequ'ring nod,
Court other vapours to the dark display;
Till form'd in heaps together swim abroad,
And Night's black ensign takes the place of Day.
