Vain was resistance.  We were swift conveyed
Into a spacious hall most richly dight,
In tapestry of freshest hues arrayed,
And glittering with an aching blaze of light,
Reflected from a thousand mirrors bright.
The arras told the stories of all those
Who had ascended to the loftiest height
Of worldly power &mdash; by Fortune's aid who rose
E'en from the basest grade, through circumstance and foes.

The Scythian shepherd's tale might there be read,
The mighty Tamerlane, and thousands more;
But chiefly mark'd I one, who on his head
The diadems of two fair kingdoms wore;
Two sceptres also in one hand he bore,
And with the other scatter'd honours round,
While Victory long his legions flew before.&mdash;
But soon I saw him stretch'd upon the ground,
And he who empires gave, was now a captive bound.

Calm and majestic was he, though undone&mdash;
His royal heart could never be subdued;
Still to the last his ardent spirit shone,
And as the settling sun more nobly show'd,
E'en for the clouds that his decline pursued.
Few friends remained &mdash; but they preserv'd their faith
In worst extremes with generous fortitude;
They serv'd their master to his latest breath,
Through all his sufferings, bitterer far than death.
