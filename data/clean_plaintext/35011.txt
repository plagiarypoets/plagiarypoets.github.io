When Venus did desend from heven above,
To vewe the earthe, which longe time she had lefte,
(For since Diana had destroyed hir love,
The woddes and feilds weare of hir sighte berefte;)
Itt was hir chaunc on Daymon for to finde,
Whos yealdinge thoughte hir beawtye rare did bynde.

This Daymon was prowde, envious, and untrewe,
Faythful to none, butt full of secrett spighte;
A servaunte farre unfitte where he did sue,
His tongue he framed to meritte what he mighte;
Which was with flatterye so fullye charmen,
That none could 'scape, but was by itt muche harmen.

A glorious minde, which made him hated moste,
Full of disdayne, thoughe none more base then he;
Of Venus favour often would he boste,
Who was not worthye her fayer eyes to see:
But longe he did nott in this triumphe dwell,
For Mars his jealowzye beganne to swell.

His wrathe was greate, revenge he soone did take,
Of this boulde gueste, who soughte, like Nero, fame;
He methamorfosed was, for Venus sake,
In water, to delaye his burning flame;
A runninge streame, yett never clensede from yll,
Where vertue ebbes, and mischiefe flowethe styll.

A moddye lake, a sinke of loathsome taste,
A pitte where snaks theire venome moste did hide;
A poysone stronge, to make all goodnes waste
The depthe of vice, that never could be tried:
Wher treason swimes, and all deceipte dothe dwell,
A water, worse than that which leads to hell!
