Hail, high-born virgin, mountain maid!
Hail, Fortitude with adamantine mail,
Who dost the thickest ranks pervade,
Where horrid wounds prevail!
Hail, goddess of undaunted brow!
Firm as the rugged rock art thou,
Which high its head above the billows heaves,
Defies the raging winds, and scorns the rushing waves.

Thee, at a time, when foes on foes
Against Britannia, land of freedom, drive
With naval arms, and hostile prows,
And threaten all alive:
Thee, Fortitude, we one and all
At this alarming crisis, call
Our beating bosoms strongly to inspire
With thy intrepid zeal, and thy heroick fire.

Be present to us, such as when
To Agincourt thou didst great Henry lead,
Together with his martial men:
For still, O warlike maid,
The same perfidious enemies
Attempt to raze our liberties;
The same dire enemies now ride the seas,
To strike some sullen blow against our rights and ease.

Enough is said:  the goddess hears!
The British fleet, a hero at its head,
Large companies of volunteers,
By Fortitude now led,
Ready to meet the foes appear,
Or, if for fight they should draw near,
Ready, bright spirit, under thee to try
The glorious work of war:  to conquer or to die!

So shall posterity, possest
Of liberty and of religion pure,
In grateful memory, attest
What worth did these secure:
While viewing the luxuriant field,
Which shall its happy harvests yield,
Their wives in smiles, their children safe around,
They emulate their sires, and guard the goodly ground.
