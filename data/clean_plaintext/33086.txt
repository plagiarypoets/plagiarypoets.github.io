Faire Ladies, that to Love captived are,
Faire Ladies, that to Love captived are,
Faire &c.
And chast desires doe nourish in your minde,
And, &c. doe nourish in your minde, &c.
Let not her fault your sweet affection marr,
Let not her fault, her fault,
Let &c. your sweet affection marr,
Ne blot the bountie of all Woman kinde,
Woman kinde.  Ne, &c.
Ne blot the bountie of all Woman kinde,
The bountie of all Woman kinde.
