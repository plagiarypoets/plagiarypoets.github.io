Be still, ye winds!  ye restless waves, be still!&mdash;
Yon bark, so lightly tost on ocean swell,
Bears one that wakes the fond parental thrill,
And many a hope and fear, that none can tell.&mdash;
France!  now thy fatal thunders keep ashore!
No merchant-treasure skims the distant deep;
All thou canst gain, for streams of wasted gore,
Are tears, that unoffending parents weep,
And midnight sighs from those, that mournful vigils keep!

Be still, ye winds! &mdash; be still ye waters blue;&mdash;
&mdash;Ye zephyrs, that around the vessel sport!
Mistake the rosy boy for one of you,
And waft him gently to the destin'd port!
An early mariner on life's wide sea,
Six smiling summers scarce have seen him bloom,
He knows not of the cares &mdash; that are to be,
And wonders whence his mother's sorrows come,
And thinks, at coming dawn, again he'll be at home!

At home! &mdash; yes, in those visions fair, unveil'd
By Angel-touch to slumb'ring infant mind,
Oft' shall the scene return, of sportive field,
Of early joys, and recollections kind&mdash;
&mdash;But, through the billows of the northern main,
Scotia!  the little Sailor seeks thy shore!&mdash;
A sterner school, where ruder seasons reign
To brace the vigorous nerve, and classic lore
Shall teach the expanding soul, by virtuous deeds of yore!

Turn then, ye heavens, your angry flashes hence!
E'en brutes, that range untamed the desart wild,
Have bowed before the seraph Innocence,
And smooth'd their fierceness, when an infant smil'd!
To storms the merchant trusts in hope of gain,
But gazes anxious from the beacon-hill;
And now a richer freight is on the main,
And hopes more anxious now the bosom fill.&mdash;
&mdash;Be still, ye rising winds! &mdash; thou heaving deep, be still!
