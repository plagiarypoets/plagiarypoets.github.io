Goddess of the crystal spring!
Quickly haste, and with thee bring
All that brightens gloomy day,
All that makes the seasons gay!
Banish from the circling hours
Cold, and sleet, and wintry show'rs!
Give to lovely Rutland ease,
Who ne'er wants the wish to please!
Clanirckarde's tender frame improve,
Thrice happy in domestic love!
To Mawbey's modest worth impart
Health, to gladden every heart!
On Hamilton thy gifts bestow,
And bid her cheeks with roses glow!
And, tho' hard it be to name
The tender, gentle Ashburnham,
Give her, what surpasses wealth,
Blissful hours, and blooming health!
And happy be the statesman's lot,
(His war and politicks forgot)!
To North again his eye-sight give;
And may he ever chearful live,
Surrounded by the blooming fair,
Devoid of pain, and free from care!
Around thy social table sit,
Delighting all by mirth and wit!
