L  ong may he live, enjoying health and peace,
A  nation's gratitude, with competence,&mdash;
F  avour'd by heaven, may ev'ry trouble cease,
A  nd may he feel all joys of soul and sense;
Y  et come it must &mdash; ah!  be the day far hence,
E  re it be said his mortal sun is set;
T  hen this to him, the blessed consequence,
T  hat while with tears a nation's eyes are wet,
E  nraptur'd angels meet and welcom'd La Fayette.
