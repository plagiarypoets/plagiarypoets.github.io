I know a LAND &mdash; and were it mine again,
I'd kiss the white sands on its graceful shores;
But wide between us rolls the foaming Main,
That round EUROPA'S coasts discordant roars:
I know an ISLE whence FANCY oft explores,
The former scenes of many a blissful day,
Mid bowers of Youth which Memory still adores
Though Youth &mdash; and Joy &mdash; and Peace have flown away!
Yet, wherefore, do I wake my mournful lay,
Or dwell regretful on my ERIN'S smile?&mdash;
Alas!  'tis now, but vain, to sing &mdash; or say:&mdash;
How tedious are the moments of exile!&mdash;
'Tis but the kindred wretch, with kindred cares,
Can know, or tell, how ill an EXILE fares!
