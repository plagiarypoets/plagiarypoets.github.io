Nature at length, as of existence tir'd,
Wakes from her slumber on the champaign drear,
And as sublime as e'er by bard admir'd,
Comes thron'd upon Tornado's dark career;
See Midnight, in the West, her banners rear;
The blood-red Sun looks troubled from the skies;
The distant thunder strikes the list'ning ear;
Joy fires again the once enthusiast's eyes,
As o'er Heav'n's wide expanse chaotic grandeurs rise.

Still onward rolls the volum'd shroud of night,
More awfully in blazing face of day;
Far in its yawning bosom's dim twilight,
Ten thousand vast terrific eddies play:
Such has my fancy pictur'd in dismay,
The hour that brings the world's concluding doom:
Instand annihilation marks its way;
This moment smiles in light yon marble tomb,
And this 'tis wrapp'd from view in night's devouring gloom.
