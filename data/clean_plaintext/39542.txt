LADY TRIFLE.
Bless me, what cards!  but yet I will ask leave.

SIR GEORGE TOWNLY.
Madam, you have it; but I vow I grieve.

LADY TRIFLE.
Di'monds and Hearts; and now I play Spadille.

LADY PRATTLE.
My Lord!  my Basto falls.

LORD MYRTLE.
And my Manille.

LADY PRATTLE.
Were you on Friday at Gallini's ball?
Unluckily I lost my last new Shaul.

LADY TRIFLE.
Your Ladyship will make me lose the vole.

LORD MYRTLE.
There is no danger for you have the whole.

LADY TRIFLE.
When people talk I never can attend.
Sir George, are you my enemy or friend?

SIR GEORGE.
The game is certain, and is ours sans doute.

LADY PRATTLE.
Di'monds to me are an unlucky suit.
At Loo or Whist, I stand a chance to win,
But at Quadrille I never gain a pin.
Sir George!  you deal; I hope the luck will change,
To hold such cards is really very strange.

LORD MYRTLE.
I play in Spades.

LADY PRATTLE.
Was ever such a trial?
But yet at youngest hand there's no denial.

LADY TRIFLE.
My Lord!  your King is trump'd, an omen bad.

LADY PRATTLE.
Upon my word it makes his Lordship sad.

LORD MYRTLE.
Undoubtedly the case is very hard;
I never knew such an unlucky card.

LADY TRIFLE.
Tis just a beast; my Lord, your game must lay.
Now, if you please, we will postpone our play;
For tea and coffee, it is proper time;
To drink it soon like Cits, is poz a crime;
Yet they affect their Routes, and parties quarre,
Concerts and drums; for which I vow I'm sorry.

LADY PRATTLE.
The chat of tea-tables is my delight,
Such repartee abounds, and sense polite;
It really is the magazine of knowledge,
And more improving than a musty College:
With all his sense our Chaplain's such a clown,
I really blush for him when we're in Town;
He talks so loud, makes such an aukward bow,
And enters an assembly, Lord knows how!
And then he is so formal and abstruse.

LORD MYRTLE.
Which, for to say the truth, I think the Deuce!

LADY PRATTLE.
Dear Lady Trifle, have you left off tea?

LADY TRIFLE.
Yes:  I'm so nervous, I can scarcely see;
And have such flutterings, and fits of crying,
That those about me fancy I am dying.

SIR GEORGE.
The country air would make you plump and strong.

LADY TRIFLE.
But when I'm there, the days appear so long.
There's no Society at Trifle Hall,
No gay assembly, but a poor race ball:
The neighbours think they elegantly treat,
If they provide enough to drink and eat:
One knows not what to talk of to such people,
Except their poultry, and their own Church steeple.

LADY PRATTLE.
At Melville Place our life is just the same;
We've no companions, who deserve the name.
Our time is spent in sorting shells and flowers;
We keep such early, antiquated hours.
Then saunter in the groves and dismal park,
Without the hopes of meeting with a spark;
We see the distant view of spires and hills,
And hear the murm'rings of cascades and rills.

LADY TRIFLE.
Our Vicar's wife is quite a downright Joan,
And never pleas'd but when she is alone;
One's so disturb'd too with her squalling brats,
Who scratch and scream like so many wild Cats.
Such scenes as these must rather kill than cure.

SIR GEORGE.
A rural life I never could endure.
To me no transports fields or gardens give;
When I am in them, I exist, not live.
In London, Pleasure wears a vernal bloom,
Which banishes Reflection's painful gloom.

LADY PRATTLE.
Sir George, have you seen Henderson in Lear?

SIR GEORGE.
Yes, and approve him, with a heart sincere.
The house was crowded.

LADY TRIFLE.
Did you like the farce?
Pray has it merit with eclat to pass?

SIR GEORGE.
A petite Piece!  you know the Author's name
Is not the highest in the list of fame.

LADY TRIFLE.
I hear that Captain Flash is gone abroad.

LADY PRATTLE.
I'm not surpriz'd, his fortune was so flaw'd.
That Cap of yours is elegantly gay;
In highest taste, tho' not the least outre.
Were you last night at Lady Squabble's Route?

LADY TRIFLE.
I was too ill to venture safely out.

LADY PRATTLE.
Poor Lady Betty made a shocking figure;
Whene'er I see her she appears grown bigger.
Lord Brag, the new-made Peer, was dress'd en Plume,
And talk'd of pictures, which he bought at Rome;
He'd Di'mond Buckles, and a great Bouquet,
And seem'd delighted, when engag'd in play:
In all mad parties, he is now the man;
Upon my word, it is a wretched plan!

LADY TRIFLE.
He always differ'd little from a fool.
Now, if you please, we will complete our pool:
No mighty matters have been lost or won.
With Tea and Coffee have you really done?
Remove the tea things, John, and stir the fire;
And bring the Indian screen a little nigh'r.

SIR GEORGE.
I could engage to lay some serious bets,
One meets but seldom with such nice quartettes.

LADY PRATTLE.
Good luck we all of us sincerely wish;
When we left off, I think it was cross fish.

LADY TRIFLE.
You force the Ombre, which is very wrong.

SIR GEORGE.
Pardonnez moi, I thought your hand was strong.

LADY TRIFLE.
I hop'd, at least, you had a matadore;
Sir George, we've got the game, can you do more?

SIR GEORGE.
I must be silent, and resign the whole
To you, if you intend to play the vole.

LADY TRIFLE.
I can do nothing; where is the best Spade?
If that had fell, my Queen would then have made.
As the Pool's out, we will reward Manille;
My Lord, here's Basto, and I take Spadille.
I've won but little, yours are trifling losses.

LADY PRATTLE.
When I'm at Cards, I always meet with crosses.
Next Saturday I hope we all shall meet
To hear some Music, in St. James's-Street;
La Motte will regulate, and lead the band;
And Captain Quaver is a clever hand;
Miss Minim too has promis'd to be there,
To sing Duetts, and some Italian Air.

LORD MYRTLE.
Dear Lady Prattle, will you deign to sing?

LADY PRATTLE.
Oh!  name it not!  I can do no such thing;
I cannot reach the compass of a note;
Whene'er I try, it settles in my throat.

LORD MYRTLE.
At least you'll "gently touch the warbling Lyre,"
And with true harmony our hearts inspire.

LADY PRATTLE.
I must go to Lady Flutter's Route;
And call on people, whom I know are out.

LADY TRIFLE.
Why Lady Prattle need you go so soon?
To-morrow in the Park we'll meet at noon.
Sir George, you are engag'd I'll lay a bet;
If you are not, we will begin Piquette.

SIR GEORGE.
Lord Myrtle, and myself, are doom'd to go
To Lord Quintessence, that egregious Beau;
How much more happy should I be with you;
Thus most reluctantly, I say adieu!

LORD MYRTLE.
The call of Friendship I must needs obey,
So graciously receive my last conge!
