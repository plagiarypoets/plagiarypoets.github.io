Awake, my Muse!  awake the lyre!
O, animate the sacred strain!
Let not a thought of earth remain,
To check thy warmth, or damp thy fond desire:
To Virtue all thy strains belong;
'Tis she, bright goddess, claims thy song.
My bosom glows with wild poetic fires:
Fair Virtue's praise I sing; she hears me, and inspires.

Hail, goddess of majestic mien!
I know thee by thy snowy vest,
A flaming sun upon thy breast,
Thy adamantine zone, and brow serene;
I view thee bending o'er some rock,
Undaunted at the mighty shock
Of ruffian waves, that strike the soul with dread,
Or the fell storm that howls and bursts around thy head.

And see!  a heavenly form appears,
Of pious mien, calm and resign'd,
Amidst the tempest-ruling wind,
Of paly hue, and pleasing youthful years;
Who, while the waves the skies deform,
Seems unconcern'd amidst the storm;
With uprais'd eye, on Heaven alone intent,
A smile upon her face of sweetest ravishment.

'Tis Hope divinely fair that smiles;
Oft does she turn the volume o'er,
The guide when time shall be no more,
And points the page that Virtue's pain beguiles:
And, lo!  the storm is hush'd again:
The winds no more deface the main;
The glorious orb of day doth mildly shine,
And Virtue pours the strain, and hails the Power divine.

Mortals, attend the muses song!
On Virtue trust alone for aid:
When under sorrow's baleful shade,
Virtue will bless, and Hope the bliss prolong.
Think that the Power Almighty hears
Your suppliant prayers, and still your fears;
Angels shall minister with fondest love:
Resign'd, then, meet the stroke, and bless the Power above.
