Phillis is both blithe and young;
Of Phillis is my Silver Song;
I love thilk Lass, and in my Heart
She breeds full many a baleful Smart.
Kids, cracknels, with my earliest Fruit,
I give to make her hear my Suit;
When Colin does approach o'erjoy'd,
My Hopes, alas!  are all accoy'd.
Were I not born to love the Maid,
Yet she calls Miracles to her Aid.
When storm Stou'rs had dress'd the year,
In shivering Winters wrathful Chear:
Phillis, that lovely cruel wight,
Found me in a dreerie Plight;
And Snow-balls gently flung at me,
To wake me from my Lethargie.
Fire I ween there was y pent
In all those frozen Balls she sent
For Ah!  woe's me, I felt them burn,
And all my Soul to Flames I turn.
Ah!  Phillis, if you'd quench my Fire,
Burn your self with as fierce Desire.
