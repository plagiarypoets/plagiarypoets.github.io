It is the doom of those who love, and make
Their love a theme for song, to have it heard
By every ear but her's for whom they wake,
And warble, thus, in the night hour of sadness;
To know their raptures many a breast have stirr'd,
Into like paroxysms of doting madness,
And yet could shake not with one softening thrill,
The only bosom they had hopes to fill,
With such fond phrenzy; 'tis their grief and shame,
Still to strike any mark &mdash; save that at which they aim.
