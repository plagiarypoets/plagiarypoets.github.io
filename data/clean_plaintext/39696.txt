Ah leave me, my flocks, and begone;
Far remove from your shepherd and flie!
For alas!  he is lost and undone&mdash;
And alone let him languish and die.
I was proud, cruel Phillis averr'd,
Too fond of myself e'er to please:
And I've hated myself since I heard
Such charges imputed as these.

That my modesty was but a cloak
The affirm'd imperfection to hide;
Affectation she never could brook;
And my silence a mark but of pride:
On these faults she so charmingly dwelt,
Almost I had sworn she was right;
None e'er can describe what I felt,
The grief that she gave and delight.

But with charges like these do not kill,
And do not my silence reprove;
Tho' my tongue, yet my eyes were not still,
And be sure they were talking of love.
Twas diffidence ty'd up my tongue,
Admiration of thee held me mute;
I forgot both my pipe and my song
When I heard thee so sweetly dispute.

None beauty (she said) should e'er prize!
I heard her sweet voice and believ'd;
But I look'd on her face with surprize,
And wonder'd I could be deceiv'd.
Not beauty! &mdash; then Daphne replied,
All hearts should submit to her shrine:
Both appealed to me &mdash; and I sigh'd&mdash;
For Phillis and beauty had mine.

I ne'er could dissemble a smile
When sorrow corroded my heart,
And my tears did not mean to beguile
When from Phillis I wept to depart.
But ah!  what availeth my love,
What avails that I mourn thus and sigh?
Phillis ne'er will my passion approve,
Altho' with that passion I die.

She still will humility brand
With the terms of self-love and of pride;
When my pride's to obey her command,
And to lay my best gifts by her side:&mdash;
Of its sweets I would pillage the plain,
I would strip the fair grove of its bloom;
I would live but her favour to gain,
And depend on her smiles for my doom.
