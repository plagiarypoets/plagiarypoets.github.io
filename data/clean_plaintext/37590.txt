Here rest my breeches on the lap of earth
By Time destroyed, by Pride now cast away;
Whose waistband never knew the stretch of mirth,
Whose lining long ere this had felt decay.

Oft has the needle tried its skill in vain,
Patch over patch full oft their knees have borne,
Oft have their rents my bosom doom'd to pain,
That sympathiz'd with them when they were torn.

Not half so tough the hide of roasted pig,
Not more ambrosial was the damask rose;
Not half so comely was the parson's wig,
As ye my Breeches &mdash; best of all my clothes!

'Till Time's unpitying hand (by fate design'd),
Your stitches, strength, and youth, hath from you borne;
So falls the flow'r before the ruthless wind,
So from its mate the guiltless turtle's torn,

Here, while ye lie upon the teeming earth,
Altho' no shell your funeral pomp displays,
Far from your grave shall fly the rebel Mirth,
And dust and ashes serve instead of bays.
