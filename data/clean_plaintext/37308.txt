Oh!  beauteous flower, of loveliest, purest hue,
Well didst thou suit the bosom of the fair;
In thee the type of innocence we view,
That fragrant flower which blooms for ever there:
Behold, I now transplant thee thence, with care,
With me t' unfold, and shed thy sweet perfume;
And thus may all who Sylvia's converse share,
Bring thence the flower of innocence, whose bloom
Is not, like thine, to meet an early doom,
Nor form'd, like thee, alone to deck our youth,
But shall, in other climes beyond the tomb,
Luxuriant flourish in the rays of truth,
With loveliness and fragrance still combin'd,
Pure as its heavenly source, immortal as the mind.
