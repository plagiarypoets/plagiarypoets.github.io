DICK TRENGETHA.
Fatching hum to Church-town; why, I ben in to Preen.

TOM.
Hast a' fath?  why, what wer't a doing in theare!

DICK.
Thau might'st guess't to the case o't, &mdash; thau knaws't 'tis Preen veare.

TOM.
Noa, fath, then, I didn't; if so be I'd a knaw't,
I'd a striv'd to ha' soald thick ould meare what I gat:
But did'st sang ony moany?  as a body may say:

DICK.
Ay, I fooch'd the rod coaf and white haafer away.
Suchy powerfall tommals of beastes were theare,
One could just e'en scudge room for to stand in the veare.

TOM.
But how mooch did'st a meak of the haafer and caaf?

DICK.
Why, I sould 'em, please zure, for dree guinneas and haaf.

TOM.
Loord!  I think, to my simming, 'twere moaney enow;
But did'st mit as thau com'st array rud and whit cow?

DICK.
Ay, I seed thick cow that thau bostst Vriday ze'nnight,
For fifty oad shillen of un Meagery Bennet;
I saw't as she 'were packing about in the hadge,
Down by uncle Tom Lugg's theare, to Penzenooth bradge.

TOM.
'Tis the crackestest tuad, Dick, that ever thau seed'st;
For sha skeyas about like a thing that's posseast.

DICK.
Teake a pretty thick balsh, Tom, and giv'n a span,
Then let'n jump hadges, so quick as 'a can.

TOM.
Fath, I'll span her, and then, if tha boundries she break,
I'll goa drive her to market, and fell her, next week.&mdash;
But did'st buy any thing when thau wert in tha veare?

DICK.
Arrear Pattick!  dost think I'm come barey from theare?
Why, in marchin's shoap, I bestead to be sure,
In poldavy, and lincloth, five shillens and more.
Besides, I've got vearings and sweetmeats enow,
If so be thou'st a mind, thau sha't; ha' soome to chew,
Dost 'a like 'em wi'em nuts, or zeeds best inside;
For a whoole haaf a pound, I a zure that I buy'd.

TOM.
I think that I'll eat haaf a duzen or soa:
But what hast a seed, be so good's let me  knowa;

DICK.
Why the mounty-bag doctor, what the people do caall,
Got a stanning post up by the maarket houze waall:
And tha man wi' the spicketty jacket was thear,
And he made all the foan of the world in the yeare;
Whiles tanother man play'd 'pon the muzic soa good,
I was verily ready to daance wheare I stood.

TOM.
But did'st buy any mounty-bags vizie or noat?

DICK.
Arrear Pattick!  loke here, see what tommals I goat.
Here's soam for to cure zure lips, and zore eyes;
Thicky theare, in tha bottle, cures ev'ry diseys;
Dism heare in tha paaper cures scaldings and burns;
Thicky green as a lek is to drive away curns.

TOM.
Why, zure I believe thau'st got medzin enow.
I burst some to Trata 'bout dree years ago.
And it cur'd Molly's lang when it wrinkled and swall'd,
And the back of the mule when 'twas cruelly gall'd:
But did Merryman strike up his out-languidge gaames?

DICK.
Ay, he caall'd the poor Dogter a mashes a naames.
And toald suchy hubburld as never was heard,
About on ould fodger that got a grey beard,
And as how that a herse once mistak'd it for hay,
And had like to ha' snapt the ould cheeks o'n away.

TOM.
Coome, 'tis better go wi' me to put hum the cow,
Than to stand post up here just a scabbing a gow.

DICK.
I'd goa with 'a, if I could fittily stay;
But the mules, 'pon my soul, ha'n't ben water'd to day.
This morning I turn'd 'em both into the craft,
May be when tis dark, they'll fall swoomp in a shaf;
'Tis coming all durkish, or else I would stay&mdash;

TOM.
Then I wish the good night, if thou wilt goa away.
