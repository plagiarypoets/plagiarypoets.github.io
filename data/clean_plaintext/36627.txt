What gloomy meditations close the day
That lays our last surviving parent low!
That takes the only barrier away
Which seemed to shield us from the mortal blow!
'Tis sad to be the oldest of one's race,
To see no more of earth the well-known face,
That, with unmixt disinterested glee,
Benignly smiled on our prosperity:
Or like the rainbow gleaming through a shower,
Cold cast a radiance on our darkened hour.
'Tis sad to see Infirmity's stern hand
Wave o'er our trembling heads her withering brand:
To find our limbs grow stiff, rheumatic, ailing,
Sight, touch, and hearing dull, and memory failing.

Yet still, by Providence's kind behest,
Appropriate pleasures on each period rest:
If busy scenes our youthful fancy please,
Age has its benison &mdash; the sense of ease.
Still there are cordials sent in life's decline,
To cheer our progress to the land divine&mdash;
Some fruits late ripening still reserved in store,
Though paler-hued than those we plucked before&mdash;
As flowers at eve exhale their soft perfume.
