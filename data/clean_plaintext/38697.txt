Hail, sober nymph, in cloudy vest bedight!
At thy approach the weary plough-man sings,
As thro' the gloomy lane
He drives his team afield;
When Phoebus joys to rest on Thetis' lap,
Thou gently skimming o'er the misty fields,
Adorn'st with vernal dew
The drooping cowlip's head,
And from the hare-bell call'st the jocund Fayes
To sport in circles o'er the velvet plain;
Soon as thy star appears,
The cawing rooks retire
To the dark grove, and seek their waving nests;
While from yon mould'ring tow'r the grey-ey'd owl
Offers in dismal note,
Her ev'ning orisons;
And the amphibious bat, with piercing shriek,
Flirts round the weary pilgrim's aching head;
On the majestic oak
The chaffer-swarms rejoice;
And from the distant fold the simple bell,
With drowsy tink'ling, soothes the trav'ller's ear:
Now ev'ry passion sleeps;
E'en restless PRIDE subsides;
Corroding ENVY and soul-conqu'ring LOVE,
No longer now distract the human breast,
But all within is peace
And deep serenity.
"Indulgent Ev'ning!  oft may I appear
A wand'ring vot'ry in thy pensive train!"
Do thou unlock the springs
Of HEALTH and POETRY!
