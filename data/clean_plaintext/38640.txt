War!  Nature-shocking, hideous form;
Far grimmer than the Wintry storm!
Thy voice, like fellest Monster's howl,
Harsh &mdash; harrows the recoiling soul;
Th' unnat'ral passions cannot rest,
Which crowd thy admantine breast,
&mdash;That breast, which Pity's pow'r ne'er felt,
Where soft'ning tenderness ne'er dwelt;
Dire Vengeance frowns upon thy brow,
And brooding Anger's redd'ning glow;
Thy baleful eyes with madness stare,
And equal the red lightning's glare;
A blood-stain'd robe, around thee seen,
Augments the horrors of thy mien;
Death, Pain, and Torture form thy train:
And, to increase the dismal scene,
Loud cries and groans the ear assail,
The Widow's moan, and Orphan's wail:
Lank Famine too, and all the woes
Which utmost Misery compose,
With Desolation mark the way,
Where'er thy dreadful footsteps stray.
All Nature shrinks before thy face;
Its ev'ry beauty, ev'ry grace,
And all its blooming glories fade,
And gloom and dreariness succeed.
Ah!  curse and pest of human race!
May Heav'n avert thy rueful face
And hateful looks from BRITAIN'S Isle:
May she with wealth and grandeur smile;
May Commerce float around her shore,
And not the cannon's death-fraught roar;
Then will her SONS, with cheerful voice,
And hearts dilated, glad rejoice,
'Cause Peace extends her Olive Wand,
And scatters Plenty o'er the Land.
