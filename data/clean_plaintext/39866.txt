E'en in the youth and playtime of our days,
There is a death the very living die,
'Tis when its votaries love betrays,
And man beholds his social comforts fly,&mdash;
Each lov'd-one turn with cold averted eye,
Shunn'd by his brethren &mdash; like a stricken deer,
What then shall healing to his heart apply?
What wipe away the constant falling tear?
What &mdash; but the hand of death that lays him on his bier?
