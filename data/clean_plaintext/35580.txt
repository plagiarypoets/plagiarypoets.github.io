Hail, groves belov'd with vernant beauties crown'd,
Where gentle warblers chirp their tales of love;
How joy'd I once to list th' inspring sound,
How 'mid thy sylvan scenes delighted rove?
These shades once lov'd, have lost the charm to move,
'Midst them no more that calm content I find,
In vain for ease I rove from grove to grove,
But love &mdash; th' intruder, love, still lags behind.
The dear idea steals upon my mind,
And bids me fly, for peace to Delia's arms;
Whispers her only gentle, virtuous, kind,
That she alone for me possesses charms.
Some gentle god, these wishes crown,
Else, all my cares in long oblivion drown!
