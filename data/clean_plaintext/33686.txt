Divinest Sex, compos'd of purer Mold!
(We only are the Ore, but you the Gold.)
How shall I justly Treat so vast a Theme,
Where meanly to Commend were to Blaspheme?
How shall I give your Virtues half their due,
In Living Verse, and Numbers worthy you?

Fair Stella, thy soft Sexes Pride and Joy,
The noblest Trophy of the winged Boy:
Bright Charmer of my Soul, whose very Name
Inspires Delight eternal as our Flame.
No longer I'll the noble Task refuse,
If with one gentle Smile you'll Tune my Muse.
The kindly Spring does Natures Face restore,
And dress a new, but Stella can do more;
Where nothing Gay e're flourisht, spite of Fate,
Her powerful Smile can what she please Create.
As, Thebes!  thy wondrous Walls did once aspire
At the command of great Amphion's Lyre.

And now the Inspiration does begin,
I feel, I rising feel the God within,
A kindly Warmth, which does with that agree
When first my charming Conqu'ress wounded me,
(So near a kin are Love and Poetry)
Some Angel has with Nectar toucht my Tongue,
As Spencer's, when his Rosaline he sung.
Snarl on this Age!  the next just praise will give,
And this, as long as the Fair Sex shall live. . . .
