And art thou here again, truth-telling day!
That sent me forth to take my fill of earth;
To pass, as others pass, from grave to gay,
And bear my part in mourning or in mirth?
Come, pause awhile, and give me time to know
If I may bid thee speed, and gaily let thee go.

Thou art no day of mirth, &mdash; though early taught
To hail thy coming as the hour for joy,
Years scarce can check that childishness of thought,
And teach the man no more to be a boy.&mdash;
Thou art no day of mirth, &mdash; for with thee come
Thoughts, grave and high to all &mdash; piercing and keen to some.

Thou art no flatterer! &mdash; faithless friends there be,
Specious and gay, of promise insincere,&mdash;
But on thine honest front at once I see
Thou comest to bring plain tidings to my ear;
And I shall not outlive thee, &mdash; thou wilt be
Fix'd faithful to my fate, and pass away with me!

Then tell thy tale uncheck'd, while life moves on:
And louder yet, and louder be the call!
But, should it sound too often and too long,
Till on a deaden'd ear its warnings fall,
Then may'st thou cease to speak, as I to hear,
And both in silence sleep, till better days appear!
