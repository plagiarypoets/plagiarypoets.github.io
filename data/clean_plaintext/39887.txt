Oh!  goddess of celestial birth,
Thy magic power from heaven extend
To us, thy votaries of earth,
While suppliant at thy shrine we bend,
Grant us thy amaranthine joy,
Let no intruding grief destroy
The happiness that flows from thee,
But every passion bow, and own thy stern decree.

When first thy vast dominion rose
Triumphant in the human breast,
Nor drear Affliction's chilling snows,
Nor fell Despair the mind opprest;
Till unto earth Pandora came,
Avenger of celestial flame,
Stolen from chariots of heaven,
And by Japetus' son to impious mortals given.

But thy sweet influence remains
To cheer us in the gloomy vale,
Where Care with Melancholy reigns
And mortals transient Joy bewail.
The lingering wretch she bids revive,
In expectation's joy to live;
At her command their smiles return,
No more lost happiness to weep, no more to mourn.

Attend then, Mirth, a suppliant's prayer;
Here let thy genial spirit rest;
For us thy genuine beauties wear,
To calm the ocean of the breast.
To thee our hearts we consecrate,
To thy decree consign our fate;
Our hearts to guide at thy command,
Own thy inspiring power, and bow beneath thy hand.
