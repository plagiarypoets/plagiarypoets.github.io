While you, fair Anna, innocently gay,
And free, and open, all reserve disdain;
Where-ever Fancy leads, securely stray,
And conscious of no ill can fear no stain.
Let calm Discretion guide with steady rein,
To friendly Caution lend a patient ear,
She'll tell you, CENSURE lays her wily train,
To blast those beauties which too bright appear.
Ah me!  I view the monster lurking near;
I know her haggard eye, and pois'nous tongue;
She scans your actions with malicious leer,
Eager to wrest, and represent them wrong;
Yet shall your conduct, circumspect and clear,
Her baleful touch, nor fangs envenom'd, fear.
