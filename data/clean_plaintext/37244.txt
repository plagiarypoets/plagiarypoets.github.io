Dear Shade &mdash; if injur'd spirits wander near
The cold couch where their victim forms recline&mdash;
Oh!  come at evening's twilight dim &mdash; and hear
The last farewell!  breathe to thee on thine!
For here I sit, and think at day's decline
On those sweet hours, alas!  for ever gone&mdash;
Ere thou &mdash; so noble once &mdash; did'st first resign
That heart of truth to Passion's thrill alone&mdash;
All lov'd &mdash; and mourn thee, hapless youth, save one!

And she was all to thee &mdash; till thou to her
Wert mockery's sport, so sad and so subdued!
The gift of love she vow'd should never stir
Whence true love planced it on her bosom rude&mdash;
She dash'd with scorn away in wanton mood!
Ungentle conqueror, when the spoil was won
To spurn the broken heart!  'Twas then we view'd
Thy gentleness &mdash; thy reason &mdash; all undone!&mdash;
All mourn, for all did love thee &mdash; all, save one!
