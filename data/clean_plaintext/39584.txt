The death-bell toll'd at midnight, and that bell
Sent sorrow upon England swift and deep;
For on her heart had smote the heavy knell,
And England's tears were those that children weep
In honour o'er a father's final sleep.
But to her spirit solemn memories cling,
For round the bier transcendent visions sweep,
Swelling with patriot pride the heart they wring;
That midnight death-bell toll'd the parting of her King.

That hour the mortal from his pain had flown
To put on immortality &mdash; the shroud
Now wrapt the stately form that filled a throne&mdash;
Time's chilling hand had pressed it, and a cloud
Of anguish on the noble mind had bowed.
He waited for his summons; but the land
Still to his throne the heart's old homage vowed,
Loved with instinctive love the old command,
Honoured the head uncrown'd, and pale, unsceptered hand.

His morning rose in bright tranquility,
And England gloried in the glorious beam;
But storms soon came, and Earth was like a sea
Uptorn by battling winds; War's bloody gleam
Shoots o'er it fiercer than the lightning stream,
Earth's thrones in that wild tumult rush and reel
Like mighty vessels, that thro' every seam
Let death within, while more than thunder-peal,
Or whirlwind, roar around each sweeping, shatter'd keel.

But England's ship, tho' many a sail and shroud
Were from her torn, still proudly stemm'd the tide;
Her banner, towering o'er the wave of blood,
The thunders answer'd from her brazen side,
Till round the noble ship the tempest died,
And round the shore did Earth's rejoicings ring.
But he has past away, her Regal guide
Thro' that wild, glorious day of suffering,
And England by his grave now weeps her Father and her King.
