In Fable's pleasing dress has Spenser shown,
How once ELIZA grac'd the British Throne;
And godlike Prior's bolder lays declare,
A Woman-Chief was master of the war,
And Europe sav'd by ANNA'S arms and pray'r.
But CAROLINA'S Virtues higher soar,
Where never Bard his pinions try'd before;
Her worth who paints must nobler flights pursue,
Than e'er the Mantuan Swan, or Theban knew.
What words, what numbers shall the Poet chuse?
To the high theme where find an equal Muse?
Who for Religion can describe Her care
In scorning Crowns, She knew so well to wear?
In WILLIAM'S bloom her bright Soul appears,
And shine mature in FRED'RIC'S riper years?
Yet while Thy Virtues mock the Muse's art,
Still may she breath the anguish of her heart;
Still let her, gracious Saint, her loss bemoan,
And speak her grief for GEORGE'S widow'd Throne.
While Congreve weeps at MARY'S hallow'd shrine,
Falls no devoted tear to CAROLINE?

"Forbid it, righteous Heav'n!" &mdash; fair Learning said,
(And from her bosom rais'd her drooping head)
"Hither, ye Bards, who boast the pow'rs of verse,
And with a duteous tear bedew Her hearse,
Who bounteous o'er the Learn'd Her favours spread,
The living cherish'd, and rever'd the dead.
Ev'n now, if Spirits blest a moment spare
To make the actions of Mankind their care,
To Learning's Sons Her smiles She still extends,
And what on Earth She lov'd, in Heav'n defends.
Go on, my Sons, and propser in that road
Which urg'd by Her you with success have trod;
Let your free minds purg'd from this earthly clay
Range through the Orbs, where Newton leads the way:
Follow, where Clarke's distinguish'd genius shone,
And to blind Mortals made the Godhead known:
Firm in this hope your too fond grief restrain,
Nor think the Saint less pow'rful than the Queen.
