Harvey, the happy above happiest men
I read:  that sitting like a Looker-on
Of this worldes Stage, doest note with critique pen
The sharpe dislikes of each condition:
And as one carelesse of suspition,
Ne fawnest for the favour of the great:
Ne fearest foolish reprehension
Of faulty men, which daunger to thee threat
But freely doest, or what thee list, entreat,
Like a great Lord of peerelesse liberty:
Lifting the Good up to high Honours seat,
And the Evill damning evermore to dy.
For Life, and Death is in thy doomefull writing:
So thy renowme lives ever by endighting.
