Sun, with Light peculiar shining,
Usher in the smiling Morn,
Round thy Head thy Glories twining
Bid th' auspicious Day be born;
Bid the Hours with nimblest Paces
Free and frolick to advance,
And bid Venus lend her Graces
Tripping at thy Wheels to dance.

Think how swift, when once a Lover,
Skimming o'er the Plains you flew,
When the charming cruel Rover
Bad a God in vain pursue.
Think how deeply you were wounded,
When you stretch'd your eager Arms,
And a lifeless Trunk surrounded
For your Daphne's sprightly Charms.

By the Pains with which you languish'd,
By the Joys you then desir'd,
By the Youth's impatient Anguish
Keen with Expectation fir'd;
Swiftly speed the Heav'ns over,
But that happy Minute rest,
When you see a luckier Lover
By a fairer Daphne blest.
