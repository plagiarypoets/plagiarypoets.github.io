Joyless I seek the solitary scene,
Where dusky Contemplation veils the scene,
The dark retreat (of leafless branches made)
Where sick'ning sorrow wets the yellow'd green.

The darksome ruins of some sacred cell,
Where erst the sons of Superstition trod,
Tott'ring upon the mossy meadow, tell
We better know, but less adore, our God.

Now, as I mournful tread the gloomy cave,
Thro' the wide window (once with myst'ries dight)
The distant forest, and the dark'ned wave
Of the swol'n Avon ravishes my sight.

But see, the thick'ning veil of evening drawn,
The azure changes to a sabled blue,
The rap'tring prospects fly the less'ning lawn,
And nature seems to mourn the dying view.

Self-frighted Fear creeps silent thro' the gloom,
Starts at the rustling leaf, and rolls his eyes;
Aghast with horror, when he views the tomb,
With ev'ry torment of a Hell, he hies&mdash;

The bubbling brooks in plaintive murmurs roll,
The bird of Omen with incessant scream,
To melancholy thoughts awakes the soul,
And lulls the mind to Contemplation's dream.

A dreary stillness brood o'er all the vale,
The clouded Moon emits a feeble glare;
Joyless I seek the darkling hill and dale,
Where'er I wander Sorrow still is there.
