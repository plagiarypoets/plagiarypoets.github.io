No common mind illum'd thy cold remains;
Freedom almost its God!  Wherever men
Had hearts that throbb'd against oppression's chains,
Thine beat with sympathy; thy voice and pen
Would cheer them to the glorious strife, and when
A tyrant triumph'd, or a people fell,
Thy buoyant spirit and pure soul would stem
The tide of fate, with Hope portray'd so well,
That she would linger still where Freedom dar'd not dwell!

Too early for thy country and thy name,
Too early for the hearts you leave behind,
Was thy hard doom.  You lov'd them all, and Fame
Held a proud empire o'er thy glowing mind&mdash;
Now all but that is scatter'd to the wind:
It was immortal, and gave bright presage,
If death had spar'd thee till thy sun declin'd;
Perchance thy name had liv'd from age to age,
Trac'd by the hand of Glory on Time's ample page!

Or hadst thou fall'n as Fancy now beholds,
The green flag floating o'er thy bleeding breast,
Thy glaring eye fix'd on its waving folds,
And shouts of triumph hyming thee to rest&mdash;
With Friendship's victor hand in thy close prest!
This lyre's proud notes to heaven thy praise had thrown,
Rejoicing; that you gave at Fame's behest,
The bauble breath &mdash; for breath, which she alone
Strikes from the patriot's harp in many a cherish'd tone.

But that's a dream &mdash; thy growing hopes, thy years,
Are clos'd forever in the silent grave&mdash;
It has been honour'd &mdash; and will be, by tears
Far dearer to thy soul than all we gave
In worldly sorrow, for the young, the brave.
But oh!  the suffocating sobs that rise
When death has burst the links &mdash; love could not save.
Such hallow'd grief is his from mortal eyes!
Heal'd be the mourner's hearts, and hush'd my own vain sighs.
