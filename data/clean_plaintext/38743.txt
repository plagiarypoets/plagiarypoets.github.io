Ah!  Strephon, your Strains are too gay!
They ill suite the poor tortur'd Mind;
I wish not to see the bright Day,
For Calista has prov'd most unkind.

She despises the Heart she has won,
And laughs at the Pains I endure;
Ah!  Strephon, your Friend is undone,
Since for Love there, alas!  is no Cure.

Yet surely I cannot be blam'd,
Tho' I yielded my Heart up her Prey;
Far and near has her Beauty been fam'd,
And Calista's the Theme of each Lay.

Jove gave to her Figure such Charm,
Of Grandeur and Softness combin'd;
But, oh!  ere I saw that fair Form,
Would to Heaven that I had been blind!

Her Eyes have such Softness and Fire,
As my Pen can never express;
At once they excite soft Desire,
And at once the loose Passion repress.

Ah!  gaze not upon them, ye Swains,
Each Glance wing'd with Poison will fly;
The Goddess will laugh at your Pains,
And despises the Heart breaking Sigh.

From her Lips, Gods!  what Nectar is press'd;
For I their soft Witchcraft have prov'd,
When fondly she lean'd on my Breast,
And swore that like Edwin she lov'd.

But where are your Vows, perjur'd Fair?
And where are the Oaths that you swore?
Alas!  they are melted in Air,
And shall charm the lost Edwin no more!
