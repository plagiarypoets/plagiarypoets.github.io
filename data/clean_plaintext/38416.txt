Pale, haggard Suicide!  thou fell disease!
Thou maniac passion of Misfortune's child!
When ev'ry scene of life has fail'd to please,
And, 'stead of comfort, planted phrenzy wild!
Possess'd by thee the mind of Hope devoid,
With eager rapture clings to fell Despair:
Who, dreadful thought!  presents the glassy tide
Or some vile engine to destroy each care.
Thus far estrang'd from Virtue's flow'ry way,
Contending passions urge the fatal stroke;
Then fell despair, with her tyrannic sway,
Completes a deed thou never canst revoke!
Presumptuous Man!  why unprepar'd thus go,
To meet thy GOD, and fly thy mortal Foe?
