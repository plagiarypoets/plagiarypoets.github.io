Wond'ring at Flights that I despair to reach,
Nor less enamour'd of so various Lays,
As now to Heav'n's Magnificence can stretch,
And all our Senses ravish with amaze!
Anon the Muse some dazzling Spell essays
Her Scotian Vales to gild with unknown Flow'rs
'Till ev'ry Hill reflects the magic Blaze!
Then o'er her Line the welt'ring Wave she pours.
Last, a sweet Moralist, her Skill she tries
To melt, to mend, to humanize the Heart,
With Love, Joy, Harmony, to charm the Wire!
While o'er Those orphan Babes she pours her Sighs.
Aw'd, as at Strain of Druid old, I start,
Nor her own Minstrel, while She sings, require!
