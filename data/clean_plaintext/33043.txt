Erect my Thoughts, direct my Judgement so
That neither, either do misgo, or tire;
And let my Numbers with that fury flow
Which thou alone, in Wisedome, set's on fire;
Make all my Measures meet in Truth intire:
That is in thee (Sole Truth:) for out of Thee
Are nought but Errors Rockes, and Vices Mire,
To wracke al those that travel Truth to see
Without thy Compasse, wherein compasse me.
