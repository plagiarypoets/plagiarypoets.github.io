Oh!  for the lyre of Pindar, to rehearse
Fitly thy praise, divinest Poesy!
Then, might I, in my immelodious verse,
Somewhat pourtray thy gorgeous majesty.
O empress-queen of rare felicity!
'Tis thine, to pour sublime the living lay,
And, borne on glittering Fancy's pinions free,
In emulation of the orb of day,
To gild admiring worlds with Glory's ray;
To make a Chaucer in dark ages shine,
A Spenser, with imagination play,
A Milton beam refulgently divine,
And, high o'er all, a gifted Shakespeare rise,
To melt all hearts, and captivate all eyes.
