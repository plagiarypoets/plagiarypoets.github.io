If I knew man on earth that loved me more,
Or more approved my wayward minstrelsy,
Beshrew my pen, so prone to rhyming lore,
If it should dedicate this Book to thee:
But when I think of all thy truth to me,
And love, though sorely tried, that ne'er gave way,
At once all thoughts of loftier patron flee.
Slight is the gift, for, need I blush to say,
That never song of mine had seen the day,
But for thy friendship, and unchanged regard?
To thee I owe them &mdash; How shall I repay,
My more than brother? &mdash; all thy poor reward
Is this, thy favourite lay, of thy too favoured bard.
