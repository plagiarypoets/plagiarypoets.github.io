Fairest Quarter of the Year,
Absent long &mdash; O re-appear.
Ruthless Stranger to our Isle,
Where hast been this tedious while?
Brooding o'er the Southern Main,
Nursing Oranges in Spain?
Or if in Italian Air,
The Citron Blossom was thy Care,
Thrice the Sun has annual whirl'd
His Car flaming round the World,
And you never ventur'd forth,
Dainty Lady, so far North.

Saw you not the British Swain
Wishful, beck'ning you in vain?
Nor had Ears to his sad Lay,
Chiding your unkind Delay?

But your sober Plea produce,
We admit the Just Excuse:
Wither'd Hag, deform'd and black,
Sullen Winter kept you back,
Ling'ring long her frosty Rear;&mdash;
And by then we hop'd you near;
Summer with her tawny Face,
Had got Possession of the Place.

Thus between two neighb'ring Powers,
Some fair Province lifts her Towers;
Some Silesia tempting lies,
To either Borderer a Prize,

Jostled no more 'twixt Cold and Heat,
Now regain thy ancient Seat,
Nor thy Sister Seasons rude
On thy Right again intrude,
But ever flourish blith and free
Restor'd to thy gay Tetrarchy.

How did Nature sad, forlorn,
Naked in thy Absence mourn?
The wrinkled Earth of Moisture dried,
With Frost and Sun alternate fried,
The tainted Grass forgot to shoot,
The Trees were ignorant of Fruit,
And Ceres shew'd us here and there
A stragling Solitary Ear.

Bless us!  knew you what we felt,
You are gentle and wou'd melt.
Come abroad, o'er Hill and Vale
Floating in a show'ry Gale,
Till thirsty Nature has her Fill,
In big round precious Drops distill.
With encreasing Lamp of Day
Come and smile the Storms away,
Genial Pow'r!  Creating Queen!
Touch the Forest into Green:
Come at length and spread around
Thy broider'd Mantle o'er the Ground.
Come, and ever re-appear,
Fairest Quarter of the Year.
