Blythe Colin, a pretty young Swain,
To court me, walks many a Mile;
I bid him return back again again,
Tho' I wish'd him to stay a great while.
With all by which Love is exprest,
He studies my Heart to beguile;
I wish him Success I protest,
Tho' &mdash; I tell him he'll wait a great while!

He brought me this Nosegay so sweet,
And thought it more Pleasure than Toil;
I took it, reserv'd, and discreet,
But I'll not let him wait a great while:
He begg'd to grant him a Kiss,
So earnest, he made me quite smile;
Have done, I cried, fie!  'tis amiss,
Tho' I wish'd it to last a great while!

He tells me I ought to be kind,
That Time all my Beauties will spoil;
I cross him &mdash; tho' quite of his Mind,
For I love he shou'd talk a great while.
I fancy by what he has said,
My Husband he'll be by his Stile,
And when he once asks me to wed,
Oh!  I'll not let him wait a great while!
