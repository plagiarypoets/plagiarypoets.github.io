Now on her ebon car, in solemn state,
Bland Science leads the lazy-pacing hours,
And the pale crested moon
Beams on the brow of night;
The sky that, braided with etherial pearl,
Op'd its fair bosom to the glow of day,
Now gives its glories up
To still, impervious gloom,
Save where, escap'd the drowsy eye of light,
Soft slumb'ring in the chambers of the West,
A starry, trembling gem,
Peers o'er the curtain'd scene.
Hail!  attributes divine, whose mystic dreams
Stole o'er the Bard, and taught his heav'n-built verse,
In sweet and dying strains,
To tell of Modest Eve!
And Fancy chief, that gave his quill of fire,
Wherewith he trac'd thee thro' thy rapt domain,
Girt with a ruby zone
Of self-created light!
Oh!  lead to Melancholy's hallow'd bower,
Where, wreath'd with poplar, and the cypress sad,
Her slow and measur'd sighs
Float on the dewy breeze!
Or where, in drear Imagination's view,
Stalks the pale ghost across the midnight glade,
And with magnific fear
Chills the benighted swain!
If to the bosom rankling with the wound
Of canker Care, and Love's empoison'd dart,
These scenes may aught avail
To lull my frantic grief.
Whilst in tumultuous strife, my alter'd breast,
Sooth'd by a smile, or heaving with a groan,
Now nurses fair-ey'd Hope,
Now invocates Despair:
For thus to court the theme to sorrow due,
The visions bursting on my raptur'd sense
May grow upon the soul,
And rob it of itself.
