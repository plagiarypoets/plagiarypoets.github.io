To tuneful Ovid, exil'd from his home
Thy sweetest numbers, elegy, we owe&mdash;
Those strains that soften'd his severer doom;
As fancy, to relieve the eye of woe,
Spread o'er his retrospect a vivid glow.
Yet, in his lonely walks, he wont to mourn!
"Ah my poor book (he cries) thou &mdash; thou wilt go,
Without thy master, to the city borne,
Unconscious of thy fate, while here I rove forlorn."

'Tis thus, far banisht from the chosen few
Whose converse once could lull my cares to rest,
Whose friendship brought elysium to my view&mdash;
The harmony that links in love the blest;
Here, in this solitude I sooth my breast
With traces fervid from the muse's pen:
Yet, by the weight of dire ennui opprest,
Tho' my songs "flutter thro' the mouth's of men,"
I hear nor praise, nor blame amid the silent glen.
