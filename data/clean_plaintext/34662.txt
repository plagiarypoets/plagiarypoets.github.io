Far from his coral, wave-encircled, bower,
Form'd for the social, or the festal hour,
Lay sedgy-mantled CAM, on oozy bed;
While the bleak winds beat rudely on his head:
Some silent sorrow prey'd upon his mind,
And o'er his urn he sullenly reclin'd;
That urn where science wont in times of yore,
To trace the symbols of her sacred lore;
Where Freedom once, with virtuous pride elate,
Saw her dear emblems thron'd in social state:
But now their trophies banish'd from its side,
More modern ornaments their place supplied;
Where erst the Genius of the British race
The Charter grasp'd with stern and awful grace,
There smil'd a Peer, whose fortune-favour'd hand
Display'd its power, the staff, the seals, the wand;
Where Phoebus sat, and struck his golden lyre,
In concord sweet with all the Aonian choir;
There Plutus held Preferment's types on high,
Scarfs, mitres, stalls, that prompt the priestly sigh;
Fast by his side was servile Flattery seen,
Known by th' obsequious smile, the cringing mein:
Where Study wont, by taper dim, to toil,
And rifle Learning of her richest spoil,
There Indolence, and Mirth, congenial souls!
Loll'd on the couch, and crown'd the frequent bowls.
At distance due fit objects strike the eye,
Here temples seem with palaces to vie;
A bower umbrageous, a gymnastic green,
Sweet interchange!  compleat th' inchanting scene. . . .
