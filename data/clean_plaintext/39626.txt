Sweet Spring returning twines the annual wreath,
Breathes the soft zephyr and unfolds the flower,
And nature wakes again
The choral voice of joy.

The meadow smiles in renovated green,
The blooming orchard sheds its rich perfume,
And bursting buds renew
The honours of the grove.

The garden now, where art and nature join
Simplicity, and elegance, and taste,
The province of the fair,
Invites the culturing hand.

But most Spring charms where nature reigns alone
In woody wilds, or on the mountain's side,
Where crimson columbines
And purple violets blow.

Now sinks the sun beyond the western hills,
His setting glory tinging all the clouds
With rich and varying hues,
That mock the pencil's power.

Sweet are the charms of Spring, but doubly sweet
When lingering twilight steals upon the day;
When the mild star of eve
Glows in the blue serene.

While falling dews refresh each drooping flower,
And fragrance mingles with the gentle breeze,
Calm Meditation hails
Her still and chosen hour.

She views in blooming nature, nature's GOD,
And, while his bounties meet each raptur'd sense,
She joins her voice in praise
With angels round his throne.
