O for a charm to soothe the poignant grief
Of those that under fell Oppression groan!
O for the power to render them relief,
And overturn Ambition's guilty throne!
Ye hapless Lusitanians!  left to moan
Your banish'd Prince, and feel the galling chain
Of Gallic Tyranny, and bear the tone
Of haughty insult, if ye dare complain!
To rescue you from slavery, and from pain,
That charm would I employ &mdash; that pow'r exert:
But ah!  the philanthropic wish is vain&mdash;
Nothing can now the dreadful doom avert!
That cruel Fate has destin'd you to bear;
And Hope's last gleam is sunk in black despair.
