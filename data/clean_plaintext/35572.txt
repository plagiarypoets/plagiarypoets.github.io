The laughing Amoret may fail to charm
The winning Melicerta cease to please;
The tender Delia wake no soft alarm,
Tho' grac'd with mildness, elegance, and ease;
But that proud port which high Dione bears,
Pourtrays the mind, from earth-born passions free;
And when her haughty head to Heav'n she rears,
She seems to soar above mortality.
For her what numbers waste in hopeless fires!
Yet, Lycon, 'tis not pride exalts the faire:
Her purer thoughts from earth to Heav'n aspires;
Love, and its follies, are not worth her care.
But O, since Heav'n to pity is inclin'd,
Dione must not, cannot, be unkind.

Once on the sand Dione's name I trac'd;
The rising wave soon wash'd that name away;
Again I wrote, again the wave effac'd
The signature of love from prying day.
"Poor youth (she cried) all vainly hast thou strove
To give a mortal immortality:
Alas!  this object of thy tendrest love
She, too, shall sink into obscurity!"
No, my soul's joy!  tho' vulgar beauties fade;
Immortal honours wait Dione's name:
Her Bard, her Damon, sings his angel maid,
And future ages shall record her fame:
Yes!  they shall tell of happy Damon's truth,
Dione's sweetness, sense, and blooming youth.
