Fair was the Night, the Western breeze was still,
The Moonlight slept upon the glossy wave;
When Sappho on the dark o'erhanging Hill,
To the wide air her gentle sorrow gave;
All, &mdash; All was silent as the gloomy grave,
Save when the Seabird dipt its heavy wing
Deep in the dark blue flood beneath, and save,
Its mournful shriek, and Echo's answering:&mdash;
Love thus enforc'd the Maid, &mdash; the beauteous Maid to sing.
