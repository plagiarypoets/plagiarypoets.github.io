While twilight's sober tints pervade the scene,
With shadowy softness; hark!  yon solemn knell,
Death speaking, wafted on the air serene,
With gloomy horror punctuates my mind....

EPITAPH.
Here lies &mdash; beneath this cold unconscious stone
A youth, whose pious life with lustre shone,
A heart &mdash; the shrine of every virtuous thought;
A mind &mdash; with ev'ry graceful talent fraught.
Inspir'd by faith, his trembling hopes arose
To Heaven's dread throne, the balm for earthly woes;
Suppress those tears, subdue those struggling sighs,
Ye faithful friends who sorrowing linger nigh,
And, stranger &mdash; thou his chaste example view.
Resemble him &mdash; then share his raptures too;
Etherial raptures fill his sainted soul;
His heav'nly SIRE'S reward &mdash; his long-sought goal;
Symphonious sounds through Heaven's blue concave rise,
While Angels greet him in his kindred skies.
