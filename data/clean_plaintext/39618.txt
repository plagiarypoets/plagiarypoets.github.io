Awake my muse, awake my lyre,
To highest accents tune my tongue;
With loftiest strains my pen inspire,
For Britain's welfare claims my song.
Each loyal heart, each gen'rous breast,
Will here in raptures join my theme;
Impatient wait heav'n's high behest,
And all with great expectance teem.
Our country now demands our zeal,
And each true Briton's heart bears for the public weal.

When deep insidious plots are laid,
Our constitution to o'erthrow;
And hirelings base, by villains paid
To strike the dire, destructive blow:
What English bosom beat serene!
When dangers hover o'er the land,
And menace e'en our king and queen.
Let all at such a time unite,
Consult their country's good, or in her battles fight.

Now let the base, the coward mind,
It's humble useless station plead;
In shades of darkness lie reclin'd,
Or to the walls of safety speed.
But true nobility of soul
Will here assert it's native right;
Will ev'ry pers'nal fear controul,
And rise to valour's noblest height:
Will teach us how to brave the squall,
Great Britain's glory save; or perish in her fall.

Even our weak defenceless sex
Our loyal zeal may now display;
Nor sword we use, for battle axe;
We fight not, but we sure can pray.
Ye British fair your voices join,
And heaven with one accord invoke,
To aid us with an arm divine,
And shield us from th' impending stroke.
Thus we our country they secure,
And tho' unarm'd ourselves, a higher guard procure.

For me, my tongue to racks shall yield,
Ere it shall speak against my King;
The hand with which this pen I wield,
Fast to my side shall useless cling,
Ere force or art, reward or power,
Shall teach it to oppose the laws;
Turn traytor in the dang'rous hour,
Or coward like desert the cause.
Tho' weak my arm, my heart bears high,
And to preserve my country, I would proudly die.
