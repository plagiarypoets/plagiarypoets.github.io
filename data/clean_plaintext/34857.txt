Be farre, O farre from me the forged show,
The vaunted vanity of lofty life;
But give me the calm peace of lovely low,
From envy shelter'd, and remov'd from strife!
Let my small barke, unequal to sustaine
The rough sea's toylsome paine,
With tempests deadly dangeroust ytost,
And foul with wrecks, the shelt'ring harbor gaine,
Or ride securely near the rockless coast:
No marchant she, cunning in tradefull sleight
To vend her simple freight;
That simple freight sweet heav'n enfortunize!
My wealthfull peace may no rude stour emmove;
Oh save what, more than misers gold, I prize,
Oh save my innocence, and save my love!
