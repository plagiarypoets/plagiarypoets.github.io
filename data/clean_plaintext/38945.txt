Rest from your race of glory!  sleep in peace,
Monarchs of other days!  Thou, hallow'd shrine,
Let not Oblivion's hand these Reliques seize,
These holier Reliques of the Briton-line.

Rest!  O ye Monarchs of the Western main,
That won the laurel, and that wore the plume:
O rest!  'till God's own harbinger again
Shall rouze the sacred tenant of the tomb.

Here fell the grave, the gay, firm friends and foes,
Soft virgins charms that merited the tear;
Here sleep the sages, and the saints repose;
Here rests the martyr, and the monarch here.

Yet, what remains to mark a Monarch's frame?
The crumbling features of the mimic bust;
The rough, rude records of sepulchral Fame,
Earth, giv'n to earth, and into dust the dust!

Are these the trophies of the Kings of Men?
These the sole records of the sons of war?
The artist's chizzel, or historian's pen,
The frail memorial, and the sculptur'd car?

Claims but the patriot, who his life-blood lost,
The cold rewards of monumental praise?
Or does the Prince, or Prelate, idly boast
The Mitre's radiance, and Tiara's blaze?

Does the lorn lover in the gloomy fane
Court the cold busto in the cloister'd shade?
Or woo, with anguish, and complainings vain,
Th' ungenial bosom of the marble maid?

Say, does the martyr, that can bleed no more,
But in those brief and narrow confines lie?
Or is the Saints' high, delegated pow'r
But mould'ring dust, and frail anatomy?

Saints, whose warm embers 'gainst Heav'n's Chancery hurl'd,
Bow'd the meek head, and bent the suppliant knee,
Died, &mdash; like the Saviour of a sinking world,
And, "sunk in silent agony," for thee!
