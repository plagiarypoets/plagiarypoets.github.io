Here too a gentle Lass was sometimes seen,
Fair as the Hawthorn-Flow'r in bloom of May;
Who, tho' sage Pallas was her rightful Queen,
Yet oft at Idless' shrine would homage pay,
And loit'ring wast the livelong Hour away:
Her books and pen the while were thrown aside,
And rich Instruction all suspended lay.
Nathless, so meek and patient was her guide,
In vain he strove to frown and could as little chide.
