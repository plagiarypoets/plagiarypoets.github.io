Poets Laureate, on whose sacred browes
Flourish Garlands of ne're fading boughes,
Whose sweete layes more delicious beene,
Then Philomels or Paphos Queenes;
Helicon is yours, and though that I,
Cannot up to the heavenly numbers flye,
Yet faine I doe admire you, and
Ee'n beg this boone at Phoebus hand,
To rest where in th' Elisian plaines,
Faire fields, I may heare your sweete straines,
Our Ennius, Chaucer, with old Line,
Or Opheus, where, Sidney devine
Sits with Musaeus; Johnson, Spencer,
Drayton, Daniel, English Horace, Homer,
Maro, Ovid; so sing 'twould inspire,
My dull Muse with deviner fire.
Or if not; but with Eccho dombe,
Her Cradle needs must be her tombe,
Then sing her Requiem, much fam'd Cells,
Pyndus, Tempe, Troy, and Thames farewell.
