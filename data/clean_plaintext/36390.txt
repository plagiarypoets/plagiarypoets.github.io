Where, among female worthies, shall we trace
Such illustrations of the human race,
As to the names of Chaucer do belong,
Who, in a period rude, prossess'd the soul of song;
Shakespeare, unrivall'd, with his wond'rous strain,
Who, as archangels over angels reign,
Sits, over other poets, in high station,
Prince of the bards, not only of his nation,
But of the bards of every every age and clime,
Pathetic as he is, and all-sublime,
Dramatic, fancy-fir'd, and wit-imbued,
And tho', with all these powers, with sterling sense endued;
Browne, lost in maze of thought, and Taylor, beautiful,
While, to his mother-church, a son most dutiful;
Locke, on the intellect, who shines so greatly;
Addison elegant, and Johnson stately;
Hume, deeply thinking Gibbon the illum'd;
Byron the stern, and Moore by fancy plum'd;
Cervantes, who array'd La Mancha's knight,
To put declining Chivalry to flight;
Montaigne, who deeply search'd the human mind
With piercing thought, in era unrefin'd;
Wieland, the glory of the German Muse,
To whom th' enlighten'd can no fame refuse;
Tasso, who freed Jerusalem again,
And made its chief immortal in his strain;
And Ariosto, whose romantic lore
Supplied our Spenser with bright wings to soar?
