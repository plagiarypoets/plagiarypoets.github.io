Ye shepherds so blithsome and gay,
That pip'd and that danc'd on the mead,
No longer ye pipe and ye play,&mdash;
Your favourite Cunningham's dead.

Ye lambkins that skip o'er the plain,
Ye warblers that sing in the grove,
You endeavour to please, but in vain&mdash;
How vain are your efforts to move!

By the side of my Cunningham's hearse,
I've planted the laurel and bays;
No poet could equal his verse,
So artless, so soft, were his lays.

How oft o'er thy tomb have I sigh'd,
Of men and of poets thou best!
Like thee would 'twere said I had died,
As happy as thee, and as blest!

Oh!  Cunningham, ceaseless I'll mourn,
At thy loss I shall ever repine;
My tears shall besprinkle thy urn,
Till my breast be as frozen as thine.
