Not for thy crabbed state-creed, wayward wight,
Thy noble lineage, nor thy virtues high,
(God bless the mark!)  do I this homage plight;
No &mdash; 'tis thy bold and native energy;
Thy soul that dares each bound to overfly,
Ranging through Nature on erratic wing&mdash;
These do I honour &mdash; an would fondly try
With thee a wild aerial strain to sing:
Then, O!  round Shepherd's head thy charmed mantle fling.
