When Summer's past, and Sol more faintly shines,
And Ceres' Gifts no longer crown the Fields;
The Sportsman quits his bed
To rove o'er dewy Plains.

His Pointer, skill'd to spring the latent Game,
Betrays the plumy, inoffensive Race;
While round the Field he hies,
And snuffs the tainted Gales.

The Lark, sweet Herald of the purple Morn,
That soars, exulting, in his fleecy Clouds,
Soon hears the thund'ring Gun,
Or feels the leaden Wound.

Hopping from Spray to Spray the warbling Thrush,
Or cooing Dove, receives the cruel Shot:
Nor Innocence, nor Song,
Can ward the fatal Blow.

Nor does the Pheasant, with his beauteous Crest,
His purple Head, and finely-chequer'd Wings,
Escape the direful Tube,
But flutt'ring falls and dies.

What can the Partridge, harmless Bird!  have done,
To bear the annual Hate of ruthless Men?
Oh!  stop your murd'ring Hands,
And shield the helpless Breed.

So shall blest Safety dwell within yon Walls,
Each Field shall flourish with a copious Crop,
And ev'ry Vale shall ring
With Music's pleasing Sound!

But, ah!  how vain and impotent the Pray'r!
Since free-born Britons o'er the watry World
Transport their hardy Sons,
To wage a Civil War.

Yet soon may Peace resume her Olive Branch,
And Mars be banish'd from our foreign Climes,
Whom nought so much delights,
As implements of War.

Dread Slaughter, horrid Shrieks and Cannon's Roar,
The Trumpet's Clangor, and the Din of Arms,
Intestine Hate and Broils,
And Vallies drench'd with Blood!
