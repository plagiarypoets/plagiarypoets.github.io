Spirit of Beauty!  were it not for thee,
I would not gaze one hour on Nature's face,
How great so'er her wondrous works might be;
Nor yet desire to traverse boundless space,
Exploring all things, wheresoe'er a trace
Of wisdom, power, or goodness, meets the eye.
Thou hold'st the universe in thy embrace!&mdash;
The rolling earth! &mdash; the burning spheres on high!
And all those worlds of light that wander through the sky.

Spirit of Beauty!  in a foreign land,
I've seen thee mingle with the noontide sun,
And o'er both earth and ocean wave thy hand;
And when that glorious orb its course had run,
And night's more silent, solemn reign begun,
I've seen thee with the pale moon mount the skies,
As if mankind, and earth, thou might'st to shun,
So high in azure heaven thou seem'st to rise;
But back again thou cam'st to dwell in woman's eyes!

Spirit of Beauty!  may thou still prevail,
And o'er both Time and Ruin keep thy sway!
Though man's divinest works these may assail,
And with defacing fingers work decay,
Thou hast a power more mighty yet than they&mdash;
Pervading nature, and enlivening all;&mdash;
Thou mak'st more beautiful the ruins grey
Than princely palace, with its stately hall;
Witness the ivy'd tower, the garland-cover'd wall.

Spirit of Beauty!  Woman's lovely form
Is thy fit temple, and thy fairest shrine;
Thou mayst take shelter there 'mid every storm
That darkens o'er this earth, no more divine.
Although in worlds above thy light may shine,
The brightness that thou giv'st to woman's eyes
Eclipseth all those heavenly orbs of thine;
To view the radiant soul that in them lies,
'Tis said that angels have been known to leave the skies.
