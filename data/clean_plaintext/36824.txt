Companion of my calmest, happiest hours,
Dear partner of my homefelt joys and cares,
For thee to Heaven my soul in secret pours
Its glad thanksgivings and incessant prayers.
Thou art my world!  What once to me were snares
Wealth, Emulation, Fame, are now disarm'd;
But Love's light yoke my heart contented bears;
By pleasing conjugal enchantment charm'd,
And only by the fear of future loss alarm'd.

When travelling far, &mdash; in sickness, or in grief,&mdash;
Of strangers weary, &mdash; lonely and deprest,
The thought of thee administers relief;
The progress homeward soothes my heart to rest;
Arriving &mdash; I am unutterably blest;&mdash;
Thy tender welcome banishes all care;
Pain, sickness, sorrow, leave my lighten'd heart;
Peace, confidence, and joy re-enter there;
All things appear transform'd; all good, serene and fair.

While conquerors climb the summits of renown,
O'er mounds of dead, thro' slaughter, flood and flame,
And from their stormy eminences frown
On half the wasted world; while others aim
At office, riches, or a titled name;
Our choice be love, and meek domestic peace,
And labouring faith, and conscience void of blame;&mdash;
Joys that may grow when health and strength decrease,
And in full vigour last when selfish pleasures cease.

Oft bows my soul before the Saviour's throne,
Its prayer, "Me from idolatry defend,
And keep, O jealous God!  My heart thine own:&mdash;
Yet still thy dearest, dangerous boon, O lend:&mdash;
Spare her thou gavest till my sojourn end:
Instruct our babe thy saving truth to know;
Let Thy pure influence on our hearts descend;
Our spirits purge from love of things below;
Our strength in weakness be, our bliss in worldly woe."

While God upholds us in this dying world,
The cares of love shall be our sweet employ:
When Death's dark standard, in our view unfurl'd,
Demands the close of our terrestrial joy,
Despair shall not our parting hour annoy:
Hope, strong, exultant, shall the mourner cheer:
Through Him who died, that he might death destroy,
Our mingled dust the Archangel's call shall hear,
And live in love and joy through Heaven's eternal year.
