I may not reach mine hand to yonder shell,
Where its high harmonies suspended sleep
On Albion's votive shrine; I may not swell
The glory of its concave's echoing sweep;
Till, borne upon her memory dear and deep,
PITT'S honour'd name hath worked the expectant string.
It is a name, whereon the virtues weep;
Which the proud patriot muse delights to sing;
As mingles with her lay its lofty triumphing.

Thou wert no longer with us! &mdash; but thy spirit
Breathed in our heart and battled on our arm:
And still thy grateful Albion doth inherit
Its pow'r resistless, and its mighty charm.
Even in the perilous time, in that alarm,
When foreign envy banded for her doom,
And fear domestic quailed before the storm,
They sun-bright genius burst the gathered gloom;&mdash;
We heard its wakening voice, and felt it from the tomb.

Spirit revered and sorrowed! &mdash; thou, whose care
Slept not on Albion's doubtful destiny!
Albion, thy living charge, thy dying prayer,
To her consummate glory asks thine eye.
Bend from thy blessed immortality,
And in their prosperous course her sons assure:&mdash;
For they have watch'd thy word &mdash; how faithfully!&mdash;
And always shall thy counsels, wise and pure,
Avenge their suffering past, their future peace secure!

Oh when our wrath o'ertook the recreant Gaul,
And dashed him forth to exile and to shame,
When, seated on yon guilty capital,
Firm CASTLEREAGH pronounced our victor claim;
Thought we not then of PITT'S inspiring name?&mdash;
In that proud hour, which Providence hath given,
To join the pupil with the master's fame,
Back on its source we saw the tempest driven,
And his last prayer fulfill'd &mdash; "OH SAVE MY COUNTRY, HEAVEN!"
