O for an Angel's voice to swell the theme,
That distant worlds might bend the listening ear!
A Seraph's lyre to wake Devotion's flame,
And warm to Heaven the grateful incense bear!
Scatters the cloud at last, in darkness drear,
That wrapt the destinies of half the world,
Mercy descending dries the bloody tear,
The flag of Truth is broad to Heaven unfurl'd,
And from his murky throne th' oppressor grim is hurl'd.

Man, demonised, no more at will shall shake
Bambarra's wilds, or Niger's reedy shores;
Nor shall the Gambia's weeping Genius quake
Beneath the dashing of the white man's oars.
For Justice arm'd, with eagle eye explores
The tracts where licens'd murder us'd to roam,
The fervid soil redundant plenty pours&mdash;
Science a ready plans the peaceful home,
Where mild affection's flow'rs for ages rich may bloom.

What though the seed, an handful in the earth,
Lonely afar by feeble hands be sown,
Like trees of Lebanon it shall spring forth,
And prosperous fruit the holy act shall crown.
On yonder cliffs, where huge, with sullen frown
The tempest shook the daring Gama's breast,
A little cloud of heavenly dew sent down,
Begins with balmy influence to rest,
And cheer'd for many a mile, smiles gay th' expectant waste.

Barca's dry sands, and thirsty Zaara drear
Of Bethle'm's stream shall drink.  The soothing sound
The mountains of the Moon shall stoop to hear,
And Atlas smile, with leafy verdure crown'd.
Then WILBERFORCE, thy name shall far be found
Embalm'd with Prophets and Apostles old,
While grateful Africa, the world around,
The sacred flag of freedom shall unfold,
Where high Britannia's name emblazon'd flames in gold.
