Sleep, lovely babe!  I love to see thee sleep
In infant innocence serenely there;
No sins of thine have made thy soft eye weep,
And thou art pure as angel seraphs are:
But soon, oh!  soon, in sorrow's thorny way
Shall thy young heart and tender footsteps stray.

Sleep, lovely babe!  blest stranger to our sphere,
May no rude hand e'er break thy peaceful rest:
And may that sun, which smiles upon thee here,
In life's last moments be to thee more blest,
Since life, and youth, and pleasure's airy dream
Are but the shadow of the morning beam.

Sleep, lovely babe!  for soon thy heart shall know
The joyless hours which other days will bring,
When thy bright morning hides its hallow'd glow,
And life's cold winter wastes the sweets of spring:
Then dreaming on, thy cradled songs no more
Shall soothe thy aching heart, as once in days of yore.

Sleep, tender babe!  while on thy lovely face
A mother's watchful eye delights to dwell,
And there thy smiling innocence to trace
While the young heart oft heaves with many a swell;
Sleep, tender babe!  nor startle from that sleep,
For thy fond mother wakes with thee to smile or weep.

Sleep, tender babe!  if after years are thine,
And thou shouldst look on misery, like me,
Which tells thee what thou wert &mdash; but ne'er canst be;
And trace with fancy's aid th' unbroken line,
Then will the tear, as on thy pillow shed,
Awake the dream of life, a dream forever fled.
