SHEPHERD.
Why, Gorbo, as thou cam'st this way,
By yonder little hill,
Or thro' the vale as thou didst stray,
Didst see my Daffadil?
She's in a frock of Lincoln green,
In green, the maid's delight;
No bloom in May so fresh is seen,
No lily e'er so white.
Than roses richer to behold,
That dress up lovers bow'rs;
The pansy, and the marigold,
Are Phoebus' paramours.

GORBO.
Thou well describ'st the Daffadil;
It is not full an hour,
Since at the spring, by yonder hill,
I saw that dainty flower.

SHEPHERD.
My flower, Gorbo, didst thou meet?
And tidings dost thou bring?
Mine's fairer, Gorbo, and more sweet,
Than that by yonder spring.

GORBO.
I saw a shepherd that does keep
Where ouses out the rill,
A-making, as he fed his sheep,
A wreath all Daffadil.
And down the glade as I did pass,
Descending from the hill,
I met a dainty smiling lass,
They call her Daffadil.
The shepherds all were passing by,
Just then, I wist, did stop and cry,
There goes sweet Daffadil.

SHEPHERD.
Ay, Gorbo, now with mirth and joy
My heart thou dost fulfil;
And all the shepherds they did cry,
There goes sweet Daffadil.
