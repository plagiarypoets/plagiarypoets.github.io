CANTO I.
In days of yore, when 'twas the fashion
For folks to grow Fourscore miles, or so;
And Fairies, too, as small as peas,
Uglets, and Drolls, and Elves, and Sprites,
And Good-for-naughts,
Abode on earth, and danced at nights
Round trees;
When Witches, Goblins, Hobs, and make-afeards,
Were as abundant as men's beards,
And when&mdash;
'Twas in those times, I've heard,
Th' affair, subject of these my rhymes, occurr'd.
O ye that love sublime and fulgent truths,
Ye blue-eyed damsels and ye black-hair'd youths,
Attention, &mdash; oh attention pay,
A story like to this ye hear not every day.

In the city
Of Montototobigginnigginous,
(So 'tis writ
In the MS.)
I leave to the learned ones, and witty,
To point out where 'twas sit-
Uate, there dwelt a steeple-tall-as family,
Papa, mamma, and only son
And heir at law,
Ycleped Mister Gorgonammillie,
Mistress Dollydun,
And Master Chincumchaw.
The father carried on the trade
Of pastry-cook,
And pates, puffs, and puddings, made,
Cakes, kisses, trifles, creams, and jellies,
Meet for the bellies
Of any modern noble lord or duke.
He was a merry, pleasant, sugar-lipped gi
Ant, one that wouldn't harm a fly;
And she &mdash; (I mean his wife)&mdash;
"The apple of his eye"
And blessing of his life,&mdash;
Albeit of her left leg a little matter lame&mdash;
A truly house-well-managing and worthy dame.

This happy pair, as said before,
Of issue male
Had one,
The golden-headed Chincumchaw,
The hero of my tale.

"He was his parents' sole delight,"
His welfare was their morning's pray'r,
His happiness, their mid-day care,
His good, their dream by night.
Oh great and glittering were their hopes!
More sheeny than an embryo pope's,
Certes more worthy of excuse:
And thus, as 'fore
Their cottage-door
They peaceful sat,
They'd sometimes fondly muse,
And speculate.

"Ah, by that mole upon his pretty pate,
As sure as fate,
Our darling's destin'd to be something great;
A strawbander, mayhap, or prince, or king,
Or thingabob of state,
Or some such thing.

"Then will he have a palace &mdash; keep a court&mdash;
A buggy &mdash; soldiers fifty-three, and music band,
He'll drink of wine, the best that can be bought,
And eat of meat, the fattest in the land."

"And then he'll go a-wooing," quoth the dame;
But what she farther said
Methinks 'twould be impertinent to tell,
Since every mamma hath thought or said the same,
Down from old mother Eve to yonder malkin Nell.&mdash;

These are sweet thoughts &mdash; delicious meditations!
Bright gleams of sunshine 'midst an April shower;
What though they be but idle cogitations,
As vain and empty as an air-built tower,
Yet&mdash;
The time arriv'd when Chin was sent to school,
Under the sappy-ent Doctor Flogenough,
To learn his letters,
The sciences and arts,
And such like stuff:
As were his betters,
(I mean in quality, but not in parts,)
For Chin, his mother said, was not a fool,
Nor do I think he was.

Yet this deficiency of birth
Proved unto Chincumchaw,
As 't has to many a youth of worth,
A big confounded bore;
And made him (bless us!) often curse the Fates:
For soon he found that school-master and mates
Turn'd up their noses at, and used him, Sir,
As if he'd been a short-tail'd cur,
Or dirt, or mud, or clay!
And form'd from different materials than they.
Helas!  quelle folie.&mdash;
At first (blush at thy works, O naughty Pride!)
Poor Chinny pined away, and almost died
Of melancholy:
But soon discovering that grief
Had not the nutriment of beef,
And would not make him any fatter;
Why&mdash;
He philosophised
Upon the matter,
And in turn (oh fie!)
D&mdash;n your eyes'd
'Em.

Of course he got less halfpennies than kicks,
And not so much of licorice as licks.
Besides many an ill-look'd name and curse,
But what in my poor thought was worse,
The Pedagogue,
(Without compunction or perplexity,)
Visited the sins
Of all the rest
On Master Chin's
Unlucky bones, but most on his &mdash; convexity,
Until, with sorrow 'tis confess'd,
So striped was he from top to toe,
With black, and blue, and indigo,
And green, and pink, and yellow,
And so disguish'd was every feature,
That he more like a rainbow look'd,
Poor fellow!
Than any human creature.

All this, and credit me a great deal more,
Chinny for some time tamely bore;&mdash;
Guess my masters if he were not sore!
At length
A little wiser grown,
And much improv'd in strength,
And brawn, and bone,
Our hero spherically swore
He would not bear it any more.

So brandishing his mountain fist,
And with a fulminating roar,
The gallant Chincumchaw
Demolish'd in a trice the pedant's nose,
With sundry other articles:  videlicet, two rows
Of double teeth, three ribs, an ear, and seven toes.
Then turning round,
Upon his lesser foes,
He made the air resound
With ohs, and ahs, and fearful groans,
And hums, and hems, and piteous moans,
And pour'd such barrow-loads of whacks,
And smacks,
Upon their good-for-nothing backs,
That had they liv'd till now, od rot 'em!
They would not have forgot 'em.&mdash;
The upshot of this matter was.
Our lion-hearted Chincumchaw,
For having, what is call'd, rebell'd,
Was shewn the door,
In other words &mdash; expell'd.

What pass'd when he arriv'd at home,
For briefness' sake must be omitted;
And yet 'twould fill a glorious bulky tome,
To tell how many tender things were said,
How much our hero's rump was pitied,
What seas on seas of tears were shed!
And how the dame
Wish'd that all pedagogues were knock'd o' the head,
And call'd them every name
She could,
But &mdash; good.

Come we then, now, to that part of my story
In which our hero crown'd his brains wi' glory.
But first 'tis necessary to premise,
That tho' the manufacturer of pies
Did wish (and who could more have had his good at heart)
That Chin should play on life's great stage the honourable part
Of tailoring practitioner;
Yet Chinny up his snout did turn,
And cried he'd sooner roast and burn,
Or perforated be with sixty skewers,
Than follow any trade, even altho' Commissioner
Of Sewers.

His anxious mother inward smiled,
And bless'd her seven stars!
For in her boy she thought she saw,
A second God of War, an infant Mars!&mdash;

Now Chincumchaw walk'd up and down the town
Roaming about, like any butterfly;
Nor thought of aught (the luscious-minded town clown!)
Save dainty breads, and sweeties, &mdash; and for why?
His reason was &mdash; "All else is all my eye."
But soon, too soon, our swallower of tarts
"He felt the fulness of satiety;"
Then hated he his land, its ways and arts,
And shortly told his wish, to foreign parts;
And thus with head erect, and language bold,
(Mark me, he was but twelve years old,)
His firm resolve unto his parents told:&mdash;

"Mine be a lot of broils and strife,
A clarion's too shall glad my ear,
A Sword at side &mdash; in hand knife,
And well-stored wallet at my rear.

"The foe-man, oft beneath my blade,
Shall sputter cries of fear and woe;
Oft shall the rich and proud be made
To blatter out Peccavi, O!

"Then Mother, dear, the blessing give;
And thou, my Sire, thy wishes best."
The old man pray'd belong might live;
The Dame, she press'd him to her breast.

He bade farewell, then, to his Sire's shop,&mdash;
It was a monstrous and most antique booth,
So ag'd and craz'd, it spun round like a top,
When Boreas blew and blustered sans ruth.
A venerable stall!  which once in sooth,
Had been the tenement of obese hogs;
Now, many a school-boy, with sharpen'd tooth,
Was seen to enter &mdash; freed from the harsh clogs
Of discipline, and thoughts concerning him that flogs.

Chin set his travels, then,
With heart both light and free,
And seldom was there seen a youth
Much prettier than he.

And now, before he's gone a mile
Upon his lonesome way,
Methinks upon his form and face
A word or two I'll say.

Then damsels list, and lads be still,
Nor pout your lips for spite,
Whilst I his figure, brave and stout,
Do unto you recite.

He was a proper Childe, and very tall,
'Twas said with one hand he could touch the moon,
Therefore, say I, "rake him for all in all,"
We shall not see his equal very soon;
His face was like Apollo's phiz at noon,
Thatch'd wi' red hair, which hung like twenty mops
(Luxuriant locks!  Nature's bounteous boon)
About his jolly, fat, come-smack-me chops,
Long used to munching sweets and lollipops.

And Chincumchaw &mdash; O Ladies listen!&mdash;
Had two large eyes,
Larger I trow then sixpenny mince-pies,
Or French rolls,
And red as live coals:
With lashes thick as ropes, and long as leaping-poles.
They were sweet eyes, the giant Misses said,
So full of fire!  a glance from them was like
A spike,
Or dart,
Running right through and through your head,
And heart,
And leaving after it &mdash; oh such a pleasing smart!!
His nose!&mdash;
A nose he had, &mdash; ye heavenly Nine!
Sing what a nose had Chincumchaw,
Majestic promontory!  proboscis superfine!
Of beaks the emp'ror, and of snouts pacha.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Its size exceeded twenty tubs,
And 'twas shaped like th' ace of clubs.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

His mouth would have made a chicken stare,
Like Staffa's cavern yawning;
His teeth (oh monstrous!) seemed stuck there,
Like mile-stones, to give warning.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

His beard resembled a tall oak tree,
And foxes and polecats, and birds of prey,
And rats and mice, black, white, and grey,
Nestled to it, sans ceremonie.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

It does not come within my plan,
This extraordinary man
To follow
Thro' all his 'ventures and mischances;
For were I to relate but half
His weary jigs, and jumps, and dances,
I should not finish by to-morrow.

He pass'd thro' many states and climes,
Gath'ring improvement as he went along,
Checking the viciousnesses of the times,
And doing feats that shone in many a song.

In Russia, it was said he learned to skate;
In Spain, to walk with majesty and state;
In France,
To bow his head, kiss, dance,
And nonsense prate:
In Holland he was taught to smoke and stink;
At Rome to think;
In Albion to box, and swallow luscious drink;
And in Allemagne convers'd almost
Three days and three nights with a pig-tail'd ghost.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

He physic'd five and forty Doctors,
Hang'd sixty-eight Solicitors,
As many Proctors,
Together with a score or more of other visitors
Of courts;
And from life's page scratch'd out old juggling lords,
Usurers, bullies, thieves, cheats and bawds,
As if they'd been so many oughts.
Nay more:
'Twas said, that three or four
Certain great men, who clothe their skills in ermine,
Were by our hero knock'd o' the head,
Or otherwise extinguished,
Besides a quantity of other vermin.
In fact, the age did teem with songs
Relating to this punisher of wrongs,
From one of which,
To shew the curious costume of the times,
And give eclat to these my rhymes,
I copy hero a distich:&mdash;

"His helmet was a hollow tooth, pluck'd from
great Musti's skull.  A thousand skins
Of different beasts, tied fast together by the tails,
his shirt compos'd.  Shoes he wore
Thus having travell'd far and wide,
And full of fame, and wealth, and pride,
To home, dear home, our hero hied,
Was welcom'd by Papa; Mamma, and Misses,
With jolly hugs, and hearty kisses.


CANTO II. AND LAST.
But, ah!  it cuts me to the quick to tell
This mighty-knocker-down at last was floor'd,
And by a boy, whom ladies know full well.
Mam Venus' son, &mdash; a wee, tho' potent lord,&mdash;
With bow and quiver plentifully stored.
As David slew the giant of martial fame,
So 'fore Love's dart down fell our hero's sword;
Laugh not, ye naughty folks, nor make ye game,
For everything of flesh vanquish'd hath been the same.

About three quarters of a mile,
(The path was straight and even as could be,
Impedimentless, sans hill, sans stile,
And even sans a tree,)
From our good pastry-cook's, fronting a princely wood,
A tenement or dwelling-house there stood,
The habitation of an aristocrat,
A yellow Ogre, pregnant-pursed and fat;
Now the fair Blobbee, his daughter,
Would have made a very saint's mouth water:
'Twas with this dame (sad source of groans and tears!)
Our hero fell in love, souse over head and ears.

Oh that I had the pen of Tommy Moore,
To tell her lovelinesses o'er and o'er!
Her snow-white tresses, fragrant locks,
Redolent as tail of fox,
Her skinny lips and yellow cheeks,
Her fragrant breath, resembling leeks;
Her eyes like glass of bottle green,
Teeth the bluest that could be seen,
Proboscis half a mile in breadth,
And chin almost a league in length.
With charms like these, and may more too,
What might a Bard like little Tom do?

Our hero lov'd the wench, &mdash; audacious boy
He might as well have lov'd the evening star;
For though the damsel was' not very coy,
A stone was softer hearted than papa,
A harsh-tongued thing; whose kindest word was psha!
An intellectual Sir &mdash; a bloated prig&mdash;
As proud as punch (tho' not peculiar,)
Who boasted his descent from prince Pigwig,
The Empress Whatdyecall, and Royal Thingmajig!!!

But Chin, as shewn, of courage had his share,
And well he knew
The adage true,
A faint heart never won a lady fair.

And so, he sat himself down at her gate,
And heav'd three piteous sighs,
And smote his breast, and scratch'd his pate,
And bless'd the lady's eyes.

Now she (sweet heart!) soon pity took
Upon our son of a pastry-cook,
And thro' her window cried,&mdash;
"Brave knight, no longer hideous groan,
Brave knight my heart is not of stone,
Yet, ah!" &mdash; she blush'd and sigh'd.

With transport now the hero's heart
Leapt in his mighty breast,
And soon as he his lips could part
Thus he the maid address'd:&mdash;

"Light of my eyes, my meat, my food,
The air I breathe, my sleep, my love,
My sun, my moon, my only good,
My bird of Paradise, my dove!

"And dost thou love me?  Oh,
Put me at rest, say 'aye' or 'no,'
Slaughter at once, or for ever bless."
The green-eyed nymph scream'd &mdash; "Yes!"

Cupid from far beheld the scene,
And shook the skies, with laughter,
In which his mother join'd, I ween,
When she saw what he'd been after.

Would now that such a sequel I might tell
As the sweet Jane or Anna love so well,
As how the happy couple went to church&mdash;
Were married &mdash; had children six or seven&mdash;
(Of course weren't sparing with the birch,)
Lived long &mdash; then died, and went to Heav'n;
But having truth before my face,
I cannot say such was the case.

In fact I do most earnestly declare
(And what may come on't I little care)
That Mistress Fortune shew'd such spite
Towards our brave tho' luckless knight,
That if at that time she possess'd
Of milk of kindness in her breast
A little drop, or shower,
The last night's thunder must have turn'd it sour.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Sweet, oh sweet did seem Love's dream,
More dulcet than Damaseen cream;
Yet soon, ah soon was the vision dispell'd!!

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

"Alack!  (Blobbee cried,) thou knowest not
My governor Grim so cruel;
Oh if his nose but smells our plot
He'll put salt in our water-gruel."

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Her Sire it seems, like Pas in Spain,
To keep her la'ship under rein;
To teach her what to do and say
All naughty men to fright away,
For these, and every other reason,
In short, to guard 'gainst petty treason,
Until she changed her condition,
Had placed her under the tuition
Of a far-famed dwarf magician.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Oh, 'twas a filthy morsel; a conglomeration
Of qualities most hideous,
A nasty wretch, a big abomination,
A bag of mischiefs, and of arts insidious,
A compound of deformities,
And vile agglomeration of enormities!!
O reader!  picture to yourself
The figure of this villain elf;.
Conceive, imagine, if you can,
A thing part fish, part brute, part bird, part man,
With bowels of sulphur, brain of fire;
But, lest imagination should expire,
Read, oh read!

Two ass's ears, fearfully long,
Arose like watch-towers from a hairless head;
Beneath, two optics small, obliquely turn'd, and red,
Seem'd only made to guide their owner wrong;
Forth from his tawny cheek,
In lieu of nose,
There branch'd an eagle's beak,
Broken in combat with Awnfog,
The first and deadliest of his foes;
Three long-legg'd teeth, like mountain saws,
Leap'd bent on mischief, from his jaws;
His tongue was like an adder's, fork'd and sharp;
When anger'd he could vomit fire;
For arms he'd fins, like tench or carp,
As had before him Pog, his sire;
The legs of a cat,
The tail of a rat,
And wings of a bat,
Made up this frightful thing;
And of all known monstrosities he was the king.

Such was the guardian of the fair Blobbee;
And vigilant and venomous was he
As the old dragon in fabled history,
That watch'd the golden pippin tree.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

"Aha!  (between his teeth he mutter'd,)
Is the fool such a sheep
As to think that I sleep?
He shall soon see how his bread will be butter'd."

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Accordingly he blew a blast,
A blast long, loud and shrill,
When up before him there did jump
Goblins with the yellow hump,
And Tib and little Bill.

"Now prepare your pincers soon, (quo' he,)
(He spoke wi' a charcoal breath,)
A thousand torments quick devise,
And sport with him here before mine eyes,
Till he supplicate for death."

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

The rascals heard but to obey,
And set up a fearful roar,
Then away they went, on fury bent,
To torture and tease our unlucky gent,
The gallant Chincumchaw.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Now clubs from East and West
And North and South
Attack'd him on his legs and breast,
Back, head, and mouth;
Now did a mouse (long tail'd) nibble his ears and nose,
And now a ponderous hammer smash'd his weeping toes.

Now a warlike, sprightly nation
Of bodkins, needles, thorns and pins,
Took up, with great sang-froid, their station
In poor Chinny's aching shins.

And presently, good lack!
A filthy pack
Of dogs, and apes, and tabbies,
Bark'd, chatter'd, and spat on his bending back.
Chanced he to gape, a stone his teeth punch'd out;
Roar'd he, and fifty voices mock'd him with a shout;
He tried to sleep, a huge hand struck his face,
And up his nostrils three maggots ran a race;
Tried he to sit, a nail rose in his seat;
And at his meals, the shy little wren,
With saucy Bob Redbreast and his hen,
Did snatch from his lips the very meat
He was going to eat.

In short, seated or on his legs, awake or sleeping,
Poor Chin had cause, most mountainous, for weeping.
Thus teas'd and tormented, and vilely abus'd,
Our hero on vengeance eternally mus'd:
He plann'd and be plotted, and plotted again,
To visit with Justice this vilest of men;
But plot as he would, be found it was vain.

At length Mistress Fortune did seem to relent,&mdash;
Alas!  who would trust the blind hussy;
Not I for one, tho' &mdash;
Yet her breath tells ye then she is muzzy.

Now Grim had a habit every day after dinner,
As many a nineteenth-century sinner,
Of taking a nap, &mdash; whether 'twas to digest
The beef he had eaten, or what, he knew best:

Thus sleeping one day, 'neath a tree did he lie,
Shaded 'fore and behind from hornet and fly,
When Chinny, our hero, did chance to pass by.
Joy beam'd in his eyes as he sharpen'd his teeth,
And gazed on his foe, lying dormant beneath,
Thoughts fierce as hot water distracted his breast.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

"If he wakes, (did he hurriedly soliloquize,)
"For ever I lose him, &mdash; the capital prize.
Why pause I?  why stay I?  O marvellous dunce!
I'll swallow the villain of villains at once."

Then taking him up 'tween his finger and thumb,
He gulp'd down the rogue like a pill or a plum.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Soon did the Fay awake:  astonish'd, he,
Instead of mead and grove and shady tree,
To find him seated in a horrid cell,
Darksome and dank, and not of sweetest smell.
A glance around him told him where he was:
His rage I leave to other scribes to write,&mdash;
I cannot do it, and I own 't, that's poz,
Were I to try a whole day and a night.
At first he storm'd and curs'd with all his might,
And gnash'd his teeth and pull'd his hair,
And gnaw'd the little guts for very spite,
Then clim'd him to the lungs to get some air,
And then down sat himself in wild and fierce despair.

Chin, all the while, was happy as a king,
And as he went along
Roar'd full many a song,
Until he made the woods and forests ring.

O luckless youth!  O woeful truth,
That falls to me to tell,&mdash;
Little knew the knave, as he sang the stave,
'Twas his death's knell.

Oh what's the matter &mdash; what's the matter?
What is 't that ails young Chincumchaw?
That thus we hear him fearful blatter,
Blatter, blatter, rave and roar.

At one, or two, or three o'clock,
'Tis all the same to Chincumchaw;
At dead of night, at crow of cock,
Still doth he rave, and roar, roar, roar!

Oh had you seen him writhe, I ween,
Astonish'd you'd have been,
'Twas like Mount Blanc or Derby Peak
Tormented with the spleen.

For now the fiend, with fury mad,
Belch'd forth a cloud of smoke,
Set fire to our hero's lights,
And almost him did choke.

And he, poor fellow, repented him
He'd swallowed such a pill,
And griev'd was he that he did not
The rascal at once kill.

His face grew pale, his eyes did roll,
His massive form did shake,
While down his face too sweat-drops fell,
And his blanched lips did quake.

Oh what's the matter?  what's the matter?
What dread report is that we hear,
That seems Earth's fundament to shatter,
And spreads round horror, grief; and fear?

The ravens croak, the owls do shriek,
The skies with lightnings glare;
Whilst thro' the air fly nose and cheek,
And eyes, teeth, brains, and hair!

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Says Juno, a-laughing, to old Peter Jove,
"I'm struck with a thought, my dear rake,
To our Earth what a very elegant stove
Would yonder phenomenon make."

"Agreed," quoth the god, and he gave a nod
To Mercury, Dame Maia's son,
"And fly, (cried he,) you figure of fun,
And see that your Mistress' will be done,&mdash;
'Twill be a good joke, ecod."

Down, with celerity of Congreve rocket
Or parachute,
Flew the celestial pickpocket,
His chief's commands to execute.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

An awful stillness reign'd around
No bird disturb'd the air, no leaf ev'n rustled on the ground.

Chin's headless' trunk appear'd to swell
To twice its size original;
His legs, united into one,
Sunk into earth, as if to shun
The light of Heav'n's glorious Sun;
His arms &mdash; those arms, his greatest pride!
Retreated into either side;
His flesh, before as lilies white
Quickly became as black as night;
And what was shirt and furbelow,
Was in an instant turn'd to snow.
In fine, the human shape was gone,
And that which formerly was flesh and bone,
And gristle, blood, and beard,
Now a monstrous rock appear'd.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

The flames continued pouring forth
Thro' the wide-mouth'd wound which Grim had made,
And ashes in bushels, brimstone and smoke,
And burning coals.
Oh it did seem, so great was the grumbling,
So fearful the rumbling,
So horrid the mumbling,
In the mountain's internals,
As if all the infernals
From their chains loose had broke,
And were coming in quest of wicked souls.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

And what became of Governor Grim?
Governor Grim the prim,
Governor Grim the cruel?
Did he 'scape from the liver-pool gaol?
O no, &mdash; he was made the maitre-d'hotel,
In the volcano's belly for ever to dwell,
To stir the fire and kick up a pell-mell,&mdash;
And there, good folks all, ends my tale.
