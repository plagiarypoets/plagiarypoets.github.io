How dear to roam along the sunny hills,
When Autumn spreads her bounties on the plain;
When Industry his garner'd treasure fills
With richest stores from fields of ripen'd grain;
When slow across the fields the ponderous wain,
Deep laden with the yellow ears, is drawn,
While from wide trees, that overhand the lane,
The ripe red apples, shaden down at dawn,
Lie scatter'd thick and far along the level lawn.

The winding rill along the sunny vale
Sings its sweet song to cheer the reaper's heart;
And oft its voice the pensive autumn gale
Will join, and cause the rustling leaves to start;
While scores of screaming blackbirds bear their part,
With varied notes, yet full of melody;
And troops of noisy boys, with dog and cart,
Are hasting to the hills with youthful glee,
To shake the clustering nuts from the tall walnut tree.

But soon this beauteous pageantry shall fail,
And every mellow tint of Autumn fade;
A melancholy murmur fills the gale,
And sorrow saddens o'er the yellowing glade;
Through thickening clouds the suns of autumn wade,
And beauty sits upon the hills no more;
The verdure of the wood is prostrate laid,
And soon the autumn rains begin to pour,
And down the craggy rocks the swelling torrents roar.

Such is the fortune of majestic man!
The leaves of fragrance round his forehead flow,
The laureate wreath, that gales of fortune fan,
For which he climbed so high or stooped so low;
But soon approach the tempest clouds of wo,
To mar the beauty of his brightest deed;
Yet while he mourns his fortune's overthrow,
He looks to heaven for some more glorious mead;&mdash;
Thus to the autumn winds I tune my Dorick reed.
