Often with Fancy young the live-long day
By fountain clear my native dales among,
I've wander'd, list'ning to thy plaintive lay,
Divinest Minstrel of that fav'rite throng,
Who breathe, in simple rhyme, enchanting song.
Or, lost in vision wild, or tender thought,
Thro' many a gay romantic scene at morn,
With thee I've hasten'd to the haunt remote
Of Solitude; or heard the hermit's note
'Plaining at eve; or o'er Eliza's urn
Shed the soft tear.  Ah!  could this verse with thine
In beauty, tenderness, or fancy's glow,
Compare; soon should the willing muse entwine
A wreath of laurel round thy honour'd brow.
