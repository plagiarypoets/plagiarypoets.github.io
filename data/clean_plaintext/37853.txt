Hence, livid Envy, murkiest fiend of hell,
Hence, blood-stain'd Malice, to thy baleful cell;
Avaunt, and shed not here your venom'd rage,
Nor with your touch pollute the sacred page;
To MASON the melodious lays belong,
MASON, the soul of genius and of song!

Hail, bard sublime, with raptur'd eyes we see
The soul of Sophocles reviv'd in thee;
Hail, wond'rous youth!  in whose bright strains conspire
Plato's cool judgment, and warm Pindar's fire;
Whilst Homer's grandeur, Virgil's sweetness join,
To make each noble sentiment divine.

What grief, that scenes, which in an earlier age
Had won the wreath on Athen's polish'd stage;
Those scenes produc'd beneath bright learning's throne,
Which Delpho's god without a blush might own;
Those scenes where fire-fraught fancy's strongest ray
Adorns and animates the moral lay;
What grief, that scenes like these, by wayward chance,
Must yield to pantomime, or paultry dance?
While the true Attic elegance and wit,
Dare hope no plaudit from a British pit.

What is th' applause of a theatric crowd!
The breath of folly, by caprice bestow'd.
A soul like thine disdains such trivial praise,
Nor seeks to mount to fame by vulgar ways;
Nobly content with modest merit's due,
The just applause for ever shall be thine,
And thro' all ages thy Elfrida shine;
Elfrida's still shall live with MASON'S name,
Distinguish'd in the brightest rolls of fame.
