Bellair, a Lad, wha spent a hantle time,
In hunting Hares, and making gentle Rhime;
Three Shepherds fand fu waefu and forlorn,
Streek'd a' their length beneath a spreading Thorn.
He speir'd their aliment wi' a melting Heart,
And said he'd strive to cure their cutting smart;
Their cutting smart wi' willing Minds they sung,
In nat'ral Numbers and their Mother Tongue.

WILLIE.
Alas!  quo Willie, gen ye kend my care,
Your Heart wi' Grief I'm sure wead e'en be Sair.
Bessie, my Lass, God kens how wiel I loo'd,
How aft I kist her, and how lang I woo'd,
Has gi'en me o'er, and run awa' wi' Tam.

DAVIE.
What's that, quo Davie, to my dainty Lamb?
A Lamb, the best of a' my feckless Flock,
Was worried yonder on a waefu Rock.

MUNGO.
What silly stuff dings down the Hearts o' some?
A gritter matter gars me greet and gloom.
Our Laird, shame fa' his chafts!  wad no forbear,
'Till he had fleetch'd awa' my pickcle geer.
He gard me trow he'd put in in the Stocks,
And I thro means o' some sly brokeing Fox,
Wad soon grow rich and be a Laird my sell;
Bat a' is lost, and I hae ne'er a Doyt to tell.

WILLIE.
I wonder, Sirs, to see ye hae the Face,
To ev'n your Trifles to my bonny Lass!
Wha use wi' Lambs or Siller to compare,
A precious Saul?&mdash;

DAVID.
Refer it to Bellair,
Gen ye for Bess, or Mungo for his Gowd,
Hae haff sae muckle reason to be dow'd.

MUNGO.
Sae be it &mdash; let Bellair the Case decide,
For he's a Scholard, yet withouten Pride.
But furst let ilk some futhy Wager lay,
That he my get a Prize wha wins the Day,
I, for my part, will stake my branded Ox,
I suffer maist, wha lost my Gowd in Stocks.

WILLIE.
And I will pand this Ring down in his loof,
He will decide the Case in my behoof;
'Tis a' the Gift that e'er my Bessy gae,
I wad na loss't for a' the Nowt ye hae.

DAVIE.
I hae nae Ox nor Ring indeed to stake,
But a' I hae ye sall hae leave to take;
Gen I the Wager loss &mdash; sae sure I am,
My loss is maist, wha lost a dainty Lamb.

BELLAIR.
Your kindness moves me, Shepherds, for your sake,
Gratefu, whate'er I can to undertake.
But first, as Judge, 'tis requisite I know,
The aggravations of your various woe;
Before I can impartial Sentence pass,&mdash;

WILLIE.
Let me speak first, wha lost a bonny Lass:
The grittest Cause shou'd first of a' be heard,
And the best Singer hae the best Reward.

BELLAIR.
Let Mungo first rehearse his mournful Tale,
(For Bubbles more than Lasses now prevail.)
You next, and David last of all reply,&mdash;
The Muses love alternate Melody;
And as a Premium for the Shepherd's Pains,
Who best resembles Ramsay's 'tuneful Strains;
In Burchett's Name, I here engage to give
Twice twenty Crowns, his Courage to revive.

MUNGO.
What sall I say?  I had a hunder Mark,
O' Yellow Gowd, that glitter'd in the Dark;
Lang had it lain in a close cosie Hole,
Abint the Chimly, bigged in a Bole.
Fu safe it lay, 'till Bubbles gan to rise.
O gen I had it back!  I wad be wise.

WILLIE.
I thought safe Bessy mine fu hard and fast,
And that we twae shou'd Married be at last.
But ah!  how aft hae Shepherds soon believ'd,
And by the Queans they trusted, been deceiv'd.

DAVIE.
My Lamb was grown a strang and tyddy Beast,
(The Laird himsell ne'er had a fatter Feast;)
Aft hae I said, whan ony chanc'd to speir,
"How dis you Lamb?  Fu gayly, bra won geer:
But rackless Fate has met it on the Rock,
And I alas!  am quite undone and broke.

MUNGO.
I took our Laird to be an honest Man,
(But they shou'd ne'er be trusted wha can bann.)
And mony a time the Brokers sent me Word,
My hunder Mark wad fetch me hame a Hoord.
Yet, 'mang 'em a', I poor unlucky Lad!
Instead o' gath'ring mair, lost a' I had.

WILLIE.
My Neighbour Tam pretended still to be,
A downright Man and faithfu' Friend to me;
Yet he, fase Carl!  has sae unjustly play'd,
And taen my proper Bessy o'er my Head.
This mixes Wormwood in my Dish, and makes
My very Heart to stand upo' the Rocks.

DAVIE.
Gen ony Tyke, to wham I ne'er was kind,
Had kill'd my Lamb, it wad hae caum'd my Mind.
But Coly, wha I dawted maist was he,
That laid this Lade o' Poverty on me.
Aft hae I patted wi' my Hand his Head,
And frae my Pouch flung down grit dads o' Bread,
And he, fu gratefu, us'd to wag his Tail,
Bark'd whan I bade, and did my Business hale.
But now, vile Cur!  he sair'd me sae at last,
For a' my Love and Kindness to his past.
Let ne'er a Shepherd trust his Dog again&mdash;

MUNGO.
It wad hae saft'ned a' my inward Pain,
And lang e'er now I'd gi'en my mourning o'er,
Gen they had said they wad my Gowd restore.
But wha can bear wi' Patience to be robb'd?
Baith out o' Stock and Int'rest slyly jobb'd?
As soon sall Frost congeal the rumbling Sea,
As I thae Rogues, that sham'd me sae, forgie.

WILLIE.
Gen Bessy had na Sworn and Sworn again,
That she ne'er loo'd sae wiel anither Swain;
And that the Sea shou'd sooner cease to roar,
Than she prove fase, and gie her Willie o'er;
I cou'd hae born wi' gritter ease my grief,
And drunk in ilka drap o' sweet relief.

DAVIE.
How foolish is it for an honest Clown,
To trust a Tyke, whan he's greay Bearded grown?
Coly, whan Young, unpractis'd in Deceit,
Was ay, good natur'd, and ne'er prov'd a Cheat.
Aft a' my Flocks I trusted to his Care,
And thought I mught do sae for evermair.
But, like a Court-Man, he betray'd his Trust,
Afore I gae him Reason for disgust.

MUNGO.
I thought ere now I shou'd hae had a Coach,
A bonny Place, and Gow'd in ilka pouch.
Sae high the Laird my Expectations rais'd?
Sae muckle ware the waefu' Bubbles prais'd?
And yet I'm forc'd wi' mighty Toil and Sweat,
To win a Groat to get my Guts some Meat.
Sae sad it is for sic a chiel as me,
To rax for Riches &mdash; in a rough South-Sea.

WILLIE.
Bessy and I, gen she had faithfu prov'd,
Mught lang ere now hae shawn how weil we lov'd.
Ae House and Bed mught fair'd us baith fu wiel,
But Tam, curst Tam and her hae play'd the Deel,
The Bairns I thought to gotten a' my sell,
Maun e'en be his.  This very Thought is Hell.

DAVIE.
Had Coly spar'd my tyddy Lamb, I vow,
It wad hae been a stately Creature now:
I might hae sell'd it &mdash; for some futhy Men
Wad ne'er hae stood to gi'en me three pund ten.
Or gen I pleas'd to keep it mang the rest,
It mught hae prov'd an unca' fruitfu Beast.
For 'twas a Ew, a Ew of a bra kind;
Her gutcher, if I right the Matter mind,
Was sent my Daddy in a Gift fu far,
Wi' as fine Ouz as e'er was straik'd wi' Tar.

MUNGO.
What is't by rob'ry, open and avow'd,
To cheat a Body out of a' his Gowd?
Tho wi' fair Face and a fase fleetching Tongue,
They gard me trow I shou'd na want it lang.
I wonder fouk can glour us in the Face,
Whan they do wrang, and their ain sell disgrace.

WILLIE.
It wad na vex'd my Spirit half sae sair,
Gen they had only kist, and done nae mair:
I cou'd forgie a stown dint in the Dark,&mdash;
But openly they ran to the haf Mark.
A while afore I fawnd them in a Grove,
And heard them tell some unca tales o' Love.
Yet a' the time the Glaeky gard me trow,
She'd Marry me &mdash; I was a Fool I vow.

DAVID.
Coly, fase Tyke!  without a' Conscience ran,
(I wish I may no in my Anger bann!)
In fair foor Day, and did the wicket deed,
Then cock'd his Tail, and fast awa he fled.
Whitefoot and Bawtie present ware I heard,
And ill ye ken is easy to be leard;
Gen, after his Example, they shou'd grow,
Sheep-stealers too, what sall poor Davie do?

MUNGO.
How can I think upo my little Poze,
And my Heart no' fa down into my Hose?
Twas blythsom anes to take the Yellow Hoord
Out frae the Clout, and tell it on the Board.
O!  how the Pennies glister'd in my Een.
That Laird!  thae Brokers!  wou'd I ne'er had seen.

WILLIE.
O!  how I'm wounded to the very Heart,
To think that ought shoud me frae Betty part.
She was the gayest Lass that e'er I sa',
Ay unca Heartsom, clean redd up and bra.
Fu fait and Jimp she was about the Waist,
Had fine tight Legs, and wow a snawy Breast.
But than her Cheeks, her Lips, her Eyes sae rare,&mdash;
She might e'en wi' my Lady's sell compare.
O!  wha' cou'd see her, (God forgie my Sin!)
And no find a' his Heart Strings dirl within.

DAVIE.
O! 'twas a bonny Sight, amang the Coup,
To see my Lambkin o'er the Bushes loup.
Upo' the Staines it danc'd, and, whan I drave
My Sheep to Fald, it ran afore the Leve.
Ae Day I thought I shou'd hae pish'd my Breiks,
To see it dounch my Bawties hawket Cheeks.
The Cur was sleeping, whan the canny Beast
Gard him get up and Yowl &mdash; a bonny Jest!
But now my Sport is a' to greeting turn'd,
What anes was a' my Comfort now is mourn'd.
O gen my Hands cou'd grup the Tyke, I vow,
I'd gar him girn to Death upon a Tow.

BELLAIR.
Shepherds, give o'er your soft complaining Lays,
All sing with Ease and merit more than Bays.
So well your various suff'rings have been sung,
With Charms peculiar to your Native Tongue,
That, whilst I own that all of ye sing well,
'Tis hard to judge what Swain does most excell:
And did not Bus'ness make me bid adieu,
To those sweet Plains, to Pastimes, and to you,
I  cou'd with Pleasure, 'till the Sun declin'd,
Attentive listen, and fresh Beauties find;
Beauties, which tasty Cuningham might Love,
And e'en judicious Hammond's self approve.
Yet e're I go, my best decision hear,
Nor think my Sentence partial or severe;
Since each of what he wager'd is possest,
And none allow'd to laugh at both the Rest.
For Singing well, let Mungo keep his Ox,
Tho', as I think, he nothing los'd in Stocks;
A Sum of Gold, however great or small,
Is rather lost, when buried in a Wall,
Both Useless to the Owners, and to all:
But, put in Stocks, it falls into the Hand,
Of those that spend it for their native Land;
And, like the gen'rous Campbell, Blount, and Goode,
Crown Merit well, where Merit is allow'd.
Nor have you, William, so much Cause to mourn,
Since Betty cou'd from you to Thomas turn.
The Swain's most happy, who has least to do
With Lasses, who can Jilt and break a Vow.
To other Strains adapt your tuneful Reed,
And joy that you from Misery are freed.
But David is a Sufferer, I own,
And hath most Ground of all the Three to moan.
David is poor, his Lamb was all his Pride,
That Lamb can ne'er revive again; beside,
He lost his Dog, and those that yet remain,
From his Example, may undo the Swain.
But let not David be oppress'd with Grief,
I'll go to Court, and thence procure relief.
Craggs is a wise, a gen'rous Soul, I'm sure,
No Swain can suffer much, whilst he is Cloath'd with Pow'r.
