SCENE:  PALACE YARD.
ENTER JEMMY TWITCHER AND GENTLE SHEPHERD.

SHEPHERD.
Tell me, dear Jemmy, tell me what to say,
O!  Death hath snatch'd my lovely Girl away!
Where shall I go, where, to relieve my Care,
Tell me, my gentle Twitcher, tell me where?
Oh!  the sad Loss my noblest Spirits damp,
My Joy, my all is fled in Amie Stamp.

TWITCHER.
Rave not, my Gentle Shepherd, but repair
To Doctor Hayes &mdash; he can relieve your Care:
'Tis Doctor Hayes that does such wonderous Good,
With his clear Patriot Drop &mdash; for English Blood:
Let not her Death your noble Courage damp,
My Grief is great as yours for Amie Stamp.

SHEPHERD.
No Drop, no Comfort, can I take, dear Friend,
My Joy with lovely Amie's at an End;
Oh think, my Friend, what happen'd t' other Day,
When my dear Cyder Niece was snatch'd away!
This recent Woe on such a Deep, might damp
Hyrcanian Tygers &mdash; Oh, dear Amie Stamp.

TWITCHER.
Is not my Grief as great as yours, dear Swain?
Is he not dead, the Darling of the Plain?
The little Darling that I nurs'd and bred,
Supply'd his Pocket, and his Hunger fed!
The little Darling, can we cease to moan,
Anti-Sejanus, Oh, he's dead and gone!
Think of the Genius lost, the Man who wrote
Perils of Poetry, and Morals taught;
What Ear can hear it, and the Soul not damp,
Anti-Sejanus dead, and Amie Stamp.

SHEPHERD.
Alas he's gone, and I have Cause to rue,
The Death of one to us, poor Shepherds, true:
He who could sing beyond what Churchill sung,
For Truths flow'd mended from his lisping tongue;
He that in ev'ry House, and ev'ry Town,
Spread our good Deads, and echo'd our Renown:
These Griefs, these Frettings, Soul and Genius cramp,
Anti-Sejanus dead, and Amie Stamp.

TWITCHER.
No more, dear Gentle Shepherd.  Let's repair
From these sad Scenes, to yonder blooming Square;
There we shall find the Duke of Spitalfields,
His Grace's Tongue some Honey ever yields:
There is Lord Warrant, Lord Legation too,
Longfoot, and Humphry Riot, ever true:
Let not her Death your noble Courage damp,
I'll get a Second, chaste as Amie Stamp.
