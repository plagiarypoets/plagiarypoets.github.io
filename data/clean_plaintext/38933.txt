Near yonder gate, the entrance to a wood,
"The village preacher's modest mansion stood.
A man he was" who own'd religion's sway;
Unlike the pastors of the present day.
No worldly gain was he e'er taught to prize;
His motive virtue, and his aim the skies.
With doctrines sound his audience' souls he reached;
"And, strange to tell, he practic'd what he preach'd."
When the poor beggar for assistance pray'd,
His friendly arm their wretched wand'ring staid.
No suppliant's prayer e'er pass'd unheeded by:
Tear answer'd tear, and sigh succeeded sigh.
Altho' no lover of the strolling race,
As pity call'd he heard each dubious case;
If false dismiss'd them from his grateful fare,
Since Misery only gain'd admittance there.
But if their story, told devoid of art,
Without a colouring reach'd the tender heart,
Then with what love, what eagerness, what zeal,
He strove their sorrows, sicknesses to heal;
Declar'd the means to bear affliction's rod,
And taught subjection to the will of God.
When e'er his parish from their duty swerv'd,
Their passions, vices, inclinations serv'd,
He with a care paternal urg'd reclaim,
In just proportion to his generous aim;
Argued from reason's, that from scripture's laws;
A great defender of a greater cause!
When sickness rag'd, from door to door he went,
His aid to all with equal pleasure lent:
With love benign administer'd relief,
And truly joy'd to mitigate their grief.
As to these duties, so to others true,&mdash;
His every action like the notic'd few;
Free from ambition, envy, pride, or strife,
He pass'd in solitude &mdash; a godly life:
Till death approaching led his soul away
From dreary regions &mdash; to eternal day.
