SCENE, A ROOM AT BROOKE'S.

Night, o're the world her sooty veil had spread,
When thieves the church-yard plunder for the DEAD;
When CONSCIENCE swelling in the VILLAIN'S breast,
Steals from his throbbing heart the balm of rest;
Bids, 'mid the gloom, the sword of JUSTICE rise,
And hovering spectres dash with dread his eyes:
"Past three o'clock," the drowsy watchman bawl'd,
When luckless Carlo, by curs'd ill-fortune mauld,
At Brooke's sat, with lifted eyes, alone&mdash;
He gave the dice a deep desponding groan,
And grinning, thus&mdash;

CARLO.
&mdash;"Ah!  Imps accurs'd!  to you
I owe the Duns, that all my steps pursue!
False to my hopes, and faithless to my hand,
Through you, not sixpence can my purse command&mdash;
Through you, a BEGGAR must I roam the street,
Gall'd by the silent scorn of all I meet!
Unable now to purchase one poor egg!
Yet, like the PRODIGAL, asham'd to beg.
Where, imps of horror, is your sooty Sire,
To whom my soul was barter'd for his hire&mdash;
Who now forsakes the man, he once approv'd,
And lying, leaves to woe, the WRETCH he lov'd?"

SATAN.
"Ungrateful C&mdash;!"  the Prince of Darkness cried,
From Hell, upstarting, at the Gambler's side:
"Let not on me, thy tide of scandal roll,
But tell me, since I bargain'd for thy soul,
How hath thy patron, Satan, broke his word?"

CARLO.
"Lord of my fortunes!  of my life, the Lord,
In abject wretchedness, thy slave behold!
Who, for thy service, owns his SOUL was sold?
But, say &mdash; are this world's joys to charm no more?
Is WEALTH for ever gone, and SPLENDOR o'er,
Say, shall Newmarket turf, no more delight,
Nor venal beauty lull the darksome night?
Say, &mdash; of so little value, is my soul?"

SATAN.
"With flow'ry speeches think not to cajole.
Alas!  what thousands hath thy riot spent?
Not EMPIRES, can thy squand'ring heart content.
In vain for more thy ragged PARTY call;
The COALITION-TRIBE hath had my ALL.
Nor is my MAMMON from me fled alone&mdash;
Lo!  through your GANG, my REPUTATION'S gone!
Think of the years I've been at thy command!
In BRITAIN have I toil'd, nay, left that land:
To BOSTON, wafted every imp of hell,
To bid the base Americans rebel;
And thus accomplish'd, what thou wished'st most,
The western world to WEEPING BRITAIN lost!
Thy letters, wishes, how for thee I bore,
To Gallia's mean, proud, bankrupt perjur'd shore;
Strain'd ev'ry nerve, Old Franklin's heart to win,
And gain'd that hoary Veteran in sin.
Through PITT and VIRTUE, lo!  my pow'rs expire!
Yet when by FATE those giant foes retire,
A second CLOUD may blind the NATION'S eyes,
Then ANARCHY with all our HOSTS shall rise:
Of EMPIRE, then, the heights, shalt thou obtain,
And HORSES, WH&mdash;RES and DICE be thine again.
