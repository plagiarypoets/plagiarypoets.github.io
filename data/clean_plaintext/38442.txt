When JOVE to punish guilty man,
His fiat to PANDORA gave,
To scatter plagues o'er every land,
And death coneal in every wave.
Of horrid crimes the just rewards,
From the dire pox thou flow'st, the scourge of impious bards.

Dread power!  around whose dusky brow
Somnific poppies form a wreath,
When from some mist clad mountain thou
Enwrapt'st in shades the vale beneath;
Or riding in November's storm,
With pestilential breath, dost nature's face deform.

Where'er thou spread'st thy raven wing,
Dire winter wears a thicker gloom,
Mute all the music of the spring,
Nor Maia breathes a sweet perfume.
No flow'ret buds, nor zephyr blows,
But sudden hemlocks rise, and baleful nightshade grows.

With love of deathless glory fir'd,
The man of verse invokes the nine,
And still as fancy seems inspir'd,
A laurel grasps in every line.
Thy power, oblivious, oft presides,
And far from Pindar's grove the slumb'ring poet guides.

Stern foe to ev'ry lovely muse,
Whose leaden eye-balls ghastly roll!
Thy dimly-gleaming looks diffuse
A chearless languour o'er my soul!
O grant my humble suppliant's prayer,
To dark Cimmerian caves, and dreary damps repair.

Or would'st thou rule a kindred dear
To BELGIA'S low-spread region fly,
Where through the wide revolving year,
Congenial vapours shut the sky;
And yawning millions crave thy reign
There 'mid eternal fogs, thy sluggish sway maintain.
