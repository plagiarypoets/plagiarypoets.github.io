It is not death, that some time in a sigh
This eloquent breath shall take its speechless flight;
That some time the live stars, which now reply
In sunlight to the sun, shall set in night;
That this warm conscious flesh shall perish quite,
And all life's ruddy springs forget to flow;&mdash;
That verse shall cease, and the immortal spright
Be lapp'd in alien clay, and laid below:&mdash;
It is not death to know this, but to know
That pious thoughts, which visit at new graves,
In tender pilgrimage will cease to go
So duly and so oft; and when grass waves
Over the past-away, there may be then
No resurrections in the minds of men!
