Our steadfast Bard, to his own genius true,
Still bade his Muse fit audience find, though few;
Scorning the judgement of a trifling age,
To choicer spirits he bequeath'd his page.
He too was scorn'd, and to Britannia's shame
She scarce for half an age knew Milton's name:
But now, his fame by every trumpet blown,
We on his deathless trophies raise our own.
Nor art nor nature did his genius bound;
Heaven, hell, earth, chaos, he survey'd around:
All things his eye, through wits bright empire thrown,
Beheld, and made what it beheld his own.
Such Milton was:  'tis ours to bring him forth,
And yours to vindicate neglected worth.
Such heaven-taught numbers should be more than read,
More wide the manna through the nation spread.
Like some bless'd spirit he to night descends,
Mankind he visits, and their steps befriends;
Through mazy error's dark perplexing wood
Points out the path of true and real good,
Warns erring youth, and guards the spotless maid,
From spell of magic vice by reason's aid.
Attend the strains; and should some meaner phrase
Hang on the style and clog the nobler lays,
Excuse what we with trembling hand supply,
His the pure essence, ours the grosser mean
Through which his spirit is in action seen.
Observe the force, observe the flame divine
That glows, breathes, acts in each harmonious line.
Great objects only strike the generous heart;
Praise the sublime, o'erlook the mortal part;
Be there your judgment, here your candour shown;
Small is our portion &mdash; and we wish 'twere none.
