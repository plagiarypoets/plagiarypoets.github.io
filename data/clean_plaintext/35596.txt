Thou, who beholdst with dewy eye,
The sleeping leaves, and folded flowers,
And hear'st the night wind lingering sigh,
Through the shadowy woods and twilight bowers;
Thou wast the signal once that seem'd to say,
Hilario's beating breast reprov'd my long delay.

I see thy emerald lustre stream,
O'er these rude cliffs, and cavern'd shore;
But here, orisons to thy beam
The woodland chauntress pours no more;
Nor I, as once, thy lamp propitious hail,
Seen indistinct through tears; confus'd, and dim, and pale,

Soon shall thy arrowy radiance shine
On the broad ocean's restless wave,
Where this poor, cold swoln form of mine
Shall shelter in its billowy grave,
Safe from the scorn the world's sad outcasts prove,
Unconscious of the pain of ill-requited love.
