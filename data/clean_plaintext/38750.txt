All-pow'rful Love then gently touch'd the lyre,
The throbbing bosom felt the kindling fire;
And whilst the pleasing pain
Ran quick through ev'ry vein,
How did each beating pulse proclaim
His influence o'er the human frame!
His harmony imprest
Upon the feeling breast
A joy which love, and love alone, can e'er inspire.

From the soft flute he breath'd so sweet a strain,
Gladness diffused a smile o'er all the chearful plain;
Responsive echo lengthen'd ev'ry note,
And on the playful breeze did heav'nly music float.
Such the sensations he did now impart,
That ev'ry plaintive murmur reach'd the heart.

The latent flame, erst carefully conceal'd,
Each tender maid reveal'd;
The little birds on ev'ry waving spray
Resistless pow'r obey:
The sportive lambkins frolick round,
And frisk it o'er th' enamel'd ground.
His sounds melodious charm'd th' attentive throng,
All nature listen'd and approv'd the song.
