I will write down thy name, and when 'tis writ,
Will turn me from the hum that mortals keep
In the wide world without, and gaze on it!
It telleth of the past &mdash; calling from sleep
Such dear, yet mournful thoughts, as make us smile, and weep.

Belov'd and best!  what thousand feelings start,
As o'er the paper's course my fingers move&mdash;
My Brother!  dearest, kindest as thou art!
How can these lips my heart's affection prove?
I could not speak the words, if words could speak my love.

Together have we past our infant hours,
Together sported Childhood's spring away,
Together cull'd young Hope's fast budding flowers,
To wreathe the forehead of each coming day!
Yes!  for the present's sun makes e'en the future gay.

And when the laughing mood was nearly o'er,
Together, many a minute did we wile
On Horace' page, or Maro's sweeter lore;
While one young critic, on the classic style,
Would sagely try to frown, and make the other smile.

But now alone thou con'st the ancient tome&mdash;
And sometimes thy dear studies, it may be,
Are cross'd by dearer dreams of me and home!
Alone I muse on Homer &mdash; thoughts are free&mdash;
And if mine often stray, they go in search of thee!

I may not praise the here &mdash; I will not bless!
Yet all thy goodness doth my memory bear,
Cherish'd by more than Friendship's tenderness&mdash;
And, in the silence of my evening prayer,
Thou shalt not be forgot &mdash; thy dear name shall be there!
