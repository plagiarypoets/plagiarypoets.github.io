The ither e'ening whan the sin gaed down,
An' hameward trampit ilka bursen clown,
Auld honest Robin dander'd o'er the gait,
To knaise wi' Geordie till the hour grew late.
He fand the guid man restan at the door,
On seat that gain'd the laird in days o' yore;
Fu' blithe the carle lean'd too his eldron back,
Neist took a pinch, an' syne began to crack.

ROBIN.
Weel, neighbour Geordie, how gangs a' wi' you?
Its e'en a lang time sin I saw you now:
For a' the gait be scarce twa tether length,
It cuts my wizzen fair an' bangs my strength;
I'm nae sae tight as anes I us'd to be,
Na, na, its a' gawn down the brae wi' me.
Come gie's your news, &mdash; is a' the beer land done?
Will a' the peats be winn'd and led hame soon?
I'll warran' now the wark'd done i' the yaird,
An' ye'll be gawn a day to gie the laird:
Or tell me, man!  what's doin' yont the sea,
Will Britain an' her bairnies ne'er agree?
Will peacefu' days ne'er blink on them again,
An' honest fowk come snugly to their ain?

GEORDIE.
I've fairlied, Robin!  what kept you awa':
I hae na seen you sin the Lenton sna'.
Heigh, man!  you're unco dung, fair fell'd wi' eild,
An' weel I mind you whan a frackle chield.
Our beer-land's o'er, 'maist a' our peats are led,
The yard o' ilka weed fu' cleanly wed.
An ouk or twa brings on the landlord's hay,
An' than his honour maunna want a day.

For news, they tell us, in America,
Our Highland regiments bear the brag awa'.
Wi' gude claymores gie rebel lads their paiks,
An' fairly tuilzie for the Land o' Cakes,
Gang wudly thro' ilk desperate attack,
For Scotland's glory mint na to look back;
Frae sic accounts, I hear our gauger say't,
That a' will shortly end as we wou'd hae't.&mdash;
But, man!  what think ye was I tauld yestreen,
Frae ane I always look'd on as a frien',
That some black act was lately past aboun,
Wad keep us i' the mirk o' a' was done,
Wad gie nae mair ilk Friday to be seen,
That wale o' buiks the Oukly Magazine.
Whareon I aft hae glowr'd by ingle-side,
An' saw the tales o' a' the kingdoms wide;
Some stent it now maun pay, or legal fees,
For ilka ane, nae less than three baubies,
E'en unco hard &mdash; but Patie's to the town,
To fetch us word if sicken news be down.

ROBIN.
That's vera strange!  believe't I little can,
The merry buik put out by Ruddiman.
Wharefrae I meikle lair an' insight got,
Was tauld what gait to guide my little spot,
To feed my sheep, an' sort my tarry woo,
An' troth I need na the directions rue.
Fair fa' the dainty wight, be wha he will,
Wha' 'mang our glimmers shaw'd sic unco skill.
Wad ony body o' but haflins sense
Cry down this buik for sake o' twa three pence.
Fu' aften hae I read, wi' meikle glee,
The doins o' our troops ayont the sea,
An' gauf'd hail gloomings as I watch'd the beasts,
At ane ca'd Momus, an' his merry jests;
Wi' ither men o' lear baith up an' down,
An some nae farrer aff than the neist town,
I'm sure we'll meikle miss sic blithesome tales,
An' now gang dowie o'er the weary dales:
But yonder Patie comes, we'll soon ken a'
An' if what's done be done by dint o' law.

Gude e'en, auld neighbour!  how fares a' wi' you?
What think ye, Geordie!  a' yon news is true!
We'll get the Oukly Magazine nae mair,
Unless we dow some further pennies spare:
See, there's twa leaves will tell you mair than I,
An' on whase back this meikle ill maun lie.

ROBIN.
The black mishaunter light upo' their snouts
Wha in the law hae made sic in's and out's!
'Ere mony feck o' ither years be run,
They'll gar us pay for gawn upo' the grun':
But we're but poor, an' maun the laws obey,
For a' they do ne'er venture to say &mdash; Nay.
An' yet I'm blithe, &mdash; I'se soon gar write to town,
To send me, oukly, baith the papers down,
I'll raise what siller's neefu' to be sent,
As lang's I hae a gimmer on the bent,
Tho' I shou'd sell the mare or flecked stirk,
For haflins naething gie you bing o' birk.

GEORDIE.
I'll do the same. &mdash; This night I'll cry o'er James,
An' gar him write a letter in our names.
We'll yet hae news, they're no sae vera dear,
An' we may richer grow anither year.

But Robin, rise, step in an' tak a skair,
O' our night's sow'ns, an' what we hae to spare;
Some hameward kebbuck, an' a drink o' whey,
An' then I'll see you safely o'er the way.
Its hastins dark, and by the time we're done,
We'll get some glimm'rings frae the dowie moon.
