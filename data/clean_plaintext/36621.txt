O, what is fortitude?  is it to bear
With heart of stone the ills we cannot fly;
To struggle sorrow into mute despair,
To freeze the very founts of feeling dry,
And stand with brow erect, and heartless eye,
Mocking the tempests that around us close?
Oh!  no, for fortitude could ne'er deny
This one sad solace for our nature's woes,
Or shut from human heart the dearest of its throes!

Is it, of many a treasured joy bereft,
To mourn life's better part of comfort dead!
And trembling for the little all that's left,
To think on youthful prospects quickly fled,
As rainbow tints o'er skies of April shed,
Yet lose all grief, in thankfulness, to find
The storms that spent their fury on our head,
Have left improved all that they left behind:
Nay, this is even more, it is to be resigned!
