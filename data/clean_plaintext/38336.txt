Since Jemmy sings the Pudding's sav'ry taste,
In lines responsive to the lumpish theme,
Why may not I my rustic lay adorn
With praise of Wooden Spoon?  Whether of box,
Brazil, Mahogany, or other plant
Of Indian title proud; or humbler ash,
Or dunghill-shading sycamore, thy frame&mdash;
Hail Lignum Vitae!  whose capacious mouth,
Replete with pudding driping from the roast,
(A feast peculiar to the Yorkshire swain)
Or soup of pease, or gruel, or fat broth,
Produced from neck of mutton, greets my taste
With titillating joy.  Tho' Nell may boast
Her spoon of pewter glares with brighter ray,
Or Peer exulting shew Potosi's pride,
Yet, throat-regaling Spoon, I hail Thee still;
Still praise thy virtues, and apply thine aid
Benignant, to repel the various qualms,
Which Hunger, all-devouring monster!  breeds
On fainting lungs.  The Tinker, tho' he moulds
The spoon of lead obedient to his will,
Or makes of pewter heav'nly bright its form,
Or copper blazing like the sun, yet he
(Conscious of their inferior excellence)
To brace the nerves relax'd by daily toil,
To drive fell hunger from his weary breast,
Demands thy aid alone. &mdash; Oft as from plough,
Or fold, or barn returning, Collin sees
Thee all immers'd in the full-streaming mess,
He grins with pleasure. &mdash; Sympathising teeth,
And lips, and belly beat the known alarm,
Lo!  now voracious his extended jaws
Wide-op'ning make thee way &mdash; And now they shut.
Yet hail once more!  Hail to thy safe return
From that deep-swallowing maw! &mdash; Not more delights
The ladle floating in the spacious bowl
Of Punch ambrosial, bane of human care!
Or measuring out to the half-meeting lips
The smiling bumper, endless fount of joy!
Whose virtues I revere, as next to thee
In kind, or use.  But vain would be the strife
To give thy merits all their praises due;
So I reluctant leave the copious theme
To bards of better Taste.
