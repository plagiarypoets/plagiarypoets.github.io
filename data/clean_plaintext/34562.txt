Nymphs, that mountain, wood, or hill,
Ere the day peeps, lightly tread;
Ye, that haunt where whispering rill
Creeps along the matted mead;

Or the sea-worn beach do hold,
Green-hair'd sisters of the main;
Hither haste, and strait unfold
Each the treasures of her reign.

Be they flow'rs of brightest hue,
Such as fade not with the dew
That chilling Autumn scatters wide:
Be they wreaths of myrtle green,
Such as deck the Paphian queen,
Or shells with queint enamel dyed.

And "Hymen, Io Hymen" be your song;
Hymen resound the woods, and hills, and shores along.

Hymen raiseth high his brand
Newly touch'd with chastest fire;
Thousand pleasures at command
Purple-winged round him quire.

He of these the father is,
Father of each social joy;
Soothing with transcendent bliss
Cares that mortal breasts annoy.

Loose Desires affrighted fly;
And the fiend Adultery,
That sunk old Troy in foul disgrace:
Prostitution, whelm'd with dread,
Trembling seeks her masked head
To hide among the savage race.

Let "Hymen Io Hymen" be your song;
Hymen, resound the woods, and shores along.

But in virgin splendour bright
Lo!  the blushing Maid appears.
Venus from a cloud of light
Mildly whispering sooths her fears:

"Happy shores whereon you tread,
Shores with peace eternal crown'd!
Calm thy fluttering bosom's dread;
Nothing here but joys are found.

"Haste; for thee thy blooming mate
Doth with hopeful rapture wait:
His peer not all the world doth hold:
Him &mdash; But soon thyself shall see,
Blessing thy kind destiny,
How little shallow fame hath told."

"Now "Hymen, Io Hymen" be the song;
Hymen resound the woods, and hills, and shores along.
