Lo, too, in sight, the youth of Severn's side!
His name who knows not?  in yon dusky vale
Stalks lonely; striving, but in vain, to hide
His woes in darkness, whilst he tells the gale
That whistles round a melancholy tale:
Him Hope refused her ever-cheering face:
On frenzy's tide was rent his shatter'd sail;
What wonder then, on life's disgusting race,
If, recreant in the course, he sickening stopp'd his pace.

Lord of some talent, and in these dull days,
When not to wholly fail is to succeed,
Th' awakening Muse with no ignoble bays,
Harold, hath deck'd thy brow; Parnassian meed
Not undeserved!  But of that master breed
Thou wouldst be thought, those souls who sway mankind;
Not thine, in sooth, nor sprung from such a seed!
But where caprice or passion lent the wind,
Veered round to every point that weathercock thy mind.
