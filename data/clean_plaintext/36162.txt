He who would emulate Dan Spenser's song
Must own a bosom thrill'd with tenderness,
A fancy prodigal, a genius strong,
A power of numbers fitted to express
All tones, all feelings; nay, he must possess
A pure simplicity of heart and mind,
A worth of soul, a moral gentleness
That joys in every joy of human kind.
With these should piety its lustre join:
This thou hast added, Minstrel all unknown!
Much of my namings were before thine own;
And hence thy verse will still have power to shine,
When the false brilliance of the worldling's lay
Shall fade, like meteor-gleams of yesterday.
