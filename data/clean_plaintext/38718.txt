Yes, Phillis we'll trip o'er the Meads,
And hasten away to the Plain;
Where Shepherds attend with their Reeds,
To welcome my Love and her Swain.

The Lark is exalted in Air,
The Linnet sings perch'd on the Spray;
Our Lambs stand in need of our Care,
Then let us not lengthen Delay.

The Pleasure I feel with my Dear,
While gamesome young Lambs are at Sport,
Exceeds the Delight of a Peer,
That shines with such Grandeur at Court.

When Collin and Strephon go by,
They form a Disguise for a while;
They see how I'm bless'd with a Sigh,
But Envy forbids them to smile.

Let great Folks of Liberty prate,
T' enjoy it take infinite Pains;
But Liberty's primitive State
Is only enjoy'd on the Plains.

With Phillis I rove to and fro,
With her my gay Minutes are spent;
'Twas Phillis first taught me to know
That Happiness flows from Content.
