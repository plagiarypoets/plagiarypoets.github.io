My Lord now quits his venerable seat,
The Six Clerk on his padlock turns the key,
From bus'ness hurries to his snug retreat,
And leaves Vacation, and the Town to me.

Now all is hush'd, asleep the eye of care,
And Lincoln's Inn a solemn stillness holds,
Save where the Porter whistles o'er the Square,
Or Pompey barks, or basket woman scolds.

Save that from yonder pump, and dusty stair,
The moping shoe-black, and the laundry maid,
Complain of such, as from the town repair,
And leave their little quarterage unpaid.

In those dull chambers, where old parchments lie,
And useless draughts, in many a mould'ring heap,
Each for parade to catch the client's eye,
Salkeld and Ventris in Oblivion sleep.

In these dread hours, what now remains for me,
Still to the stool and to the desk confin'd,
Debarr'd from Autumn shades, and Liberty,
Whose lips are soft as my Cleora's kind?

Hail, charming maid!  how does thy presence gild
The brow of Care, and mitigate my pains!
With thee, (such extasy thy beauties yield)
Bondage is free, and hugs thy pleasing chains.

Bless'd in thy love, sincerely I despise
The quibble warmly urg'd with many a frown,
Hear each opinion of the learn'd and wise,
Nor envy Cato's wig, nor Tully's gown.
