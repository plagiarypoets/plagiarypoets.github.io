My Tanks they are full of fine Fish,
Whose Flavour invites one to eat,
My Jungles abound to my Wish,
With wild Hogs, a delicate Meat.

I never yet met with a Loss,
My Debtors pay up what they owe;
My Biggahs are cover'd with Moss,
Where the Gram and the Paddy does grow.

My Lambkins are fruitful and gay,
And my Kidlings do sport with my goats,
If my Flocks ever carelessly stray,
They're pick'd up by my Dandies in Boats.

My Trees they are fit for the Fire,
Which in Faggots I cut for my Fair;
Not a Bird that I heard her admire,
But I straight went and roasted it there.

I have bought a fine Gift for my Fair,
A young Minah, along with its Dam,
They shall chant forth the Name of my dear,
As already they join in "Ram Ram."

Then my Charmer will list to my Tale,
Ev'ry Day and each Night in her Praise,
To Tom Tom I never shall fail,
And my Bearers will echo my Lays.
