O Louse, inhabitant of school-boys coat,
Or who on Taylors pericranium crawl'st,
Luxurious animal!  whose dayly food
The richest emanations are of man,
Which from th' imperial seat of Reason flow.

Beneath the Poet's rectilineal wigg,
When to the silent solitary gloom
Of his aerial mansion he ascends,
Thou rid'st triumphant; his companion sole
His labour's consort and invention's aid.
For when the peevish Muse her help denies,
And dinner hangs dependent on a rhyme;
He, by the pleasing titillation mov'd,
Scratches the wish'd idea from his brain.
Shall he in Dedications daub a lord,
Or sing his Mistress in the jocund Ode;
And vainly to himself ascribe the Strain?
Ungrateful Bard!  to thee of right belong
His Lordship's virtues and AURELIA'S charms;
To thee, his best of Patrons, Muses, Friends.
