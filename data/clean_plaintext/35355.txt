From Laughter's dome, where nothing now remain'd
Of novelty unseen, we turn'd away,
And upward next addrest our patient feet,
To gain the summit of that lofty mount,
Which rose conspicuous from the central base 
Of my celestial Guide's extensive round.
No clement charms its lower clime, could boast;
Dark was the visage of the angry sky,
And cloth'd by Tempest in her thickest veil
Of louring sable clouds, thro' which at times
On livid wing the rapid lightning flew;
Succeeding which the Thunder issued forth
In deep tremendous tone his stern decree.
And yet this awful scene inspir'd not here
Unmingled terror &mdash; Pleasure too combin'd
To charm the ear, which heard with trembling joy
The elemental war. &mdash; Nor had we long
Thro' this terrific gloom pursued our way,
Until before our sight appear'd a mass
Of stone, in shape and size like one of those
Enormous piles by Vanity uprear'd
To lodge the reliques of departed Kings
In EGYPT'S haughty land, whose children thought
That bulk was splendor, and that greatness dwelt
In lifeless matter's giant form alone.
Beside its base a tyger, vast of size
And fierce of spirit, lay, whose awful voice
From time to time appal'd the silent air;
But on the pyramid's aspiring top,
Like pigmy forms, two pompous Poets sate,
And thence still look'd with self-complacence down
Upon the vale below &mdash; but other thoughts
Of less presumption would have fill'd their minds,
Had they but chanc'd to turn their eyes behind
On that ascending steep, whose arduous length
Betwixt their station and the summit lay&mdash;
Of ROME the one, who told the dismal tale
Of guilty THEBES, beset by foreign foes,
And the dire furies of fraternal hate;
Who swell'd his verse with many a turgid sound,
And left the paths of nature and of truth
To grasp at excellence beyond his reach.
The other Bard was BRITAIN'S pious son,
Who strew'd PHILANDER'S and NARCISSA'S tomb
With flow'rs of darkest hue, and devious led
The sable stream of his nocturnal song
"Thro' many a field of moral and divine."
At times, inspir'd by Feeling's genuine pow'r,
The strain was just, and ardent, and sublime;
But far more oft, on Affection's wing,
It soar'd beyond the ken of vulgar eyes,
And left both Taste and Common Sense behind.

Not far from thence another work of art
Our next attention drew, and stopt awhile
Our upward journey &mdash; 'Twas a lofty tow'r,
Which rose in all the pride of warlike pomp,
And frown'd defiance on the world below.
By Strength and Grace, two architects divine,
With equal labour and united skill,
Each finish'd fabric in the Land of Taste
Must still be rais'd, to meet the wond'ring eye
Of universal praise &mdash; but Strength had here
Labour'd alone, and in some sullen hour
These awful turrets reard'd, nor ever call'd
His fair associate to partake the toil,
And sweetly temper with her tender touch
The rude exertions of his careless hand.
One only decoration grac'd the pile:
On ev'ry battlement a golden shape
Of ROME'S imperial bird sate proudly perch'd,
And deck'd its roughness with the splendid shade
Of his triumphant wings. &mdash; Two Poets there,
In armour bold, and bolder courage clad,
To guard the fortress stood &mdash; ROMAN the one,
Who for the theme of his historic song
(That manly song, whose ev'ry rugged line
The warm indignant soul of freedom breathes)
Selected CAESAR'S more than civil war;
Who bath'd with many a stern and sullen tear
The patriot victim's of PHARSALIA'S field;
And CATO'S firm undaunted march pursu'd
Thro' all the' horrors of the LYBIAN waste.
The Sire congenial of the GALLIC stage
Beside him stood, whose vig'rous hand pourtray'd
("Tho' not with ease, nor with a RAPHAEL stroke")
The forms of ROMAN virtue &mdash; He it was
That drew the spirit masculine and bold
Of CINNA'S darling Maid; the ruthless, fierce,
Unbending foul of POMPEY'S widow'd spouse;
And stern HORATIUS, whose heroic mind
Wish'd that his, son had rais'd the shield of death,
To save his honour from inglorious flight.

But when at last both pyramid and  tow'r
Were left below, at once the sable robe,
Which o'er the troubled sky had hung till now,
To purest azure turn'd:  at once the sun
Appear'd refulgent on his flaming car,
And shed o'er all the remnant of our way
His full meridian glory; &mdash; but that way
At every step more steep and arduous grew.
Now nought was seen but barren hills of sand
O'er hills of barren sand uprising still;
A prospect faint and dreary to the sight&mdash;
But to the sight alone &mdash; for that kind Pow'r,
So long my guide and guardian, still sustain'd
My feeble frame, nor suffer'd it to feel
Fatigue or languor.  Soon, amid that sea
Of fruitless sand, on either side appear'd
A verdant isle, on which the wearied eye
Repos'd with comfort, glad once more to view
The seats of Life, and Pleasure's green abode.
Upon the left a venerable grove,
Of warlike palm and peaceful olive mixt,
Conspicuous rose, beneath whose ample shade
Together roaming, our approach descried
Three Sons of GRECIAN fame.  The Sage was there
Who deck'd so oft his philosophic page
With Fancy's brilliant flow'rs &mdash; the pupil blest
Of SOCRATES himself &mdash; to whom we owe
The lively picture of his master's fate.
And all those lessons of exalted love,
Which from his dying lips divinely flow'd.
The next was he, of orators supreme,
Against proud PHILIP'S each ambitious aim
Who roll'd resistless from his fervid tongue
Persuasion's thunder; from their shameful sleep
The men of ATHENS rous'd ; but vainly strove
To kindle up in their degen'rate breasts
The same unwearied flame  of public zeal
Which glow'd on MARATHON'S triumphant field.
There was the Critic too, whose hasty hand
Essay'd in vain the fountains to disclose
Of Eloquence sublime; that ardent judge,
Who taught his fond applause aloft to soar
On more than critic wing; and ev'n at times
O'ertook the flights he only meant to praise.

Now to the right we turn'd, and there beheld
A verdant Mount, on whose delightful top,
With eagle glance Commanding all around,
The Pow'r of Prospect lay. &mdash; With pencils arm'd,
And an exhaustless store of colours clear,
Wherewith to mimic ev'ry striking scene
Of Nature and of Art, three painter Bards
Sate on the tender turf &mdash; A ROMAN one,
Who fill'd his cup of philosophic lore,
With blind attachment, from the muddy spring
Which EPICURUS dug, but temper'd well
Th' unwholsome draught with many a precious drop
Of high poetic flavour. &mdash; BRITAIN claim'd
As her's the other two:  him first, around,
Whose gentle head the Seasons all a wreath
Unfading bound, while he describ'd so well
Their sev'ral dresses, and by turns display'd
Spring's verdant liv'ry, Summer's russet robe,
The yellow mantle rich that Autumn wears,
And Winter's hoary shroud; &mdash; but with a wreath
Of brighter beauty still had Fancy crown'd
The third sweet Poet, whose harmonious voice,
In strain so free, by Rapture's self inspir'd,
That first of themes, her various Pleasures sung,
And to such subtle and mysterious things
Gave shapes so fair, and features so divine.

Beyond these fair but solitary spots
Of green delight we had not mounted far,
Until a narrow path in sight appear'd,
Crossing the track which to the summit led
Our upward journey narrow was the path,
Nor was its narrowness allow'd to rest
Entire, but broken oft by many a rock
Rising abrupt, and many a torrent flood
That fell adown the steep with foaming haste
And wild resistless fury.  On this path
Sudden a car appear'd, which, lifted high,
Hung glitt'ring in mid air, and rush'd along
With speed so rapid, that my dazzled eye
Had only space sufficient to remark
Who there in triumph rode; to mark that there
The THEBAN Herald of OLYMPIC praise,
Lord of the Lyre, betwixt two BRITONS sate;
'Twixt him whose glowing hand the Banquet drew
Of PHILIP'S warlike son, and him whose last
Of CAMBRIAN Bards on EDWARD'S tyrant crest
Pour'd wildly forth the dark and dreary song
Of dire prophetic vengeance.  Earth contains 
No steed so firm, so fearless, and so fierce
As that swift courser of  ethereal race,
Which bore them safe along this rugged path
Of dread and danger; now from rock to rock
Bounding unhurt; across some torrent now
Urging his fiery flight; nor pausing once
Till distance wrapt them in her dusky veil,
And interposing, from the vain pursuit
Constrain'd reluctant vision to retire.

But now at last, the boundary of all,
Our upward steps, the summit of the Mount,
Appear'd within our reach, on whose green brow
A venerable oak, extending wide
His giant arms, o'ercanopy'd a seat
Of adamant eternal. &mdash; There, enthron'd
In equal majesty, two Poets sate,
The Monarchs of the Mount:  the one was he,
The Sire of GRECIAN song, who all the rage,
Of fierce ACHILLES, and the wand'rings all
Of sage ULYSSES told; whose magic pow'r
With life and motion fill'd each glowing scene,
And pour'd the torrent of unwearied fire
O'er all his tuneful page.  His great compeer
Was he, whose art with rich seraphic hues
Emblaz'd the sacred tale of EDEN lost;
Who soar'd on Elevation's boldest wing,
And rais'd to themes of more than mortal sound
His deep sonorous voice.  Both, as they sate,
Appear'd of equal size; but I could well
Perceive, delighted, that when each uprear'd
His mighty stature, BRITAIN'S giant son
Would proudly rise, and leave the GREEK below.

While thus with patient persevering steps
We gain'd upon the Mount, some secret pow'r
Gradual refin'd the circumambiant air
From pure to purer still:  but when at last
Our feet victorious on the summit stood,
With such delicious welcome did the gale
Greet our approach, methought that Heav'n's own breath
Around my temples blew; nor rested there
The strong ethereal virtue; soon I felt,
With glad surprize, its purifying pow'r
Ev'n to my inmost bosom, driving thence
Each thought unworthy of a Poet's name,
Each vulgar hope, and ev'ry sordid care,
With each desire but that of honest fame
And ev'ry passion but the love of song.
