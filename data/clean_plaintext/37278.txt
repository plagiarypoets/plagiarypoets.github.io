So thou hast flourish'd &mdash; had thy day &mdash; and died!
And all the beauties the remains of thee
Are semblance in thine offspring, and the tide
Of recollection, what thou wast, or living seem'd to be.
And this is all earth's greatest monarchs see!
Save the strange pomp of burials, statues, tombs,&mdash;
The mortal honours of departed majesty.
Oh!  could'st thou, blighted beauty, but resume
Th' past, when thou and all around thee were in bloom!

But thou must perish with the reckless day,
And sacrifice thy loveliness to death;
E'en as meteor thou shalt pass away,
Or vanish like the ray which gave thee birth;
Thy glowing days are past &mdash; the fragrant breath,
Wrapt in th' drooping foliage of thy bosom, sleeps
As if it had not been, &mdash; thy leaves, which budded forth
Their beauteous hues, have ceased to bloom.  Thus all sweep
Away, and mingle with the earth, as billows with the deep.
