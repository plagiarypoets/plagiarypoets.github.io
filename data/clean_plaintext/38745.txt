Thou, sweet Companion of my lonely Hours,
How much I miss thy wonted chearful Song!
How much regret thy silent vocal Pow'rs,
Thou didst, well pleas'd, from Morn to Night prolong!

Oft has my Heart by various Cares opprest,
By Friend's Neglect, or rich Man's haughty Scorn,
Felt from thy festive Notes some Pause of Rest,
And lost a-while my Memory's painful Thorn?

Thy Life small Change by Times or Seasons found,
The sullen Winter, or the Summer gay,
Saw thee contented thro' their constant Round,
Warbling thy Sonnets each succeeding Day.

Yet, when the Sun his Golden Beams display'd,
By sprightlier Motions, and a louder Tone,
To his inspiring Pow'r was Homage paid,
As if thou felt'st his Deity alone.

Still with the Tempest's Roar, or Rain's Descent,
No sullent Pause disturb'd thy steady Joy;
Thro' Nature's Tumult cheering Notes were sent,
As if thy Life was form'd above Alloy.

Oft as my Hand thy Daily Food supply'd,
Thy Eye how vivid!  and thy Chirp how sweet!
Unlike to Man, thy Debt was ne'er deny'd,
With grateful Signs thou did'st my Kindness greet.

No ling'ring Pains, no slow or dire Disease
Were the sad Preludes to thy pleasant Death;
One sudden Stroke, and that receiv'd with Ease,
Clos'd thy gay Life, and stopp'd thy sighless Breath.

So the World's Master wish'd to meet his Fate,
Afraid to meet it in a solemn Form;
Thy Life was harmless, and thy End was great,
His Crimes deserv'd it in a ruder Storm.

O!  could my Days like thine contented flow,
And not one Fear, or Care, or Doubt molest;
Let Death then finish with one silent Blow,
And I, like thee, drop suddenly to Rest.
