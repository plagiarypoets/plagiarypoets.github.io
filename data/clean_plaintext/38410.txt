'Tis sweet to watch the gems that stud the sky,
Strewn o'er the concave, ebon vault of night;
'Tis sweet to watch the meteors as they fly,
With streaming blue, and dazzling wild-fires bright;
'Tis sweet to view the pale and icy light
Of the fair moon, the brightest gem among
The purple diadem with silver dight,
And veil'd with thin grey clouds, that fly along
Through the wide air in hasty, varied throng.

'Tis sweet to watch the bosom of old ocean,
Hurrying from out his coral, crystal caves,
And rocking to and fro, with cradling motion,
Lulling the vessel with his briny waves;
While Cynthia dancing on his grassy graves,
Shows the lone mariner &mdash; who to the low
Sound of his oar against the water &mdash; braves
A song &mdash; while quicker still he strives to row,
To reach his humble home, and smile away his woe.

'Tis sweet to watch the shadows stealing slow
Along the vale of eve &mdash; the sun decline;
'Tis sweet to see the sun-beams gently go
Down the bright path of Sol, with ray divine;
'Tis sweet to see the star of evening shine:
But at this hour, with sacred silence blest,
While other thoughts are absent be it mine,
Of men and of their minds, to fly in quest,
While their dread passions, pleasures, all are lull'd to rest.
