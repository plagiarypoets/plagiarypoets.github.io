Lesbia, whom some thought a lovely creature,
Doth sometimes praise some other womans feature:
Whom worthy fame, by beauties merits praises,
But onely of their seemely parts she tels,
Whom she doth sure beleeve, her selfe excels.
So, Linus praises Churchyard in his censure,
Not Sydney, Daniel, Constable, nor Spencer.
