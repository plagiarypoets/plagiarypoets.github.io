Ill-boding Fears away;
And all the sickly train of black Despair
With self-consuming Care,
Vanish, like shades, before the rising day:
Hie to some chearless grove,
As midnight dark, where sun-beams ne'er are seen
The clust'ring trees between;
Or to some lonely cloyster drear and pale,
Where meagre Phantoms sail;
There 'midst wan shapes and nightly horrors rove.

Rising on this happy Isle
Pleasure sheds her morning smile;
Op'ning to the genial rays,
The bud of Joy it's leaves displays:
Love and Glory now agree
To form a guiltless Jubilee.
British Nymphs your lays prepare;
Greet, O!  greet this Royal Fair:
For sure much Grace and Beauty dwells
In Her, who even you excels.
British swains that wont to charm
With Celia's praise the lonely farm,
Now a loftier strain express
Sacred to GEORGE, and Happiness;
GEORGE, who in the rolls of Fame
High exalts the British name.
Let every feature of our Isle
Form itself into a smile:
Let each loyal foot advance
In a many-winding dance.

Come, fair Peace!  with olive wand,
(Too long a stranger to this Land)
Join the jovial choir of Youth,
And all the sisterhood of Truth:
And each and all with glee conspire
To strike the silver-sounding lyre,
Whose magic strains shall quick impart
To the mazes of the heart
Raptures, that never know to cloy.
These with nicest skill apply;
And amidst the sprightly throng
Raise a sweet-enchanting Song:
Your notes to Royal CHARLOTTE give,
In whom the purest virtues life.

Hither come, at GEORGE'S call,
Bright Euphrosyne!  and all
The Nymphs, who wait on favour'd Man,
And strive to bless Him all they can.
Thou too Erato combine,
With all the chorus of the Nine:
Sing of GEORGE in honour drest,
Tow'ring vict'ry for His crest,
Whom the bounteous Powers above
Have blest with CHARLOTTE and with Love.
Yet why your Presence do I ask,
Full glad of such a welcome task?
Why  call I You to Britain's plain?
To bid You leave it would be vain.

But now each British bosom fraught
With all the warmth that Love e'er taught
Still prays (and may their Pray'rs prevail)
That Britain's blessings ne'er may fail.
We ask not of the Pow'rs above
Britain's blessings to improve.
