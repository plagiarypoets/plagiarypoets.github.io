He stood &mdash; earth's mightiest rampart gain'd at length,
Where, proudly rising with its crest of snow,
The rifted mountain rears its giant strength,
In stern defiance of the tempests' blow:
Above him shine the eternal heavens below,
The avalanche thunders from the yielding steep;
And with wild voice, ascending as they flow
From rock to rock, the maddened waters leap,
To hide their sullen wrath, where night and horror sleep.

A thousand are at hand &mdash; the warlike boast
Of sultry Afric's yet unbending pride,
Dark-featured leaders of that countless host
Which throngs from echoing wood and torrent's side&mdash;
Numidia's horseman, swift and falcon-eyed;
The fierce Getulian, with his lance of cane,
Thy chosen, queenly Carthage!  peril-tried;
Joined with the gleaming helms, and blades of Spain;
And, like a breathing flood, fair Gaul's embattled train.

Before him, in the fading distance, lies
Italia &mdash; glorious as a summer-dream,
With fields which laugh beneath those cloudless skies;
And haunted grove, and ever tuneful stream;
And hills, where, brightening in the sportive beam,
The vine's light gems their liquid hues unfold;
And all that meets the vision might beseem
The guiltless time by poets sung of old,
Ere banished Saturn fled, and waned his age of gold.

On, Warrior, on!  even now thy dread career
Demands thee.  Trebia's dim and wintry day,
And Thrasimene with her lake of fear,
And that red plain and desolating fray,
When War's avenging Deity shall lay
Rome's first and proudest as the nameless low;
And Tiber, winding on his rippling way,
Shall hear the midnight wail ascending slow
From lips which breathe despair &mdash; a nation's cry of wo!

A light is on thy path of danger now,
Where Hope, the phantom, iris-throned appears:
A little while, and that forsaken brow
Shall droop &mdash; though not beneath the weight of years;
Affliction, anguish, shame, and fruitless tears,
The tyrant's menace, and the poisoned bowl:
Alas!  not such the pile which Fancy rears
Within the workings of the lofty soul
Which spreads o'er subject earth its measureless control.
