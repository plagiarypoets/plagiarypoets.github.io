How bright was my youth's early morn,
Ere reflection had clouded my brow;
I selected the rose from the thorn,
And was happy, I hardly know how.

I join'd in the sports of the plain,
With rapture I heard the bright song;
In the dance, I was first of the train,
And was gayest among the gay throng.

'Tis true, my heart oft breath'd a sigh,
But it rose from mild pity alone;
If a tear sometimes stray'd from my eye,
It flow'd not for griefs of its own.

No sorrow corroded my heart,
No falsehood awakened a fear;
For my bosom, a stranger to art,
Believ'd every friend was sincere.

But ah!  these fair visions of youth,
Disappointment has chas'd from my mind;
And the friends, whom I fancied all truth,
Alas!  can be sometimes unkind.

I have seen the bright azure of morn,
With darkness and clouds shadow'd o'er;
I have found that the rose has a thorn,
Which will wound, when its bloom is no more.

The sigh, that from sympathy rose,
Now heaves not for others alone;
And the tear, as it silently flows,
Confesses a source of its own.
