Warton, whilst led by fairy heads unseen,
With pilgrim step undaunted you explore
Each desert cave, each lone untrodden scene,
Of wild Antiquity's romantic shore;
Oh!  may the musings of my busy soul
With thee thro' untry'd regions fearless stray,
Where the pale Wizard with his dark'ning scroll,
Reluctant Time, on thy advent'rous way
Scowls baffled &mdash; Shall wan Envy's with'ring form,
Like the fell Daemon of th' enchanted hall,
Tho' swelling with dark hand the bidden storm,
Thy daring soul's proud purposes appall?
E'en here shall Truth rise in her own dread state,
And scare the shrinking eye of vain-resisting Hate.
