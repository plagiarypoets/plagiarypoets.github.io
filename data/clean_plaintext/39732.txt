Observe the Rose-Bud e'er it blows,
While the Dawn glimmers o'er the Sky!
Observe its silken Leaves unfold,
As fond of Day's majestic Eye!
At Noon, more bold, in fullest Bloom,
It spreads a Gale of Sweets around;
At Eve it mourns the setting Sun,
And sheds its Honours on the Ground.

So Beauty's bashful Bud appears,
So blushes in the Eye of Praise:
So ripens in the Noon of Life,
And wither'd so in Age decays.
Time is the Canker-Worm of Youth,
It bites the Blossom as it grows,
It blasts the Flow'r that blooms at full,
And rudely sheds the falling Rose.

See, Beauty, see!  how Love and Joy
On Youth's light Pinions haste away;
How swift the Moments glide along,
And Age advances with Delay!
Now, Beauty!  crop the Rose-Bud new,
And catch the Essence as it flies;
Let Pleasure revel in its Bloom,
Let Time possess it when it dies.
