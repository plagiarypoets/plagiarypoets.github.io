Turne, gentle straunger!  turne awhyle!
And list unto my plainte,
I loste my harte to a damzell fayre,
Whome I fancy'd was a saynte.

I thoughte her mynde was lyke her face,
In perfect beautie drest;
I thoughte her harte was framed sincere,
And spotlesse as her breste.

Her eie was lyke the morninge starr,
And lyke the rose her cheeke,
Her smyle was gaye as summer skies,
Her manner chaste and meeke.

Oft by the margent of the brook
That neare her dwellinge flow'd,
I used to meete the peerless mayde,
For whome my busome glow'd.

When with a coronal of flowers
I deck'd her heben haire,
Proud as the pavone of its plumes,
Wou'd Brassolis appeere.

But dire commotions shooke the lande,
And marr'd the hopes of love;
A soldier bred, I led my bande
The toils of warr to prove.

"Retire, my Brassolis!"  I cry'd,
"Avoyde the warfull playne,
And in a convent safe abide,
Till peace shall smyle agayne."

The artfull fayre appeer'd to grieve,
And slowlie to departe;
Her persaunt eie I dar'd beleeve
The herald of her harte.

The red-cross banner soone prevayl'd,
The crescent proudlie shone,
Victorious shouts our ears regal'd,
And valourous deeds were done.

The battle o'er, I chaunc'd to see
A palmer on the fielde,
Whose whole attention seem'd to be
Fix'd on my silver shielde.

He wore a garberdine of gray,
With cockle shells enlay'd,
Red sandals were upon his feet,
A bonnet on his head.

I parley'd with this palmer gray,
And a letter to hym gave,
I pray'd hym seeke my bonny bride,
And meete me at the cave.

And thus I wrote, "Our conquering bande
Are with fresh laurels crown'd,
And in the archives of the lande
Their deeds will be renown'd.

"But tho' a soldier's cares detaine
Thy faithful lover here,
The hours are yeeres till I agayne
See Brassolis appeere.

"No signs of warr will paine thy sighte,
The sword is caste asyde,
And victory, in laurels dight,
Woos my betrothed bryde.

"Farewell to bassonet and speare,
To hauberk, launce, and glaive:
The olive tree is planted here,
And waves o'er yonder cave.

"Come then, my love!  and join me here;
A palfrey I provyde,
A pilgrim will this message beare,
Who swears to be thy guide."

I sent this letter to the mayde,
And told the pilgrim gray
His service largely shou'd be paid,
Then bade hym haste away.

The palmer these credentials tooke,
My benison I gave&mdash;
I trusted to hys honest looke,
And to hys habit grave.

But the false mayde for whome I sigh'd
Was fashion'd to betraye,
She, tho' affianced for my bryde,
Fled with the palmer gray.

Ungrateful Brassolis!  I mourne
My own credulity,
And in my busome beare a wounde
That knows no remedie.

Ensample sad to all mankinde
My riven harte may prove,
And teache them to escape the pangs
Of ill-requited love.
