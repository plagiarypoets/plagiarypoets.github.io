In writing long, and reading works of warre,
That Homer wrote and Virgils verse did show:
My muse me led in overweening farre,
When to their Stiles my pen presumde to goe.
Ovid himselfe durst not have vaunted so,
Nor Petrarke grave with Homer would compare:
Dawnt durst not think his sence so hye did flow,
As Virgils works that yet much honord are.
Thus each man sawe his judgement hye or low,
And would not strive or seeke to make a jarre:
Or wrastle where they have an overthrow.
So I that finde the weakenes of my bow,
Will shoot no shaft beyond my length, I troe:
For reason learnes and wisdome makes me know,
Whose strength is best and who doth make or marre:
A little Lamp may not compare with Starre,
A feeble head where no great gifts doo grow,
Yeelds unto skill, whose knowledge makes smal shew.
Then gentle world I sweetly thee beseech:
Call Spencer now the spirit of learned speech.
