Next a fair form with modest gestures came,
Whose eyes were glist'ning with a lambent flame,
Gently she took the Harp, such as of yore,
The hallow'd Hebrew monarch bore,
And seem'd to touch it with a hand divine.
An awful silence soon prevail'd around,
Yet awe with pleasure was immingling found,
As if the sounds were from Religion's shrine.
When asked her name, she with a blush confest
'Twas LOVE, and then she ventur'd to protest
SHE only could inspire the female breast:
Declaring man felt not her purer fire,
But rather the wild flame of loose desire.
She claim'd from SERAPHIM her high descent,
And said her constant effort where she went,
Was still to regulate man's grosser kind,
And touch their breasts with sympathies refin'd,
That all on earth might know 'twas only LOVE
Could give a foretaste of the bliss above.
Truth then advanc'd from Music's simple cell,
For Truth with Harmony is fond to dwell,
Proclaiming LOVE, above all worldly art,
And scorning fabled CUPID'S pointless dart,
Chose her pure mansion in the female heart.
