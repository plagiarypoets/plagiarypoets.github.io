So soon does memory perish with the dead!
'Tis buried with their ashes in the tomb:
Why rears the pyramid its lofty head,
Like an immortal tower, defying doom,
Even amid the desert? &mdash; say for whom?
Will the proud Monarch, wrapped in painted cloth,
Sleep more securely in that spacious room
Than the poor beggar's in his grave?  The moth
And worm know no respect, but feed like on both.
