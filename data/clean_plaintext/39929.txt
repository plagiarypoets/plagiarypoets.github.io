The sea-bird skims along the silvery tide,
And screams full oft her shrill discordant lay,
While the tired boatmen their frail shallops guide
To the safe shelter of the neighboring by,
As evening shades fall down with mantle grey&mdash;
Shrouding the distant abbey's ivied tower,
Then slowly deep'ning as the sun's last ray
Leaves the sad Hermit's lonely mountain bower&mdash;
Hastening the time when village maidens dream,
And Lovers stroll beside the babbling stream.

Now the blithe ploughman whistles on the moor,
As to his humble cot he wends his way&mdash;
While the clean housewife watches at the door,
And jocund urchins on the wide lawn play,
Unconscious of the late departed day&mdash;
Chasing the fire-fly by the dasied tomb;
Then swiftly fleeing from some lovely Fay,
Wander along amid the murky gloom,
And soon are safe within their parent's arms,
Who, in their joy, forget their first alarms.

At length the bell sends forth its warning sound,
From the dark abbey's venerable tower;
And now the cottage inmates gather round,
(For lo! &mdash; it tells the evening service hours,)
To hear the Ploughman praise his Maker's power&mdash;
Checking each childish deed or mirthful sound;
Then, weary, in their heathery beds they cower,
While midnight's awful silence spreads around,
Unbroken, save by the hoarse mastiff's bay,
Until the cock's shrill note proclaims the day.
