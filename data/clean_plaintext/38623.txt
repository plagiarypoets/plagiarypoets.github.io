Hail, ancient tow'rs!  long nodding o'er the plain,
Whose lofty pile salutes the western sky;
Thy stately pride, alas!  is all in vain,
No more thy walls the siege of time defy.

In vain thy greatness claims thy country's care,
To noble wealth thou idly dost complain,
The murm'ring dome sighs to the empty air,
Nor Lord nor Muse awake thy ancient fame.

Beneath thy roof, in days of former years,
The princely guests pass'd round the cheering bowl;
Oft hath thy sure retreat suppress'd the fears,
Oft quell'd the tumults of the royal soul.

Alas, no more! &mdash; Where now thy JAMES'S train?
Thy DOUGLAS, RANDOLPH?  Where thy Barons bold?
For thee fair MARY soon had lost a name,
Had not a STUART all her story told.

Within the halls, where many a banquet pass'd,
In echoing domes, where RIZZIO tun'd his strings,
The hungry jay devours his rude repast,
The lonely turtle coos in plaintive strains.

No more thy courts sound to the lawyer's tale,
Nor busy orators their peals diffuse;
The owls, loud howling, now in turn prevail,
The noble throng are in the narrow house.

Thy church no more the gaudy mass beholds,
No swelling pomp her sacred roofs resound;
Nor ghost shall warn a JAMES from FLODDEN fields,
Nor more shall CREIGHTON be to penance bound.
