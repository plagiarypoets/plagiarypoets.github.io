The Cestus, which the graces wove,
And laughing Venus wore,
Where centered all the power of love,
By which all lovers swore.

Has been to various charms compared,
In various figures drest;
And thus the sentimental bard
His tender creed confess'd:

'Tis Sympathy's resistless tears,
Which melt the stubborn heart;
Awake a thousand anxious fears,
A thousand joys impart.

Such childish transports I despise,
(Exclaim'd a sprightlier swain,)
And Wit must revel in those eyes
Which give my bosom pain.

Hold, (said the philosophic sage)
'Tis Wisdom I aver,
Which charms mankind in every age;
I pay my vows to her.

Thus vainly have they oft explored
The mental catalogue;
And ev'ry beauty been adored,
And ev'ry grace in vogue.

Unweeting bards!  who thus insult
Their godships' finer taste;
And think that they, on charms occult,
Etherial sighs would waste.

For, if their breasts (as poets tell)
With mortal passions glow,
Not even Beauty's potent spell
Could deal the fatal blow.

The little tyrant of the skies
Had pass'd unheeded by,
Nor the soft lustre of her eyes
Been honor'd with a sigh.

Then, if aright I ween, this zone
(Which woke the plaintive verse,
And triumph'd o'er the heart of stone,)
Was but a simple purse.

Nay, do not rave, ye whimpering swains,
And talk of love sincere;
For all your extacies and pains
Concentre only here.

Could you but learn the happy art,
By Midas known of old;
You'd e'en transform the fair one's heart
And ev'ry nerve to gold.
