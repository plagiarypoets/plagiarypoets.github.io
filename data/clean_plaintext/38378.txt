CICELY.
Ah well-a-day, in this same gap,
I lately sat in Cuddy's lap,
Cuddy, the neatest, blythest, swain,
That e'er tripp'd featly o'er our plain:
He's gone, and left me here forlorne,
Ah woe is me!  I deeply mourn;
The tears flow trickling from each eye,
So fast, I sure shall weep them dry:
He's gone I ween to meet with Sue,
Ah!  what mun slighted Cicely do?

But see, o'er yonder hill I spy,
Is it not Cuddy's coming nigh?
I'll run and meet him with a kiss,
Sure Cuddy'l ne'er take that amiss.

CUDDY.
What Cicely!  how I joy to see
My pretty Cicely meeting me:
Have I, my Cicely, still thy heart,
Or does some other share a part?
Thy Cuddy's faithful still, and true,
May I hope Cicely is so too?

CICELY.
Sly Cuddy, how does Sukey fare?
She has your love &mdash; You've none to spare.

CUDDY.
Whom?  Sukey!  The poor silly creature
Has neither wit, nor beauteous feature.
First view thyself &mdash; then think of she,
Who spreads as wide as o'ergrown tree.
No surely, &mdash; I've a better taste,
Why I can span my Cicely's waist,
Then who wou'd Cice for Sue forsake
A greyhound might for hedge-hog take.

CICELY.
Ah, Cuddy, don't deceive me there,
I ne'er did you, I vow and swear.
Ha'st got my buckles in your shoe,
Or han you gave them happier Sue?

CUDDY.
Han you my garter on your knee?
Sweet lovely Cicely, let me see.

CICELY.
Fye, Cuddy, fye, no rudeness shew,
I'll ne'er admit it, that you know.
Ha'st got, my Cud, thine oaten reed?
Let's both go sit in yonder mead,
We'll play, and sing, a roundelay,
And spend most chearfully the day;
My good old dame left me some pelf,
And Cud shal have it all himself,
If he to me, will ween his plight,
We'll both live happy, day, and night.
