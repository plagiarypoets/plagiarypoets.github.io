I have not wandered with unheeding eye,
Midst nature's marvels; I have sought to blend
My mind with what I gazed on, and to pry
Into the hidden worth of charms, that lend
A loveliness to earth; my soul would rend
The cloud that veils our vision, and behold
The inward gaze and glory that transcend
Our farthest thought of beauty; see unroll'd
Creation's page, and mark &mdash; what truths are brightly told.

And never did there meet my gladdened glance,
A wonder more awakening than the sight
Of that cloud-mingling mountain, on which dance
The dying splendours of the sun-set light
That gilds the glowing west; the icy height
Seems crown'd with roses, momently they fade,
As deeper sinks the day-star, but his flight
Flings hues more tender still, than first arrayed
The ensky'd snows that here a heavenly hand hath laid.

And now those tints are vanished, with the rays
That gave them borrowed being, and now crowd
Before us the pale vapours; day decays
More palpably.  A cold uncoloured cloud
Spreads sadly o'er the giant-crag a shroud
Dimensionless; the evening shadows fall
And find us still to contemplation vowed;
For death had darkened over us, and the pall
Of our own pensive thoughts at length envelops all!
