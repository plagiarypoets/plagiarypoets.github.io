Haste, O Fair!  and with thee bring
Many a little venom'd Sting;
Many a Tale that no one knows,
Of shall-be-nameless Belles and Beaux,
Just-imported Curtain Lectures,
Winks, and Nods, and shrewd Conjectures;
Half a Dozen strange Suspicions,
Built on stranger Suppositions;
Unknown Marriages, some twenty,
And Horns just fitted to some People's Heads,
And certain powder'd Coats, and certain tumbled Beds!
