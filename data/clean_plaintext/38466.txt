Immers'd in the vale of Despair,
Despondent and pensive I stray,
No pleasures contented I share,
No more can be joyous and gay;
Adieu then ye eglantine bow'rs,
Ye groves and ye vallies so fine;
Adieu ye sweet shrubs and ye flow'rs,
Thro' sadness your charms I resign.

Adieu all ye sports of the plain,
No more your diversions invite;
Adieu to the pastoral strain,
As now it ne'er yields me delight:
Adieu to my pipe and my crook,
My sheep and my lambkins adieu!
All pastime your shepherd's forsook,
Nor longer is watchful of you.

Adieu ye sweet birds of the vale,
No more in assemblage ye please;
No more I attend to your tale,
Since I am deprived of ease:
For Phillis has left me in woe,
And calls me a wretch of disdain;
I'm jeer'd too wherever I go,
Thro' the jest that she makes of my pain.

But oh!  was she like me distrest,
By a youth who to her was unkind,
She'd pity the pangs in my breast,
To give some relief to my mind:
Nor thus overwhelm me with care,
Nor smile as dejected I rove,
Nor cause me to pine and despair,
And die a poor victim to love!
