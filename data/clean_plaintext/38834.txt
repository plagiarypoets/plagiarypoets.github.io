Hush'd is the voice of War, and o'er the ground
Sits deathlike Silence, brooding, dark, and deep;
Save where low groans, or dying pray'rs resound,
Or Sorrow faintly shrieks, too sad to weep;

Save where, the rav'ning Vulture screaming by,
Propt on his sword the pensive Veteran bends,
And, Nature speaking in his pensive eye,
Guards the pale relics of his slaughter'd Friends.

Fall'n are the Chiefs who claim'd the van of fight,
Whose hearts beat high, and, as the orient ray
Flash'd mimic light'nings from their falchions bright,
Panted for Glory, and a deathful day.

Yet shall their Spirits live, and, hov'ring near,
With the blest flame of Patriot Valour glow,
And oft their aery shapes shall scatter fear
At eve of Battle, thro' the shudd'ring Foe.

But in the Britons, firm to ancient faith,
Shall they not breathe the soul of Loyalty?
Bid the sword leap spontaneous from the sheath,
Bid Vengeance arm, for Heav'n and Liberty?

Yes, deathless Souls! &mdash; and round your honour'd bier
Affection's pleasing tribute oft shall flow:
A sad Memorial shall your Country rear,
Deck'd with the Trophies of Sepulchral Woe.

There shall your FRED'RIC hang the Sculptur'd Urn
With living Laurel, and the Cypress gloom;
Revers'd the Flag of Victory shall mourn,
And Honour's blade lie drooping on your Tomb.

There shall the war-worn Vet'ran oft repair,
And, as he reads your Story, trac'd by truth,
A smile shall brighten thro' the falling tear,
And his old veins glow with the fire of youth.

"'Tis but a pang, that shakes our mortal frame,
'Tis but a blow," the hoary Chief shall cry;
"Then shall this Spirit mount on wings of flame,
This Body sleep, with these, in Peace and Victory."
