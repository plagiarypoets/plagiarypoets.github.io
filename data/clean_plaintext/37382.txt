Again has Edwin left his native bowers,
The bowers of innocence, again returning
To spend the dull and melancholy hours
Where study's pale and lonely lamp is burning.
Years of his youth how rapidly ye fled
In that beloved home, when fancy's power
Its magic tints o'er youthful visions shed,
And gave a deeper hue to every flower
He fancied he should crop in Manhood's day;
Not thinking that so fair a form so soon would fade away.

Alas the flower has faded, even now
Cold disappointment's hand his bosom chilling,
Her melancholy impress on his brow
Has stamped, his youthful heart with sorrow filling.
