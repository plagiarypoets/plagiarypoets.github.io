While you, dear Paulus, sacrifice your rest,
To plead in noisy courts for worth distress'd;
Or, bold in senates for the public cause,
Revive our injur'd country's dying laws;
Watch o'er the growth of pow'r with zealous eye,
And unexcis'd preserve our liberty:
From all the vanities of life retir'd
To Cam's fair banks, where Spenser lay inspir'd,
I read with rapture Homer's sacred page,
Whose strong description glows with martial rage.
Whose nervous lines, with wisdom fraught, impart
Those virtues, which adorn or mend the heart;
With greater force the moral rules explain,
Than Whitfield's cant, or Clarke's pathetic strain.
But, lest you think this doctrine too severe,
My reasons, Paulus, if at leisure, hear.
Fair Helen's charms, that kindled fierce desire
In Paris' breast, and set the world on fire,
For ever bloom in his immortal strains,
Whose fable with such energy contains
The zeal of foolish monarchs mad with pride,
The mob's wild tumult, like a rapid tide. . . .
