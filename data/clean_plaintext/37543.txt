Some lovely fair, whose unaffected charms
Shone with attraction to herself unknown,
Whose beauty might have blest a monarch's arms,
And virtue cast a lustre on the throne:

That humble beauty warm'd an honest heart,
And chear'd the labours of a faithful spouse;
That virtue form'd, for every decent part,
The healthful offspring that adorn'd their house.
