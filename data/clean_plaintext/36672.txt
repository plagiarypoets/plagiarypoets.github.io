'Twas at this Time my Knowledge of the Man
And my Compassion for his State began.
This I related with my Wish to raise
His fallen Mind by Views of brighter Days;
To me the Symptoms of his Case were known,
Signs of the Disease that Once had been my own.
I strove to soothe him, Chose him Books, and read,
But his Desire and Love of Truth were fled.
He neither granted nor denied the Proof
Of Man's true State!  but would reply, "Enough!
It may be so!  but all is dark to me.
I've neither Power to argue, nor t' agree."
Yet he could sometimes speak in cheerful Style,
And small Events would cause a transcient Smile,
But an attempt his wayward Mind to guide
Disturbed his Temper and provoked his Pride.
He talked of Death, but, as it then appear'd,
There were in him no Symptoms to be feared.
"Temperance and Care," I said, "will Health restore."
"For what?," said he, "My comforts live no more,
And when our Dwelling we no longer love,
What Law on Earth forbids us to remove?"
To this I answer'd from my common Place:
"Who quits his Post is sure to meet Disgrace."
"Disgrace with Whom?"  said David, "shall the Dread
Of babling Malice pain the happy Dead?
Will Spencer sang, 'When weary Mortals die,
Let none ask How, or whence, or where, or Why.'"
Smiling he spoke, and earnest I replied:
"The Poet's Verse is not the Sinner's Guide."
And thus we parted &mdash; "Think not I forget,"
He said, "your Kindness, 'tis One pleasing Debt,
And proves there's Love in Man." &mdash; My Leave I took,
And left poor David to his Bed and Book. . . .
