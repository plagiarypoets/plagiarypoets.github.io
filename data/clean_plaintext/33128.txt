So ringe the peale of love, truith, justice out,
As it, into theire choire, all heerers chime;
So cease the belles, of discordes dismal rowt,
As it entewne this harmonie divine;
So virtues flame woold loves sweete lampe entine,
As Chaucer, Lidgate, Sidney, Spencer dead,
Yett livinge swanns, singe out what thow haste sedd?
