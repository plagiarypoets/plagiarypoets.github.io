THE EXILE.  PART FIRST.
"Aye, the bright sun will rise; in glory rise,
And all the heavens be filled with yellow light,
And balmy dew-mists of the summer skies
Wake notes of rapture, odours of delight;
But shall he rise on those green canopies
Of wild-wood gay, that wont to charm my sight?
O no!  the lovely scenes are gone for aye;
For ever quench'd, and cold, Imagination's ray.

"And on my vitals pain with ceaseless sway
Preys like the secret canker in the flower,
Wasting unseen my life and hopes away,
Barring the gates of Fame's immortal bower
And on my path attend both night and day
A train of demons that my heart devour,&mdash;
Anger, and Shame, and Disappointment fell,
And dire Despondency, &mdash; relentless fiends of hell.

"But oh the lovely scenes that I have known!
Not all Imagination's witchery,
When seated radiant on her sapphire throne,
Can equal Nature's fair reality;
Nor of high-pealing instruments the tone
E'er match'd the notes of heaven-taught harmony,
When purple gleams and fall of fragrant dew
Warn the gay choirs at morn their descant to renew.

"Gone, gone are these; and Guilt and Misery
Are my companions now where'er I go;
And former joys, that did so swiftly flee,
To recollection brought, but mock my woe."
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Thus mid the scenery desolate and drear;
The Exile mourn'd, poor man!  for Memory
In vivid colours bade the groves appear
That never more would greet his longing eye;
While the dim ghosts of early transports dear
Gave tenfold keenness to his agony.
On the lone shore he stray'd, and woo'd the gale
Chill breathing o'er the waves of ocean pale.

But, sudden, as he trod the sandy shore,
By force resistless was he borne away;
And memory, thought, and sight return'd no more
Till he was floating on the ocean gray
In a strange bark, impell'd by sail and oar,
Where sat the wonted comrades of his way:
And far receded from his sight the strand;
And torments fresh awoke that he might not withstand.

O ghostly, ghostly was that vessel's crew;&mdash;
There Apprehension sat, and Pain and Woe,
And as their course through ocean they pursue,
Despair himself uprearen at the prow.
On the wide waves the Exile bent his view,
And torpor o'er his senses 'gan to flow;
(Not the sweet calm of hope-restoring sleep,)
For now the winds awoke the horrors of the deep.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Despair, that sat him on the vessel's prow,
Uprearen his gaunt arms into the air,
And with a shout that echoed high and low,
Seem'd some compeer from hell to summon there.
Straight at the sound the rising might you know
Of a strange light, that danced with fearful glare,
But far remote yet seem'd the mystic ray,
But onwards swiftly still pursued its lonely way.

Amid the clouds of lurid ghastly hue
That light came dancing o'er the ocean swell
Who bore it, by Saint Bride, I never knew,
But, sooth to say, he had his birth in hell.
It overhung the bark, it inward drew&mdash;
Then from the Exile burst a feeble yell,
For in his brain at once that hellish light,
Like lightning buried quick, evanish'd from the sight.

Then in the sufferer's brain that horrid fire
The marrow dried; and now no more the ray
Of reminiscence, that had wont to inspire
Thoughts of the long-lost joys that once had sway,
Remain'd, &mdash; but all was ruin, madness dire,
And Fancy's wild creations died away.&mdash;
Nought, nought remain'd, but pain's o'erpowering sense
From that accursed fire's keen influence.

On, on they go, &mdash; that vessel and her crew,&mdash;
Her ghastly crew and their unhappy prey;&mdash;
On, on they float, &mdash; o'er waves of murky hue;&mdash;
Down sank the darkening clouds on ocean gray,
And tenfold night her mantle o'er them drew,
And phantom shapes arose in dread array.&mdash;
How long they sail'd now 'fits me not to tell&mdash;
Leave we the Knight awhile with those dread fiends of hell.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

It is the balm of an autumnal breeze,&mdash;
A breeze that floats o'er fading leaves and flowers,
It is no chilling night-gale from the seas,&mdash;
It is the fragrance of autumnal bowers,
The breath of lingering verdure on the trees
Woke by the fall of morning dews or showers.
O happy hour! &mdash; that gale renew'd again
The long-lost calmness of the sufferer's brain.

The fire was quench'd, and slowly now the ray
Of reason 'gan return.  O happy hour!
The clouds and storms of night have lost their sway;
The tranquil sunbeams on the waters shower
Their influence sweet; the fiends have fled away,
Awed by the presence of some heavenly power.
He sees it is the sun &mdash; the smiling sea&mdash;
And feels the happy gales restore serenity.

Listen!  O listen! &mdash; 'tis no earthly strain;
It is the voice of angels from the sky
Hymning the praise of God &mdash; the billowy main
Is hushed to hear that sacred harmony.
Listen!  O listen! &mdash; for the sounds again
In thousand blended notes arise on high.
O 'tis the voice of seraphs on the deep,
Calling the sufferer from his painful sleep.

If e'er at morn, when odorous dews of night
Rest on the woods, thy slumber has been broke
By thousand songsters to the radiance bright
Chaunting their homage from some wooded rock,
And thou hast felt the thrills of pure delight,
And blest the birds that thee from sleep awoke,
Then, though that sound with this may not compare,
Yet thou shalt know what songs of angels are.

For mark the man in whom each simplest sound,
And simplest sight in Nature's treasury,
With genuine fulness of delight hath crown'd,
That man can taste the sweets of poesy:
And none but such can tell what joys abound
When angels wake unearthly melody.
Tell not of drums and clarions echoing far&mdash;
These are deceitful arts to hide the woes of war.

And such a man l knew, whose common talk
Fitting itself unto the base and low,
(Alas!  and all that in his daily walk
Him cross'd were such) no genius e'er did shew,
But ever moved in the most beaten track;
But when alone, immortal flowers would blow
Round his wild path, and heavenly lustre stream,
Till common cares again dispell'd the magic dream.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

The Knight beholds the sun, the smiling sea,
And looks around him on the waters blue,
And he is not alone; the brilliancy
Of sun-light gives a lovely form to view,
That steers the vessel onward in her glee,
The while the western breezes gently blew;
That form was FORTITUDE, a mighty dame,
Of lofty rank in all the rolls of Fame.

But now, up rose an island to the sight,
Whence came the balmy odours of the air;
For though that island, in the yellow light,
Shew'd nought at first but grey rocks rude and bare,
Yet there were fields of waving harvest bright,
And dells of wildwood scattered here and there,
Within the boundaries of that magic land,
Wherein the peerless dame that steer'd the vessel reign'd.

High were the rocky cliffs that frowning rose,
Whereon the tranquil autumn sun display'd
The lichen grey on sternest brow that grows.
And tall hypericum, not yet decay'd.
But now the scenes fresh wonders 'gan disclose,
As from the vessel to the shore convey'd,
Awhile the Exile on the strand alone
Gazed onthe sights of joy and woe that thence were strewn.

For, through a deep ravine thence might he view
A distant prospect of a goodly scene;
But painful was the path that valley through,
And many a lurking danger lay between
The wanderer and the fields of lovely hue,
That crown'd the distant landscape most serene,
Rock, shattered pine, morass, and water-fall
Were there, his sinking spirits to appal.

Nor earthly barrier only met him there;
For lurking demons ever and anon
Grasp'd at their former prey; and many a snare
Contrived, by which the Knight might be o'erthrown
Yet ever and anon, amid the air
Was heard the swell of some celestial tone;
And the bright glance of wings "bedropt with gold"
Compell'd the demons to forego their hold.

As nigh the lake, yclep'd the Lake of Hell,
By Scottish bard extoll'd in deathless day,
A glen there is, the abode of satyrs fell,
Oft seen by shepherd swain at close of day,
Unscar'd by holy sound of vesper bell,
Half heard from far Inchmahon's old abbaye&mdash;
The Coir nan Uriskin, that strange valley hight;
St Mary, guard the swain that wanders there by night!

Aye, joy inspired him, even 'mid all his care;
For still he mark'd the promised landscape gay,
And heard sweet warblings borne along the air,&mdash;
The distant music of the redbreast's lay,
That on the bough, not yet of foliage bare,
Hail'd the soft splendours of the autumn day.
But lo!  his toil is crown'd with mirth at last,
And all the terrors of the way are past.

A palace rose, the abode of Fortitude:
Huge pillars rude of rock the roof upbore;
Within were chambers vast, that Labour hew'd
Within the bowels of the mountain hoar.
There might you penetrate, until renew'd
You heard the voice of ocean on the shore,
Or saw the purple of departing day
O'er the wide azure waves diffuse its lovely ray.

With Fortitude her sister Industry
Oft-times sojourn'd, and frequent might'st thou view
Labour his burden struggling rear on high,
And busy husbandmen their task pursue;
And feeble sufferers wan, with sunken eye,
New guests amid those fields of lovely hue,
Gradual their strength recover, and assay
To glean the scatter'd ears within their grasp that lay.

It was, I ween, a land where Industry
Had most surpassing deeds achieved; for there,
Boon Nature scatter'd not her bounties free:&mdash;
The frowning cliffs were all of verdure bare,
But wheresoe'er the blossom, fair to see,
Of heath or furze perfumed the vernal air,
In every lowly dell that careful Maid
The golden harvest rear'd, or nursed the forest shade.

A kindling vigour in the Exile's frame
Awoke, what-while he breathed the charmed air,
That from the fields of yellow lustre came,
Where troops of labourers and maidens fair,
The guerdon of their former toil to claim,
Went gaily forth autumnal sweets to share.
Such pleasant sights the fleeting day beguiled,
When first the Wanderer gain'd the rocky region wild.

Befits me not in lengthen'd song to tell
The varied pleasures of fair Autumn's reign;
For they are sung by Wootton's bard  so well,
That none shall e'er achieve such lays again;
And, save that master of the charmed shell, 
None e'er achieved, &mdash; who sang in deathless strain
Each varying season's blissful influence,
And magic realms of wizard Indolence.

But when the last enchanting scenes were o'er
Of many-coloured groves and yellow rays,
And clouds had settled on the mountains hoar,
Then did the Exile spend the shortening days
In listening to the mighty ocean's roar,
And cataracts that wintry tempests raise,
And the long hours of cheerless darkness wore
In calling mighty spirits from the grave,
Of many an errant knight and stern crusader brave.

THE EXILE.  PART SECOND.
Lonely he wandered on the sea-beat shore;&mdash;
Watching the sportive billows all alone
Wandered the Knight:  the fragrant gales upbore
The waves that in the cheering sunbeam shone,
And chafed their summits into fringes hoar,
As o'er the wide waste they came dancing on.
The knight that wandered on the lonely shore
Felt the sweet scene his long-lost ecstasy restore.

Aye; fragrant were the gales that on him blew;
It was the blessed breath of May that rose,
And o'er the waters of cerulean hue
Her influence brought of pleasure and repose;
And now his heart was filled with gladness new,
And new-born ardour in his bosom glows.
O lovely were the scenes around him strewn,
Lovelier than aught that he had looked upon.

For o'er that island height a wilderness
Of flowers arose; the furze was all in bloom,
And with most brilliant colouring did dress
The rugged cliffs and shed a rich perfume,
While the eye mark'd from many a wild recess
The happy fields a vivid green assume;
And the fair forests waving in their pride
On the slope shelter of the mountain side.

But who can tell that influence divine
That lives and operates on each living thing,
When the first fragrant southern gales benign
Awake the sleeping energies of spring?
When all the woodland choir anew combine
The song of joy and gratitude to sing,
And leaf and blossom bursting into bloom,
Load every passing gale with exquisite perfume?

Hark!  'tis the cuckoo's magic voice aloud,
And all the rocky scenes around him ring!&mdash;
Scared at the music of that warning proud,
In Iceland grot impervious to the spring,
Stern Winter hastes his withered form to shroud.
Thereon, the happy nymphs and labourers bring
The freshest garlands from the wildest wood
To deck the rocky shrine of FORTITUDE.

But as on Rona's melancholy isle,
That mirthful voice still wakes the chords of woe;
And banishes of youth and age the smile,
So now, succeeding to that voice did flow
A tide of mournful thoughts!  and for a while
Lost to the scene the Knight was wandering slow;
Till sudden to his sight an aged man
On the lone sea-shore to appear began.

Scarce seemed that bending form so shook by age,
As by the inward force of fantasy,
That, painting woes that nothing might assuage,
Him stung more keenly than Reality;
For still he seemed as blotted from the page
Of sinners that shall ever pardoned be,
And nought unto his harassed brain was given
But dreams of crime and woe, and stern unpitying Heaven.

And APPREHENSION hight, this woeful man
Where'er he went did blast each lovely thing;
For, as he walked, the flowers to shrink began,
And shrieking fled the thrush on angry wing.
Unheedful he, now stood, now walked, now ran,
And as an aspen's light leaf trembling,
And by wild weakening fancies ever crost,
Gazed fearfully around, like schoolboy on a ghost.

Aye; from his presence every happy thing
Did shrink; the bright leaves withered on the bough;
And, nearer as he came, the Knight did fling
His frame unnerved upon the sea-beach low;
And, thoughts of woe again quick mustering,
His new-born happiness did all o'erthrow.
But he was rescued from the demons dire,
By FORTITUDE, that marked approach that wicked sire.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

On the sea-shore he wandered till the ray
Of dying day-light 'gan to tinge the wave;
Then sat him down to watch the slow decay
Of pensive twilight from a rocky cave;
But the low murmur of the ocean gray,
And the sweet soothing light such influence gave,
That ere he wist the Knight was lulled to sleep,
And visions o'er his senses 'gan to sweep.

A lovely realm appeared; full well he knew
The fair domain where fled his early years;
And spring had decked the groves in brightest hue,
The scene in all its wonted charms appears,
And seemed fair glittering the dew-mist through,
Gemmed by a vernal morn's refulgent tears.&mdash;
Almost the Knight to tears of joy was moved
To recognize the scenes so earnestly beloved.

Embosomed 'mid the trees a tower arose,
Whereon the purple gleams of morning shone;
And in that tower with swelling heart he knows
The mansion where his sweetest years had flown.
On the wide lake the vernal zephyr blows,
Where first he wept at tales of the renown
Of WALLACE, mighty Chief!  and heaved the sigh
That ever SCOT should bend to slavery.

Then, changing still, the visionary scene
Revealed the castle proud, within whose bowers
The empress of his heart had sheltered been,
While now the sun a cheering lustre pours,
And all the groves are pranked in freshest green,
And the fair gardens filled with brightest flowers.
Anon, alas!  each lovely scene was changed,
And all its hues decayed and order disarranged.

The pleasant sojourn of his Infancy,
The well-known gardens, lake, and mossy tower,
Whereon the sun had shed his brilliancy,
These fell into the stern Invader's power.
Red flames ascending wrapt the tower on high,
And even the verdant forest did devour.
On the fair fields black soot and ashes lay,
A dismal sight, I ween, of ruin and decay.

But now, alas!  yet more of grief appears;
For from the castle proud whose painted bowers
Contained the empress of his heart, in tears
Of bitterness, fast falling down in showers,
And shrieks that filled with agony his ears,
That maiden bright is driven, the sight o'erpowers
His heart with grief so sudden and so keen,
That all at once is closed the visionary scene.

CHILDE ARTHUR.
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
Sweet soothing dreams his weary mind possess'd
Of early days, long past, when all was gay,
And, seated on the mountain's fragrant breast,
He felt the summer gales around him play,
And heard sweet music wooing him to rest;
O lovely was that vision's fair array,
Lovelier than aught that youthful poets dream
Of fairy-land at eve by some romantic stream.

He felt the influence of the blessed sun,
The summer sun that on the scenery shed
His glowing tints, how sweet to look upon!
And clad in partial gleams the mountain's head.
He saw the meads their fairest garb put on,
In hues of green and azure, white, and red,
From whence the passing breezes odours bore
Of power the long-lost thrills of gladness to restore.

He saw the forest's waving canopies
In pride and pomp ascend, and met the gale
Wafting celestial influence through the skies.
He saw the waters gleaming in the vale,
He heard the voice of hound and horn arise,
And sweeter far the blackbird in the dale,
The lone sequestered covert, wake on high
The varied tones of woodland minstrelsy.

He saw the splendours of a smiling sea,
The glassy mirror of the quiet tide,
Whereon reposing in tranquillity,
Gay palaces reflected were espied,
And waving woods, and, sailing on in glee,
Seen double, ship and shadow in their pride,
All these, and more than lay like mine can tell,
He saw, that gave his heart with gratitude to swell.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

But wakening from his trance, O not the swell
Of soothing music met his eager ear;
O not the vernal scenes beloved so well,
Nor sunny gleams around him did appear.
O no!  that comfortless and dismal cell
Had nought the sight to charm, the heart to cheer,
All furred with mouldy damps, and pictured round
With phantom shapes that Pain and Madness bade abound!

Harsh were the grating sounds that drove away
The sweet creations of Childe Arthur's dream;
The clank of chains, the iron hinges bray,
That gave admittance to a transient gleam!
And dire the chill reality whose sway
Assumed the place of Fancy's fairy beam.
How soon like Autumn's foliage are they gone,
The lovely scenes so sweet to look upon!

High in the mouldering wall a grating threw
A tinge of sun-light on the scene below,
And gave Childe Arthur, woful man!  to view
The man who came his pittance to bestow,
That ever loved (what Virtue scorns to do)
To wreak resentment on defenceless foe.
On the faint gleam Childe Arthur fix'd his eye,
As claiming fortitude that malice to defy.

That gleam awoke in Arthur's heart the glow
Of Hope and Virtue and Devotion high:
But that stern keeper did each morning go
Through all the scenes of wild variety,
And saw the purple gleams their influence throw,
Yet felt no love of Nature's majesty;&mdash;
But from the morning air refreshment drew,
His infamous delights more ardent to pursue.

For in that heart where genuine Cruelty
And Treachery innate have their abode,
The scenes that lift the virtuous heart on high
From Nature's loveliness to Nature's God,
But give new fervour to Iniquity,
And aid the shoots of sin to spread abroad.&mdash;
His mirth is wickedness; &mdash; to him the Spring
No joys but such as demons feel can bring.

This Keeper stern that self-same autumn day
Had through the woodland mazes wandering been,
Had seen the sunbeams on the lake waves play,
And partial gleams illume the changing scene;
And from the lovely landscape's fair array,
And the sweet odours of the fading treene,
Like toad or asp or venomed monster foul,
Had but refreshed, I ween, the malice of his soul.

O long and weary was the silent day
To the poor prisoner in that dreary cell:
For him no cheering note of redbreast gay
Was trill'd; nor hunter's horn the breeze did swell.
Stedfast he watched the feeble twilight ray
That through the grated loop-hole slanting fell,
And the chill damp-drops counted, one by one,
That trickled from the roof, and drops upon the stone.

There came a minstrel to the castle gate
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

To him that long in dungeon dark hath lain,
O who can tell how sweet the simplest sight!
The meanest floret on the grassy plain,
The faintest blush of morning's ruddy light!
Thus to the Childe the sylvan scene again
Was destined to arise in radiance bright,
But yet, the night-clouds hung on wood and word,
And frost-fog floated round in banners dense and cold.

The soothing odours of that quiet wood
Rose on his languid frame with influence new;
It was the sweetest haunt of solitude,
And there each Alpine plant and floret grew,
Whose odorous breath long-lost delight renew'd,
And round his tranquil path enchantment threw;
But now the morn with vermeil cheek 'gan rise,
And slow ascending streaks illumed the orient skies.

The varied features of that sylvan scene
Rose 'mid the splendour of the dawning day,
Most lovely to behold; for there, I ween,
Nor art fantastic marr'd the fair array
Of Nature wild; nor ruthless axe had been:
But all was rich and flourishing and gay.
In mazy groups and knolls the wild-wood grew,
(A wilderness of sweets) in many a varied hue.

Heard you the dying fall of music sweet
On the high mountain-summit slow decay?
O will those angel voices not repeat
The heavenly accents of their choral lay?
Have they for ever died? &mdash; O no!  they meet
Again my ravished sense, and steal away
My soul from earthly woes how far! &mdash; O heaven!
Are such enchanting sounds to earthly wanderers given?

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Amid the woodland scene there did appear
An old man bent by time, with hoary hair;
He seemed some venerable bard or seer,
Or hermit grave, or sage medicinayre.
Right courteous to the Childe approaching near.
He told that 'mid that lonely region fair,
Full many a wond'rous grot and cavern lay,
Whither he only knew the secret winding way.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

"O stay, divine illusions, for a while,
Nor let the cold clouds of Reality
Return to check the melancholy smile
With which the well-known regions I descry!
O let the fond remembrances beguile
The silent hours that all too swiftly fly!
So in these fleeting moments I shall know
Even more delight than all the past could e'er bestow!

"Enchantress HOPE!  yet on my senses shed
Your magic treasures!  teach me to pursue
The fond delights of many a former hour,
Too lightly prized, thus living life anew!
Teach me in bold resolves aloft to tower,
And yet to grasp the virtuous honours due,
Whose base usurper's unrelenting chains
So long have galled each nerve, and fired my feverish veins."

Thus, as the hour of matin prime awoke
Childe Arthur from his transitory rest,
Grateful, in accents of delight he spoke,
The-while the bird of autumn blithe exprest
His guiltless raptures from the wooded rock,
Whose simple voice inspired those visions blest!&mdash;
O most transporting is that simple voice
To all whose bosoms pure the woodland scenes rejoice!

Prince Arthur had by basest treachery
Lost the fair kingdom where, in early days,
He reigned in gladness and prosperity,
But memory still would sweet creations raise,
And Hope would paint gay landscapes to his eye,
And with rich hues adorn the woodland maze
Wherein he saw his portraiture displayed,
Rejoicing as of yore amid the well-known shade.

But O!  the fond delusions all were doom'd
Too soon to meet disorder and decay!
For when he would the wild-walk have resumed
To drink the freshness of the new-born day,
While now the rising sun the scene illumed,
He found his frame to sorcery the prey.
That bower was barred by negromantic spell,
That Hermit was, alas!  a minister of hell!
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

A FRAGMENT.
It is the balmy southern breeze that blows
Sweeter than gales of Araby the blest,
Diffusing o'er my frame divine repose,
And soothing each unquiet thought to rest,
A languid calm my wearied fancy knows,
And languid hopes yet linger in my breast,
That, ere I die, some trophy may be won,
Some vision realized, some deed of glory done.

But, oh!  how vain the hope!  the leaf that's borne
On the soft southern breeze is not more frail!
Brief are the cloudless rays that life adorn,
And long and dark the tempests that assail;
And but to struggle on, nor vainly mourn,
Nor o'er inevitable sorrows wail,
Nor cease with ardour virtue to pursue,
Is all that even the best and wisest here may do.

If merry voice of labouring hind, or balm
Of woods autumnal, fields of golden grain,
Could to my harassed mind impart a calm,
Here are they all!  and yet my woes remain!
For ever lost to me the victor's palm,
Me bound, alas!  with adamantine chain
Forged by the fiends, whose unrelenting sway
Bids every youthful hope fast fading meet decay.

Yet, oh!  the softness of that western gale!
It spreads around divine tranquillity!
Though dark the tempest-clouds that life assail,
Yet there are magic gleams of ecstacy!
And ever when the west-vend sweeps the vale,
Fresh Hope is roused and Fancy soars on high,
And recollected visions rise amain,
And legendary lore comes crowding on my brain.

KENNETH.
In dark Glenesk the deer were safe at morn,
And sportive in the copse were seen to play,
Where diamond drops did every leaf adorn,
That glitter'd in the morning's lustre gay;
But loud at noonday rang the hunter's horn:
Anon a merry train in proud array,
To drive the royal deer on mountain ground,
Did thither bend their course with horn and horse and hound.

Long was the chace; befits me not to tell
The varied fortunes of the field that day,
(Who love not on such idle theme to dwell!)
Long was the chace; they drove their panting prey
O'er moor and wood and wold till evening fell,
And twilight died upon the mountain grey,
And dusky clouds rode threatening o'er the sky,
And the rude night-breeze moaned portentously.

Alone at eve amid that heath forlorn
The ROYAL HUNTER urged his venturous way:&mdash;
At length he tarried; and his echoing horn
Resounded 'mid the mountain caverns grey;
But no response was on the breezes borne!
In vain he looked for his attendants gay.&mdash;
All, all alone, amid that mighty wood,
The KING was left in trackless solitude!

And darker clouds their fearful influence shed,
Enormous gloom!  on mountain, lake, and plain,
And heavily on his defenceless trend 
Drove the relentless blast and chilling rain,
While Fancy, with unwonted visions fed,
Dim shapes of terror woke in ceaseless train;
And fears till then his heart had never known
Chilled every shrinking nerve; his esperance was gone.

At length he mark'd a solitary ray
Far in the shadowy void; and with delight,
Though rude and rocky was the dangerous way,
His course he thither urged with all his might.
Ere long a joyful sight did him repay,
For, emanating through the gloom of night,
A dazzling radiance on the scene was cast,
And soothing music rose, and floated on the blast.

O most refulgent was that castle high!
Blazed every traceried arch, and all around
Rung the blithe notes of mirth and revelry,
And courteous welcome now his wishes crown'd.
Within were scenes enchanting to the eye,
For melting dames in every bower were found,
And rich repast and goblets brimmed with wine,
And music's purer charms the senses did refine.

Midnight; but who 'mid those delightful bowers
E'er long'd for sleep!  their mirth seem'd ever new;&mdash;
But sudden thunder shook the castle towers,
And every smiling dame grew pale of hue;
Anon unearthly horror all o'erpowers;
From pale their cheeks were changed to livid blue!
And with demoniac shrieks they vanish'd all!
Only the LADY-HOST remain'd within the hall.

"Relentless Tyrant!  lo!  thine hour is come!
The youth whose guiltless life was reft by thee
For vengeance cries from his untimely tomb.
Relentless king!  for thee no game nor glee
Shall ever more awake!  Behold thy doom,
Fit guerdon for thy reckless cruelty!"&mdash;
Then with a shout that mighty dame hath fled&mdash;
Anon the scene was changed to mansions of the dead.

First all was dark, then blue sepulchral flame
Rose wavering all around, and gave to view
Dire objects of affright unmeet to name:
Anon a ghastly form came wading through
The dusky flames; whose bleeding mangled frame
Soon as, with wild affright, King KENNETH knew,
With screams he fled from the detested sight,
And frantic sought to shun his enemy by flight.

The monarch now, who spent the autumn day
Driving the mountain deer, himself was driven;
Till he had reached the self-same copsewood gray
Where the view-shout so merrily was given:
Nor breathing time was granted him to pray!
Lochlee danced wildly to the blast of Heaven,
And KENNETH from a beetling crag was dash'd,
And wildly o'er his corse the blue refulgence flash'd.

FRAGMENT.
O Melancholy!  softly-soothing maid!
Much do I owe to shine enchanting sway;
For thou hast led me through this leaf-strown glade
Duly at early morn and evening gray;
Then, at thy call, unwonted charms pervade:
The simplest scene amid the forest gay.
O nought exalts the soul to mood so high
As thy celestial pure society!

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

"Mind for itself creates society;"&mdash;
So said the Roman hero famed of old:
Man never is alone!  The woods supply
Health to the body; to the mind unfold
Best fellowship, conceptions wild and high;
While of in crowded scenes wan spectres hold
Dominion o'er the soul, and quench the flame
That fills with heavenly bliss the poet's frame.

If e'er this withered heart hath known the glow
Of inspiration high, it is when sleep
Hath soothed to rest each corporal source of woe,
And morning smiles upon the mountain steep,
And forth into the forest-walks I go,
O'er which the health-inspiring breezes sweep,
And only with the SHADOWY TRIBES OF MIND
I pass my social day in raptures unconfined.

Yet not with heavenly trains and angels bright
Alone is past the day; for endless store
Of legends wild then HISTORY brings to light
That long have mouldered in oblivion hoar;
And with enchanting hues the scenes are dight,
That more them pristine splendour can restore,
As when the rising morn with purple ray
Illumes the mouldering tower and desolate abbaye.

FRAGMENT.
And all around interminable heath
Filled the wide scene; on which the morning ray
Faintly diffused a watery gleam; no breath
Of ruder wind disturbed the vapours gray,
That rolled their mighty banners still as death
Then forth into the woods he bent his way
The MELANCHOLY KNIGHT! &mdash; sweet odours rose,
And half had lulled his anguish to repose.

But pain, alas!  awakening in his frame,
Shot his keen darts ; for slow consuming cares
Of warlike knight had left him but the name,
And whitened with untimely frost his hairs,&mdash;
Then to the lonely wilderness he came
To breathe the freshness of autumnal airs,
In solitude remote, where not a voice
In accents rude might dare arraign his humble choice.

But ever and anon, though Pain awoke,
Would some sweet odour float upon the gale,
And the dread spells of wasting anguish broke,&mdash;
It seemed as if some undiscovered vale,
Obscured perchance by high o'erarching rock
That hope-reviving odour did exhale
From unseen wildwood flourishing in pride,
Casting its balmy fragrance far and wide.

Or rather did it seem, that in the air
Angelic forms descending from on high,
Did on their wings unearthly odours bear;&mdash;
So deemed the Knight with rising ecstacy,
For now magnificent beyond compare
Were the wild features of the scenery,
As morn's advancing glories 'gan unfold
The Autumn's yellow fields and woods of glittering gold.

But slowly on his watchful sight arose
The varied beauties of the sylvan reign.
First the sweet fragrance lulled him to repose,
He felt no more the fiery throbs of pain,
Then a faint lambent flame within him glows,
A gleam of youthful joy revived again&mdash;
Hope shed upon the grass a roseate light,
And dim illusions floated o'er his sight.

Then Memory woke, and slowly on his ear
Fell the sweet notes of music loved of yore;
That mighty Bards first woke in accents clear,
And o'er all nations endless echoes bore,&mdash;
Immortal strains 'twas ecstacy to hear
Of power long lost enchantment to restore:
Aye, Memory woke those lofty strains, and threw
O'er all the rural scenes divine enchantment new.

FRAGMENT.
O Heaven!  what lovely tints around me play!
The sweet enchantments of Autumnal morn!
What nameless bliss assumes unwonted sway!
What soothing dreams are on my fancy borne!
Enchantress HOPE, awake! &mdash; with heavenly ray
Again illume my pilgrimage forlorn!
Memory, awake!  thy choicest stores unfold,
And renovate the joys that charmed my path of old.

Again the glories of the noonday light
Are spread abroad, and all the scenes are gay,
And Fancy revels in creations bright
As through the shady woodland walks I stray,
The while the distant landscape charms my sight
With richest hues that autumn can display&mdash;
There purple hills and fields of floating gold
Are to my watchful sight alternately unrolled.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

The influences of that autumnal morn
Woke every finer sense, and heavenly rays
Were shed upon the wilderness forlorn,
And wild Imagination's kindling blaze
Did all the woods with matchless light adorn,
And without effort flowed the impassioned lays&mdash;
Are ecstacies like these deceitful?  No!&mdash;
These are the purest, best, e'er given to man below.

When the same nerves and frame that but at morn
Were bathed in Rapture's most delicious trance,
The screws reversed, are agonized and torn;
And Intellect, whose animating glance
Did all the scenes with matchless tints adorn,
Is quenched and cold and dark; what hope or chance
Remains to quell the demons dire that wait,
Grinding their fangs, the Ministers of Fate?

'Tis but a passing cloud &mdash; a little while,
And the bright sun will beam abroad again,
And the fair prospects in their glory smile,
And Fancy, with reanimating reign,
With new delights my lonely path beguile,
And burst the bonds that now my soul enchain;
O then what rapture in my heart will rise,
Even at the simplest sight that greets my watchful eyes!

So whispers HOPE, &mdash; but, oh!  the mournful void,
The direful sway of anguish and despair;
Remorse for hours unworthily employed
(Reckless of Nature's lovely scenery fair,
Prime treasury of pleasures unalloyed,)
And thousand nameless fiends my vitals tear.&mdash;
Oh!  when shall Morning on my path diffuse
Again her lovely light, and soul-enchanting hues?

The sweet creations of poetic hours,&mdash;
Where are they now?  Remembrance only throws
A semblance faint, as in November's bowers,
When the south-wind with balmy influence blows,
Or when the winds are hushed, and deeply lowers
The heavy sky, the fading leaves disclose
A faint perfume to him who strays alone
Through the wild forest walks with matted leaves bestrown.

INDEPENDENCE.
And through the live-long night I heard the rain,
And driving night-winds through the forest blow,
And o'er my soul a melancholy train
Of visionary fears their clouds did throw:
But when fair morning cheered the scenes again,
O then fast fled the sable trains of woe!
I marked a rosy light around me shine
And knew the presence of a guest divine.

Dark, dark and lowering were the clouds, but still
A radiance emanated from the sky,
That gave a magic hue to dale and hill,
With Autumn's yellow leaves in harmony.
A holy calm my watchful mind did fill&mdash;
Anon my heart was roused to ecstacy,
For HOPE'S enchanting form before me stood,
And pointed to the path that wound amid the wood.

The cool fresh odours of the copsewood gay
Did all around a healing balm diffuse,
And cheerful I pursued the winding way,
Deep hung with silvery robe of chilling dews,&mdash;
Till on my view Helvellyn's forehead gray
Arose adorned by morn's advancing hues,
And 'mid the wilderness a temple shone,
Whose wonders till that hour were all to me unknown.

Here INDEPENDENCE reigned; &mdash; her palace high
Stood on a rock sublime; and all around
Were magic scenes of wild variety.
And when the arduous pathway I had wound,
And the proud portals did asunder fly,
Oh!  then the fulness of enjoyment crowned
My ravished sense; for many a happy sight
Was to the view displayed amid that region bright.

Here one immortal Poet musing strayed;
His mind was his own kingdom; nor the pride
Nor pomp of courts could lure him from the shade,
Wherein his mighty soul soared far and wide
To scenes remote in fairy tints arrayed,
And every sight and sound did him provide
Sweet solace, when the wind blew high or low,
Or poured October's rain, or fell December's snow.

Oft times he stood, and listened to the gale,
That through the hollow caverns moaning past;
And looked upon the fading foliage pale,
That the night-winds had on his pathway cast;
And when the tempest raved along the vale,
He loved to hear the roarings of the blast,
That more enchanting music could supply,
Than all the powers of artful minstrelsy.

Reckless alike was he of blame or praise;
That could not elevate; nor this depress;
For his own pastime he attuned his lays,
Ne cared for their failure or success.
All doubts and fears were lost amid the blaze
Of light that did each meaner thought repress,&mdash;
That inward light, that bears aloft the soul
To realms where other worlds in boundless ocean roll.

FRAGMENT.
Amid the mists of a November morn,
Methought I marked a castle proud arise,
Whose mouldering ivied walls with age were worn:&mdash;
My heart was roused to kindling ecstacies;
For ne'er till then did scene so wild, forlorn,
Such grandeur in decay delight mine eyes&mdash;
Each battlement I marked, and nodding tower,
And window erst so gay in Beauty's radiant bower.

Then did I mark beneath a portal grey
The castle's woful owner pensive stand;
It seemed to meet the Morn's first rising ray,
And breathe her first reviving influence bland.
Thither deep musing he had bent his way;
But wizard Indolence, with magic wand,
Had lulled to rest each nerve; and waking sleep
Did in perpetual dreams his drowsy senses steep.

But, oh, his visage!!  not a trace was there
Of aught that should to living man pertain;
An early victim he of ceaseless care,
That preyed upon his cheek and parched his brain;
And, Fortitude, alas!  to dire despair,
Though lingering long, resigned her heavenly reign.
Yet in his eye a lambent light arose,
As radiant Morn advanced her glories to disclose.

Then, as in splendour onwards moved the day,
Wild mountains shewed their rugged cliffs o'ergrown
With wildwood, where, yet lovely in decay,
In dewy light the yellow foliage shone;
Then, as the silvery mist-wreaths rolled away,
A sunbeam on the glassy lake was thrown,
And at the sight the redbreast woke his lay,
And forth advanced the wanderer on his way.

Then changed the scene into a garden fair&mdash;
Fair, though beneath November's mournful sway:
For oaks and hardier orchard trees were there,
Whose varied hues long lingered on the spray;
And proudly too the pine-tree, never bare,
And yew fantastic, rose in trim array;
Then marked I where the Melancholy Knight
Slow stalking did admire that region of delight.

And as along the velvet walks he strayed,
With leaves bestrown, deep drenched in balmy dews,
Faultering in melancholy tones he said,
"How glorious are the fading forest's hues!
How exquisite the odours of the shade,
That o'er my languid frame their balm diffuse.
O man unwise, those heavenly charms to slight,
In crowded scenes to grasp at base impure delight!

"Aye, heavenly are the charms that round me reign&mdash;
It is not from the scene that fills mine eyes
Alone, nor from the sylvan songster's strain,
That gleams of hope and confidence arise;
A mightier power this wondrous earth sustains;
A secret balm, descending from the skies,
Robes the wild groves, and wakes the songster's voice,
And bids the wise and good, and pure in heart, rejoice."

FRAGMENT.
Bright beams the sun; the western breezes blow;
The scenes are mellowed by transparent haze;
And Nature reassumes the temperate glow,
That Autumn in her last, last smile displays&mdash;
Ere Winter's blasts awake, and driving snow,
And not a leaf the dark oak tree arrays.
Oh scenes of inexhaustible delight, Guiltless!&mdash;
Oh might I prize your magic charms aright!

But Indolence has dulled each nerve, and weighs
On every sense; and, wrapt in waking sleep
And ceaseless reverie, I waste my days,
And of the swift-winged hours no reckoning keep;
And but in thought I roam the woodland maze,
And night and day I hear the breezes sweep
Round my lone chamber, save when trance profound,
And slumber's heavy spells, my senses all have bound.

A charm there is in Winter's awful reign
Best known to bosoms not untouched by woe;
A charm that more inspires the poet's strain,
Than all the joys that summer can bestow;
Dear are the driving winds and chilling rain,
And dear the withered heaps that rest below
The parent boughs, on which erewhile so gay
They shone beneath the Autumn's magic ray.

PRINCE IPOMMYDON.
No joy had he in aught that passed around,
Nor song nor dance his languid soul could sway;
Lonely he sought the forest's utmost bound;
Lonely he spent the night, lonely the day:
But, when the twilight ray with purple crowned
The mountain's steep, he watched the slow decay;
It seemed as if he drank the lovely light,
That filled his fancy with creations bright.

Whence is it that he shuns the festive bower,
Where melting dames are met in bright array
To charm with converse sweet the fleeting hour?&mdash;
Whence is it that he loves alone to stray
When the wild light of Even's uncertain shower
Slowly declines upon the mountain gray
Oh, listen, lordings, to my feeble strain,
Whilst I the sources of his woes explain!

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

'Twas a sweet sylvan scene, where never voice
Of Bacchanalian rout, or step profane,
Nor soul untouched by pure poetic joys,
Had marred of lonely bliss the tranquil reign&mdash;
For Nature here did in herself rejoice,
And, fearless, woke the thrush his earliest strain,
And many a tree, in amorous junction twined,
Sheltered that faery glade from every ruder wind.

It chanced amid that lonely scene THE CHILDE
His way had bent the tangled woods among,
What time the sun his dying radiance wild
Diffused the peaceful plains and glades along;
His soul was wrapt in meditations mild,
What-while he listened to the cheering song
That early thrush and woodlark poured amain,
To hail the tranquil charms of Evening's lovely reign.

As on amid the tangled wood he strayed,
A radiance rising in the western sky
Had all the groves in purple tints arrayed&mdash;
But, oh!  for some seraphic minstrelsy
To paint the form that, floating through the shade,
Rose like a sunbeam to his watchful eye!
In vain are all the powers of earthly lay,
That form of melting grace and beauty to display.

If thou hast ever loved in solitude
To thread the mazes of the woodland wild,
If thou hast loved along the rocky wood,
To watch the dying tints of radiance mild,
If thou with genuine fervour hast pursued
These joys from city tumults far exiled,
Then thou may'st picture to thyself a sight,
What I may not pourtray, in breathing colours bright.

That angel form that rose so suddenly
Faded as fast; she came and she is gone,
Like the wild splendour of the morning sky,
On some fantastic cliff of vapour thrown!
And, wrapt in trance of breathless ecstacy,
The Youth is left amid the woods alone.
But never from that hour could earthly dame,
Or knightly sport, for him the wonted solace frame.

His days were spent ill meditations deep
On her whom he, alas!  might meet no more;
And Hope would with wild visions haunt his sleep,
(His waking sleep) and all his bliss restore,
And when the morn with purple crowned the steep,
Her rosy wings his wayward fancy bore
To heights to all unknown; and all around
Half deemed that madness dire his senses did confound.

In sooth it might of him be rightly said,
He did not live, but dreamed his time away,
The demon of perpetual thought had made
The hapless Youth her unresisting prey;
And, or in bower, or in the greenwood shade,
Alike was his companion night and day,
Till his sunk hollow eyes, abstracted air,
Did all the woes of hopeless love declare.

Vain was the song, the dance; alone he seemed
Even in the midst of multitudes; &mdash; in vain
Did ladies cast their smiles, that all had deemed
Celestial, who were numbered in their train;
In vain enlivening tapers brightly gleamed,
And minstrels raised on high the Jocund strain:
In waking sleep he moved; all outward things
Were profitless and void, &mdash; fantastic shadowings.

One only maiden bright there was who knew
His soul to charm; a slow and plaintive strain
From voice and harp with trembling touch she drew,&mdash;
And yet, alas!  her knowledge was in vain,
For when the strain was done, away he flew!&mdash;
The song, but not the songstress, could obtain
His cold regard; and, still, the forest through
His lonely way he bent, his visions to renew.

How sweet the obscurities of early morn,
While yet, in sleep, all nature seems to lie,
Save, from amid the misty copsewood borne,
Rise wandering witch-notes of wild minstrelsy
'Twas that sweet early hour &mdash; the white hawthorn
Gave odours sweet as gales of Araby;
For May's luxuriant reign in hill and dale
Loaded with sweets ambrosial every gale.

A vision rose; and thus the Youth addrest:
"In dreams no longer wear thy life away;
The peerless maid whose image fires thy breast,
The sceptre of a distant land doth sway:&mdash;
Befits it then in dull inglorious rest
And empty visions thus, from day to day,
Thy time to waste, nor strive in Glory's plain
One honourable wreath of laurel to obtain?

"Lo!  now the radiance of the morning sky
Illumes with rosy light the dewy plain;
And, hark!  the thrush awakes his melody,
Emprising thus his amorous suit to gain&mdash;
Listen!  Oh mark his thrilling minstrelsy&mdash;
How full, how sweet, how passionate the strain!
And is it meet for thee no lay to wake,
No service to endure for thy sweet Empress' sake?

"Shall not the breezy incense-breathing air
Thy soul awake, and bid thy frame expand
With resolutions proud to spurn despair,
And prove thy puissance at my command?
Lo!  I am with thee still; my guardian care
Shall guide thee in thy course from land to land
Sufferings thou may'st endure, and dangers dire,
But purer shall come forth from sorrow's searching fire."

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Realms of enchantment, where the Youth pursued
His venturous way, &mdash; whilom full well I knew
The loveliest scenery of your solitude,
And from your charms sweet inspiration drew;
And careless wove the flowers in sportive mood,
That round my path in gay luxuriance grew;
But, ah!  the days, so sweet, but give the sting
Of bitter contrast now, to hopeless sorrowing.
