The Sun has sunk beneath the trembling wave,
To gild another Heaven with orient light,
And nought is heard amid the stillness, save
The lonely whisper of the conscious night;
How sweet to rove when veil'd from human sight
By the dark curtain which enwraps the sky,
How sweet to drink from thought the pure delight
Which ever shuns the gay, and still must fly
The fickle Sons of wantonness and vanity.

Where are the hopes of Childhood, where of Youth,
The joyous vision which encharm'd the view?
Where are the friends whose constancy and truth
Would fresh for every scene our strength renew?
Our Fathers, where are they? &mdash; beneath the yew
The mouldering turf entombs their sacred earth
Their clay unconscious drinks the silent dew,
And left behind with aught that gave them birth,
Their weariness, and pain, their hopes and noisy mirth.

And haply soon, o'er my departed dust,
The lonely cypress will its branches wave,
And soon at most receive its fragile trust,
The narrow precinct of my humble grave.
O God!  and is there nought on earth can save,
Nought that can teach me to avert the blow?
And is it vain a longer stay to crave,
And wilt Thou surely lay thy creature low?
Beneath thy chastening rod, O let me humbly bow.
