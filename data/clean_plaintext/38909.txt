I stood upon a hill, and saw a town
Shrouded with smoke in the fair vale below,
Chequering the fields with spots of dusky brown,
Whilst here and there the busy furnace' glow
Sent sooty vaporous volumes up in middle air,
To tell that "hundred-handed" steam was working there.

And ever with the rush of fitful wind
Came the loud roll of wains; the din of men,
The tumult of the crowd of human kind,
Swelled in the gust; till silence fell again
When the wind's restless agency at length was still,
Or fainter breezes fail'd to reach my distant hill.

The scene was fair; the sunshine glittering bright
Had gilded all that city, and from tower,
House top, and steeple, many a glancing light
Shot gaily in the summer's mid-noon hour&mdash;
When, sauntering listlessly, I left my resting place
To seek awhile that crowded borough's ample space.

And then the illusion vanished as a dream!
No sounds of honest industry were there,
But oath and ribaldry, and curse and scream,
And sordid insolence with ruffian stare,
With all the evil passions which keep state
And flourish most where men most congregate.

And slaves were many, though the land was free,
Slaves, &mdash; where the whirling engines' giddy roar
Proclaims where art and ceaseless industry
Add ever to the wealthy merchant's store;
But where a wretched race, in infancy, begin
A foul apprenticeship to malady and sin.

I turned away; I could not bear to see
Society and commerce, wealth and power,
Each add a sting to human misery;
Each dull the sunshine of "man's little hour."
Alas!  how well they point the moral of that theme
Which calls the life of man a short and painful dream!
