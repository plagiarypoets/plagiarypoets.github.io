Sir, I applaud your enterprise, and say
Y'our undertaking was a bold assay:
But you have nobly don't, and we may read
A work that all old Poems doth exceed.
Avant you Grecian Mungrils, with your Scraps
Fal'n from blinde Homers, or did Hesiods chaps:
Musaeus too (for all Scaligers cracking).
With Hero and Leander may be packing.
Virgil be gon!  we hate thy slandrous tongue,
For doing the chast Queen of Carthage wrong.
Venusian Horace too hereafter may
Put up his pipes, and hearken to thy Lay.
Ovid, thy several witty Poems, all
From hence to Pontus into exile call.
Valerius Flaccus, hang thy Golden Fleece
Before some honest Tavern door in Greece.
Silius Italicus hence get thee far
With all the tumults of thy Punick war:
And Spanish Lucan quickly call away
Caesar and Pompey to Pharsalia.
Statius thy Theban story leave to brag:
And listen all unto Loves-Hawking Bag.
Chaucer, we now commit thee to repose,
And care not for thy Romance of the Rose.
In thy grave at Saint Edmonds Bury, thy
Hector henceforth (Lydgate) may with thee ly;
Old Gower (in like manner) we despise,
Condemning him to silence for his Cryes.
And Spencer, all thy Knights may (from this time)
Go seek Adventures in another Clime.
These Poets were but Footposts that did come
Halting unto's, whom thou hast all outrun:
For Sol hath lent thee Pegasus the Nag,
To gallop to us with Loves-Hawking Bag;
And welcome (mighty Poet) that alone
Art fit to sit with Phoebus in his throne.
