L'ALLEGRO.
Love shall not disturb our rest,
Social joys of life are best!
We're for frolic, sport, and play,
Come, and laugh your hours away!

IL PENSOROSO.
Let us trace the lonely vale,
Hear the love-lorn nightingale:
Love invite to secret glades,
Purling streams, and moonlight shades.

L'ALLEGRO.
We enjoy our crouded plains,
Cheerful nymphs, and careless swains,
Join with us the busy throng,
We're for merry dance and song!

IL PENSOROSO.
Love's fond passion sooths the mind,
We're to tender love inclin'd:
Sweets its languours, calm its joys,
Friend to peace, and foe to noise.

CHORUS.
When pleasure's inviting, obey the glad call,
Let all have delight, for there's joy for us all:
Here's mirth for the jovial, who never repine,
For Love here's the myrtle, for Wit, the rich vine!
