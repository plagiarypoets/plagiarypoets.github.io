TO MELANCHOLY.
Wan Melancholy!  rueful and forlorn!
Why thus intrud'st thou on my solitude?
Ah!  say, with thee for ever must I mourn,
And by thy pow'r malignant be subdued?
Ah!  rather fly, and seek some desert rude,
That I no more may catch thy glance malign;
When Joy, like some divine beatitude,
Upon me may beneficently shine.
But if to haunt me, Melancholy's thine,
Then come divested of thy threatening frown,
That I, with pleasure bending o'er thy shrine,
At last with pensive tenderness may crown
My spirit, weary of life's bustling throng,
That sighs alike for leisure and for song.

TO WOMAN.
Soft let the numbers, as sweet music, blow,
Be present all the Loves and Graces here;
I sing the soother of corroding woe,
Whose heav'nly smile can brighten ev'ry tear,
Enchanting woman!  rougher man's compeer!
His guardian angel in this world of care,
To soothe him with her sympathy sincere,
And smile upon him with her looks so fair,
That breathe of Love, and might control Despair!
Queen of the winning grace, the melting eye,
The witching feature, and the nameless air!
When for thy peerless charms I cease to sigh,
May I no more then breathe the tuneful lay,
But sink me down and sigh my soul away.
