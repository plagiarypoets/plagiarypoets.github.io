When from the outward Sences is convai'd,
All their relations in the common Sence,
And so to Fantasie (as erst was said)
And then to Reason, or Intelligence,
From whence (being sent to Judgments conference,)
It lastly comes to Contemplations sight,
Which is the view of Truthes true consequence;
For Reas'n and Judgment finds out what is right,
Which Contemplation views with rare delight.
