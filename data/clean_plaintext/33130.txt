M  Maie not an olive branch of Peace, Truith, Love,
a  att heavnlie zeales flame, tyne more lampes with yee?
r  rouze up thy fethers O meeke Turtle-Dove!
i  invert eake the seaes rage!  so heere shall see
a,  armes yeild to Love, Truith, Justice, foes agree.
A  Above all Virtewes, Love is soveraigne,
n  nor was theare ever Faith without trewe Love,
g  gives fier to concord, peace, truith, justice traine;
l  Love conquers Hate, as heere twoe Ladies prove:
i  in whose perspective mirrour cleere is seene
ae:  Englandes lacke, supplied in yee Faerie Queene,
C  Com then!  that Temperances sober feast
M.  maie all invite, from brawles, to tranquil rest!
