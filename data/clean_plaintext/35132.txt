I know thee, Sorrow, with thy downcast eye
And hair dishevel'd:  o'er thy furrow'd mien
No transient beam of Joy is ever seen,
As sad thou rov'st, when evening veils the sky,
To seek thy haunts.  The roseate hours are gone,
When fairy Hope thro' many a blooming vale
With gladsome steps once cheerly led thee on,
'Midst musick's powers, wak'd by the whispering gale
But ah, how fickle Fortune chang'd the scene!
Just suffer'd life's bright views to meet thine eye,
To plunge thee deeper into misery,
With no bright ray of Hope to intervene;
And left thee of her ills the bitter share,
To mourn upon the brink of dark Despair.
