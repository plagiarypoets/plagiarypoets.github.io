Ionia &mdash; sad Ionia! &mdash; is this wreck
All that remains to tell thy splendid tale?
Was it for this thy myriads toil'd to deck
Nature with Art, until the priest grew pale
In his own fane &mdash; and deem'd the incensed gale
Waved the rich tresses of his Phidian god?
Are glories born like thine, but to exhale,
As dews forgotten from the mountain sod?&mdash;
Yes &mdash; fallen Ionia! &mdash; as thy temples nod,
Earthquaked by Time &mdash; while, at night's pensive noon,
The jackal howls through theatres untrod,
Mute as the soft light of their Asian moon;&mdash;
So fade the fair, the proud, the famed, the strong&mdash;
All save eternal truth and sacred song!
