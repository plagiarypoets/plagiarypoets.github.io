Does not the Muse, that o'er thy cradle smiled,
And sooth'd thee on the banks of fair Champlain;
Does she not warble still those wood-notes wild,
That taught thee first to love the woodland reign?
If so, Oh Rosa!  touch thy lyre again;
Or wake thy lute to forest melody;
Oh!  breathe some soft, some sweet, enchanting strain,
Such as the linnet chaunts upon the lea,
Or such as sounds at eve, along the western sea.

So may the echoes of the woodland wake,
And rouse the wood-nymphs and Naiad throng;
Who sporting near the willow border'd lake,
Repeat with airy tongues the sylvan song.&mdash;
Meanwhile the muses, (as they dance along,)
Pluck the wild flowers, from the hedge rows green,
And seated deep the hidden glens among,
Weave a gay garland, on their groves unseen,
To place upon the brow of their poetic Queen.
