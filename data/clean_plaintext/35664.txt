Child of the light, fair Morning Hour,
That smilest o'er yon purple Hill,
I come to woo thy cheering power
Beside yon murmuring rill.
Nor I alone &mdash; a thousand songsters rise,
To meet thy dawning, and thy sweets to share,
While every flow'r, that scents the honied air,
Thy milder influence feels, and shews the brightest dies.

And let me hear some village swain
Whistle in rustic glee along;
Or share some true love's gentle pain,
Breath'd from the milk-maid's song.
Wild are those notes, but sweeter far to me,
Than the soft airs, borne from Italian groves,
To which the wanton muse, and naked loves,
Strike the wild warbling lyre, and dance in gamesome glee.

And rosy Health, for whom so long
Mid sleepless nights I sigh'd in vain,
Shall throw her airy vestment on,
And meet me on the plain:
Gay laughing nymph, that loves a morning sky,
That loves to trip across the spangled dews,
And with her finger, dipp'd in brightest hues,
My faint cheek shall she tinge, and cheer my languid eye.

Then will I hail the Morning Hour,
And singing bless the new-born day;
Or wand'ring in Amanda's bower,
Rifle the sweets of May;
And to my song Amanda shall attend,
And take the posie from the sylvan muse,
For sure the virtuous Fair will not refuse,
The Muse's modest gift, her tribute to a friend.
