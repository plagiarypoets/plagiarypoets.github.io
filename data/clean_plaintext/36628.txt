When last we parted, Lady, 'twas in tears;
Thy cheek was dimmed with sorrow's trickling dew,
And from my heart the grief of many years,
Hoarded 'till nigh forgotten, burst anew,
Sad offerings to love and memory true.
Shall ever memory faint, or love be cold?
Ah, no!  that cheek may lose its breathing hue,
And those dear eyes their living beams withhold,
But love shall still endure, with faith unknown, untold.

Accept the tribute that to thee I bring,
(It is the first, and it will be the last,)
The leisure fruit of fancy's wandering:
But fancy rules no more &mdash; her sway is past,
And into other paths my course is cast:
Me now no more shall fiction's dreams beguile;
Their hues like fading rainbows vanish fast;&mdash;
My feet shall tread in ways of drearier toil,
And fiction hide her wreath, and poesy her smile.

Yet, if to me a loftier lyre were given,
And round my harp were twined a brighter wreath,&mdash;
If I could snatch immortal verse from heaven,
And pour its melody to souls beneath,&mdash;
It may be that I would not cease to breathe
Thy name in accents love should make divine,
And round thy beauteous brows a band enwreath,
A garland bright, whose flower should brightly shine,
More lovely, and more bright, when sunned by smiles of thine.

My Lady Love!  am I not far from thee?&mdash;
Far, far away &mdash; but soon again we meet;
Ye moments swift, oh, yet more swiftly flee,
Ye slower hours, away on winged feet;
Waft me, oh, waft me upon pinions fleet,
Give me again my vows of love to tell,
Steal fond approval from her blushes sweet,
Adore her flowing cheek and bosom's swell,
And win the silent thoughts, that in that bosom dwell.
