And yet I cannot reprehend the flight,
Or blame th' attempt presuming so to sore;
The mounting venter for a high delight,
Did make the honour of the fall the more.
For who gets wealth that puts not from the shore?
Danger hath honor, great designes their fame,
Glorie doth follow, courage goes before.
And though th' event oft answers not the same,
Suffice that high attempts have never shame.
The meane observer (whom base safetie keeps)
Lives without honour, dies without a name,
And in eternall darknes ever sleeps.
and therefore DELIA, tis to me no blot,
To have attempted, though attained thee not.
