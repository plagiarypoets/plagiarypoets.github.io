Adieu!  thou lovely one!  whose steadfast tongue
Hath long denied me, and doth still deny;
Far from my country's bosom ever flung,
Yet still for thee in solitude to sigh,
And bless, till death, thy lonely memory,
I go; &mdash; remembered but by faithful few;
Yet when afar my requiem hymn is sung
O'er my low grave, wilt thou with mournful yew,
My empty cenotaph in swelling anguish strew?&mdash;

Wilt thou deny to former times a tear,
And learn, unmoved, that I am deadly cold,
When strangers tell thee of my sable bier,
And say they heard my solemn death-bell knolled,
And saw me shrouded in my last pale fold;&mdash;
Or haply say, uncertain, "there was one
Of silent, pensive, melancholy, there,
Of whom we know but by his nameless stone,
He lived in desolation, and is dead and gone"?
