May I (far from desire of being Great)
Enjoy a little Quiet Seat,
That overlooks a Chrystal Stream:
With Mind as Calm, as is her Brow,
Pure as the Fountain, whence her Waters flow;
Those Pleasures tast a Cynick could not blame.
And may (Ye watry Sisters all,
With Fruitfulness and Plenty crown'd)
May all your Dewy Blessings on Me fall!
Ye, that from craggy Rocks do take Your Source,
Or from the Flowry Hills do grow:
All, that in hollow Vaults resound,
Or do from Fruitfull Valleys flow:
All, that through Rocks Your way do force,
And foaming Waves in pieces dash;
All, that in Flowry Meadows stray,
And with Your Amorous Banks do play;
All, whose proud Waves the Walls of Citties wash;
All, that thro Deserts take Your Course.
All, whose wide Bosoms Ships do plow,
Which Vice and Riches bring:
All, that to humble Cotes do bow,
And hear the Jolly Shepherds, when they sing:
The Haughty, Rapid, and Imperious Dames;
The Still, the Quiet, and Soft-gliding Streams:
May all assist the Angler's harmless Sport,
And with Full Hands unto Our Line Resort;
All, that with Silver Feet
In Melting Numbers and Harmonious Strains,
Immortal Spencer once did cause to meet
On th' Marriage-Day of Medway and of Thames!
