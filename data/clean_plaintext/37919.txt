SHAKESPEARE and MILTON, sweetest bird, agree,
That thy night-warblings breathe a mournful strain,
Of adverse fortune seeming to complain;
CHAUCER and SPENSER hail thy vernal glee;
Can such enlighten'd minds at variance be!
Why should thy dulcet tones arise from pain?
Or what of mirth from darkness can'st thou gain?
No &mdash; all below own Nature's wise decree&mdash;
She bids each vital being seek a mate;
Hence to her impulse must thy breast incline,
A partner calling to thy shady state,
Joyful to meet thee at the wonted sign.
Oh!  may it be, sweet bird, thy happy fate,
To gain a mate whose love will equal thine.
