Small his reward for long and weary pain,
Save what himself can on himself bestow,
And little guerdon is the Poet's gain:
Few are the kindred breasts which seem to know
The holy raptures of the soul's full glow.
The freezing breath of cold and languid praise
Nips in their birth the fairest flowers that blow:
Vain task those plants to rear in wintry days,
Which scarce their buds unfold beneath Spring's warmest rays.

For gentle and retiring is the Muse,
Unfit the thorny path of life to tread;
Nurs'd in the wanton sun and heav'ns own dews,
How shall she lift her sad and drooping head
Where the dim fogs of earth's chill desart spread?
The silent plaudit of one willing smile,
Which from affection's anxious lip is shed,
The eye which chastens, yet approves the while,&mdash;
These seeks the timid Muse, and these her course beguile.

Such, dear inspirer of my early rhyme,
Such was the kindling praise I drew from thee:
Oft pass'd th' uncounted day in mingled chime
Of flowing undivided colloquy,
On all the lore of either poesy;
While thou wouldst bid the Muse, who idly stray'd,
And pour'd her matin warblings listlessly,
Her scatter'd blossoms in one chaplet braid,
And draw the violet forth from the dark poppy shade.

Then what sweet hope would rush upon my sight!
What joyous visions my rapt sense illume!
Of everlasting fame, and promise bright
Of those immortal flow'rs which love to bloom,
Breathing rich odour round the Poet's tomb!
Oh!  may I from death's still and shadowy wing
Snatch half my being, and avoid the gloom
Which o'er forgotten names time hastes to fling!
Those not ignobly die, who not ignobly sing!
