Hail Pity!  gentlest child of heaven,
Whose soothing charms beguile the smart,
Of the sad breast by sorrows riven,
And calm the anguish of the woe-wrung heart.
Thy bosom bare, oft heav'd by many a sigh,
The tear still glist'ning in thy azure eye;
With clasping hands uprais'd, I see thee weep
Upon the rude and rocky steep:
Imploring heav'nly aid to save,
(While sounding tempests have the deep,)
The mariner, whose wearied arm
No longer braves the howling storm,
And shrieking sinks beneath the o'erwhelming wave.

With milder look and pensive mien,
Sad bending o'er the closing grave,
Thy angel form is often seen:
Or seeking brooding sorrow's darken'd cave.
Still cautious treading lest thy foot should spoil
Some hapless little insect's hard-spent toil;
Or crush with agony the writhing worm.
And as thou journiest slow along,
Stop'st to hear the maniac's song,
And breath'st a long-drawn heart-felt sigh,
And drop'st the pearly tear that dimm'd thy swimming eye.

Thou lov'st to find the wretch's haunt,
Enter'st free his lowly shed,
Th' abode of dire disease and want,
And scatter'st roses o'er his thorny bed.
Oft in the loathsome dungeon art thou found,
Where horror spreads her blackest shades around,
And stop'st the mournful tale to hear,
Of sorrowing vice, rehears'd with many a tear.
Mildly thou bid'st the mourner cease,
And woo'st his troubled soul to peace.

Thou fann'st of hope the languid fires,
The drop distemper'd, from his brow dost wipe,
While pang-fed mis'ry quits her iron gripe,
And with her haggard train she half retires.
The prison'd wretch thus robb'd of pain,
Awhile forgets his galling chain.
Pale sickness feels the placid charm;
Once more uplifts his wasted form;
Thy hand his throbbing temples holds the while.
Thy voice, dejected sorrow hears,
And dries awhile the starting tears,
And learns to raise her downcast eyes and smile.
