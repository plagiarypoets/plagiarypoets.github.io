There is a gleam that yet with sunny ray
Doth gild my lonely path, and many a flower
Doth blossom there that never shall decay,
Nor stoop nor tremble to the boisterous shower,
Nor wint'ry storm; but still in darkest hour
Shall fairer bloom the while: &mdash; my loftiest aim
Was humble, and to grandeur, wealth, and power,
I look'd not; but for all my little fame,
If such indeed might glimmer on my name,
I did but seek that 'mid the scatter'd few,
The slighted of the world, and slighting too,
Some gentle spirit haply would not blame
My simple lyre, but love perchance to hear
Its unambitious notes, nor blush to own them dear.

Then I am blest beyond my ev'ry thought,
For virtue's self hath smil'd upon my lays;
And more than all my proudest hopes had sought,
Hath deck'd my brow with undeserved bays;
And on my raptur'd soul the voice of praise
Hath made sweet mule, sweeter still to me
Thus warbling unpresum'd; &mdash; Oh!  well repays,
Too well indeed, my humble minstrelsy
Such recompence as this; &mdash; nor can it be
That tongue like mine my feelings can impart;
Save that, whate'er my future destiny,
I yet have that which breathing in my heart
Shall give to ev'ry joy a brighter charm,
To ev'ry struggling pang a solace and a calm.
