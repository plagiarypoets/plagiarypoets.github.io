While blest with the smiles of my fair,
What transports I felt at my heart!
With mine what delights could compare,
'Till forc'd from my Phillis to part:
Tho' far from the charmer remov'd,
Her image still dwells on my mind;
With sighs I reflect how we lov'd,
How beauteous she was and how kind:

Each day I revisit the glade,
Or seek the retreats of the grove;
Where oft with my Phillis I stray'd,
And told the soft tale of my love:
Each tender endearment I try'd,
With fondness she strove to outdo;
And still in soft contest we vy'd
Whose flame was most lasting and true.

How frequent I rose with the morn,
And e'er to my charmer I hy'd,
For flow'rets, her breast to adorn,
I robb'd the gay mead of its pride;
How sweet the reward of my toil,
When the nymph I so tenderly lov'd;
The present receiv'd with a smile,
And all my fond labours approv'd.

No blossom, 'tis true might compare
With the roses display'd on her cheek;
Nor lily, or snowdrop so fair
To equal the hue of her neck:
Yet one half in her bosom she plac'd,
And forming a wreath with the rest;
The head of her shepherd she grac'd;
Was ever fond shepherd so blest!

But now my dear Phillis is gone,
These transports no more I enjoy;
With her all my comforts are flown,
My passion no time can destroy:
Kind fortune, thy aid I implore
These moments of bliss to regain,
Oh!  send back the nymph I adore,
Or to her conduct her fond swain.
