Come Sorrow's soother!  come, oh balmy Sleep!
In gentle slumbers lull my woes to rest!
Oh!  let thine opiate o'er mine eye-lids creep,
And hush awhile the heavings of my breast!
For long &mdash; too long, alas!  with grief opprest,
The pang I've know of hopeless love severe.
Oft has the falt'ring sigh escap'd my breast,
And oft has anguish dropt the tricking tear!
But ah!  one solace I may yet find here,
Whose pow'r awhile may still this bosom's woes:
Come, then, oh Morpheus!  chace the starting tear,
And in soft sleep these humid eye-lids close!
And thou, oh Fancy!  shed thy darling gleams;
With Mary's presence charm my raptur'd dreams!
