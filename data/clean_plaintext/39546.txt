Mysterious source and seat of sense,
Whence all our whimsies spring,
May I presume, without offence,
Thy energies to sing.

The Poet's celebrated fount,
(Whate'er its title be,)
That sprung from old Parnassus' mount,
Was but a type of thee.

Thou art the true Pierian well,
Of which great Homer drank,
And all those bards that since excel
Throughout the classic rank.

Thy inspiration Maro crown'd
With never-dying fame;
Hence classic Horace lives renown'd;
Hence Milton's mighty name.

Our Shakspeare still supremely shines
In the dramatic sphere;
Hence flowed the seet descriptive lines,
That sung the circling year.

Hence Pope and Prior charm by turns;
Hence Goldsmith's polish'd lays;
And hence, lamented, Scottish Burns!
Thy recent claim to praise.

To thee, too, sentimental source!
Each lofty Son of Prose,
His tale's effect &mdash; his moral's force&mdash;
His varied beauties owes.

Plutarch and Tacitus of yore
Thy visions did illume;
With many a fam'd Historian more,
Down to the days of Hume.

Nor less indebted to thy aid
Is Eloquence confess'd;
From thee she learns to rouse, persuade,
And rule the human breast.

Thou taught'st Demosthenes' tongue
To lead the Grecian throng;
From thee the pow'rful periods sprung,
That Cicero roll'd along.

When Eloquence pours forth the tide
Of argument so clear,
Thou art the intellectual guide
That governs its career.

Philosophy, led by thy light,
Her deep researches makes;
Astronomy her boldest flight
Beneath thy guidance takes.

Great Newton hence, on eagle wing,
Through boundless systems soar'd;
Hence learned Locke each hidden spring
And maze of mind explored.

When Painting leads Taste's raptur'd eye
Her mimic scenes among;
When Music wakes the symphony
Of soul-entrancing song.

Thy nervous influence alone
The zest, the pleasure gives;
And Painting's tint, and Music's tone,
From thee its charm receives.

But ah!  if Melancholy's clouds
Obscure the mental sun&mdash;
And round tthy seat distemper'd crowds
Of wild conceptions run;

Then, Genius, Judgment, Fancy sink
In the tremendous gloom,
And madness rends each social link,
Regardless of her doom!
