Surrey and Sidney, honor of our age
Were both of them of noble parentage
Yet not their honor makes them live so longe
As doth their poems and learn'd pleasinge songe
Before their time Sir Jeff'ry Chaucer he
The first life giver to our poesie
Phaer and Twyne, Harvy, Gaskoyne, Goldinge
Lydgate, Skelton, Grange, Googe and Fleminge
Warner and Watson, France, Churchyarde, Whetson,
Monday, Lilly, Britton, Danyell, Draiton
Chapman and Jonson, Withers auncient Tusser
With the divine soule-pleasinge Silvester
And Noble Spencer nowe of Fairest fame
Whose glorious workes imortalize his name.
