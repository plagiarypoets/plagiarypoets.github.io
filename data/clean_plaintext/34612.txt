Hail Euterpe, nymph divine,
Fairest of the tuneful nine;
At thy chearful altar, see,
Low I bow the willing knee,
As on this auspicious day
Forth I pour the votive lay,
When to crown a nation's prayers,
And relieve a monarch's cares,
On high deeds of goodness bent
Heaven a royal son has sent,
Glory's brightest days to prove
In a free-born people's love,
Blest, and blessing to bestow
Every joy that mortals know.

Ever sacred be the morn,
Princely babe, that saw thee born:
Kindest influence on that hour
Friendly stars conspired to pour:
Sought to bless the subject earth,
Sought to bless &mdash; and give Thee birth.

Heedless for herself awhile,
See the tender CHARLOTTE smile!
She amidst a mother's throes
Looks of love on thee bestows;
Sweetest prince, one smile employ
To compleat a parent's joy.
Lo!  around, the matron band,
Pleasing task!  attentive stand;
Duty, love, and joy combin'd,
Captive hold each anxious mind.
But not words, nor numbers faint
GEORGE'S heart-felt bliss can paint,
How his conscious looks exprest
Softest passions in his breast,
When, to his delighted ear
Proud the pleasing news to bear,
Fame enraptur'd did relate
Favour'd Albion's happy fate.

While from every hill around
Notes of public joy resound,
Rising from his wat'ry bed
Britain's Genius rears his head:
Proudly tow'ring to the skies
See his awful form arise,
Hear him pour this ardent prayer
O'er the much-lov'd monarch's heir;

"On him shed, indulgent heaven,
Choicest gifts to mortals given,
Every blessing may he share,
Every virtue be his care;
From example form'd to be
Noble, good, and wise as He,
Who, of every grace possest
That adorns a monarch's breast,
Strives, nor can he strive in vain,
O'er his people's hearts to reign."
