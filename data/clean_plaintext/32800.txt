Wonder of these, glory of other times,
O thou whom Envy ev'n is forst t' admire:
Great Patronesse of these my humble Rymes,
Which thou from out thy greatnes doost inspire:
Sith onely thou hast deign'd to raise them higher,
Vouchsafe now to accept them as thine owne,
Begotten by thy hand, and my desire,
Wherein my Zeale, and thy great might is shown.
And seeing this unto the world is knowne,
O leave not, still to grace thy worke in mee:
Let not the quickning seede be over-throwne,
Of that which may be borne to honour thee.
Whereof, the travaile I may challenge mine,
But yet the glory, (Madam) must be thine.
