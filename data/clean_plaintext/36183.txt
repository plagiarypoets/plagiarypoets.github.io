Awake once more, my Harp &mdash; Thy artless tones,
Though rude, may sooth the growling gloom of Care,
With haggard look and bosom-rending moans,
Who, now, assumes the wildness of despair.
And why?  Because her fairy visions fair,
In air dissolving, vanish from the view;
And Speculation's mountain, blasted, bare,
Once more attests the voice of Nature true,
No grandeur stands secure that rests not on the Plough.

How long shall man, by errors meteor gleam
Misled, the phantoms vain of joy pursue?
Each hour be rous'd from the deceitful dream,
Yet labour still th' illusion to renew?
To reason false, to folly only true,
Affliction wounds, experience warns in vain;
Though thousand wrecks the weeping shore bestrew,
The first faint sunbeam lights his hopes again,
And bold he trusts his all to the devouring main.

Of distant lands by Commerce plung'd in wo,
Th' Historic Muse need not be call'd to tell&mdash;
Our eyes have seen her dazzling splendours glow,
Our hearts have heav'd beneath her powerful spell.
And has she not, by each succeeding swell,
Some joy, some virtue, buried in her wave?
Have not her triumphs rung the funeral knell
Of plain Simplicity, of Temperance grave,
With all the Virtues prompt a sinking land to save?

And at her defil'd and faded stream,
Whose ebbing waters mock the thirst-burnt lip,
Do not the many vainly dream
Enjoyment' spure and flowing draughts to dip?
And, still, as one obtains a drumly sip,
Intoxication flashes in his eyes,
And, by his side ten thousand instant strip
And struggling rush, the dusky clouds arise,
Deep groanings rend the earth, and shoutings cleave the skies.

Far from this maddening strife, this wretched toil,
For ever frustrate, and for aye renew'd;
This feverish joy that hangs on Fortune's smile;
These hopes by fear eternally subdued&mdash;
O bear me, Fancy, in thy mildest mood,
And softly sooth me in thy woodland bower,
With heath-bells wild, and simple daisies strew'd&mdash;
With breathing birks enwreath'd, and, full in flower,
The hawthorn blooming gay beyond stern Winter's power.

And in thy faithful mirror, ever clear,
There, let me mark the Seasons gliding by,
The various labours of the circling year,
The swain's solace, the city's rich supply.
And far be envious Care, with jaundic'd eye,
In dingy hues to shade the sylvan scene&mdash;
Nor Affectation breathe her mimic sigh&mdash;
Nor Folly's sentimental face be seen,
Where free and light of heart the rustic youth convene.

Wo was the time, from Eden's blissful bowers,
When driven, with cold and famine to contend,
The hapless pair told o'er the guilty hours,
Assur'd that here their case could never mend.
But God, in midst of judgment, stood their friend,
Preserving, strong, amidst the mental waste,
Whence duty with delight might sweetly blend,
The sympathetic principle of taste,
That hears with joy the spring, with joy the wintry blast.

To Labour health, to Temperance peace of mind,
With their sweet handmaids blithe Content and Joy,
And Competence with Industry he join'd,
And high Refinement wrought with base alloy.
And gay Vicissitude he bade employ
Her active powers the lonely heart to cheer;
And, Care and Pain's fell purpose to destroy,
Gave Fortitude with giant strength to bear,
And Hope o'er all to spread her hues divinely fair.

Hence, o'er the shining share who deigns to bend,
And turn with hands of iron the stubborn soil,
With noxious thorns and thistles to contend
Though heavens of brass appear to mock his toil&mdash;
His are the prayers, and his th' applauding smile
Of every age and sex the world around;
And free from Avarice, free from squint-ey'd Guile,
All lowly though his humble hut be found,
Sweet are his frugal meals, his nightly slumbers sound.

And him the Arts, him all the Virtues hail,
That give to social life its balmy bloom&mdash;
Still, vigorous, as his patient powers prevail,
The nobler thoughts their proper port assume.
And Mercy, Truth, and Justice bright relume
The moral atmosphere, refin'd and clear;
And Learning's smile, and Piety's perfume,
Love's healing balm, and Pity's soothing tear,
Attendant, all pursue his bright, but calm, career.

Grim War, with prancing steeds and rattling wheels,
May, thundering wild, her brazen pomp display;
But modest toil the deadly weapon steels&mdash;
The peaceful Plough supports her awful sway.
Bold Commerce too, with streamers blazing, gay,
In pearl and gold, like old barbaric kings,
Array'd, may boast her liberalizing ray&mdash;
But ask her whence this daring vigour springs?
The Plough, the peaceful Plough, alone can imp her wings.

She is indeed the nursling of the Plough,
And, playful, once a helpless urchin smil'd
On Zoan's fertile field, beneath the glow
Of genial suns, and plenty flowing wild.
And labour there, by drudgery unsoil'd,
Refresh'd by Nile's invigorating wave,
Careless with her his easy hours beguil'd,
And many a comfort, many a joy she gave,
Till, overgrown, at length she chain'd him for her slave.

Then free to rove in verdant fields no more
Cheer'd by the various prospects of the year,
His every day was spent in travail sore,
His spirit crush'd by toils the most severe&mdash;
For Vanity the splendid dome to rear&mdash;
For Luxury the sickly loom to ply&mdash;
For Idols vile, to bid the mountains wear
Ten thousand sculptur'd forms, and, idly high,
The pyramid to raise, huge, heaving to the sky.

Avails him not, o'er all the bustling land,
That riot rings, and florid splendours glow;
These only deeper wreath his iron band,
Or smile, derisive, on his growing wo.
But Vengeance, though she seems to travel slow,
Heavy with foot of iron, once on the way,
Unhesitating moves, nor will forego
One iota, on her retributive day,
Though Wisdom wake at length, and late Repentance pray.

And all that wakes her most relentless mood,
The poor man's cry, the orphan's weeping moan,
All mournful pour'd, while clamouring long and loud,
With shameless front th' oppressor goads them on,
Have reach'd the ear of Him that fills the throne;
Th' Eternal throne which heaven and earth obeys&mdash;
Already, forth the dread decree is gone&mdash;
With ruin fraught th' Assyrian streamer plays,
And rising, dark, behind unnumber'd banners blaze.

Pelusium falls beneath the whelming tide&mdash;
Red over Tanis rolls the burning wave&mdash;
Syene stoops with all her towers of pride,
And, silent, Memphis fills th' oblivious grave.
Nor populous No her hundred gates can save,
Nor idols, temples, palaces and towers&mdash;
The mountain pyramids, alone, can brave
The storm that from the boisterous North devours,
And, dry, the withering wind that burning Libya pours.

But not destroy'd the honours of the Plough,
O'er other lands her peaceful triumphs sped,
And Hope was felt, and Joy's delightful glow,
And the full stores of flowing plenty spread.
And Uz, and Teman's cultur'd dales made glad,
Exulting, felt no more a burning sky;
And over all the blameless patriarch shed,
Such was his worth, his faith, his patience high,
A living lustre bright, on earth that cannot die.

And peaceful ploughmen once made Arnon glad,
And Kir look proudly o'er her corn-clad vales;
Made Heshbon, joyful, lift her flowery head,
And Sibmah's vine perfume the summer gales.
But Kir hath fallen, and Arnon lonely wails,&mdash;
Heshbon and Sibmah, each is but a name&mdash;
O'er Ar, for aye, the curse incurr'd prevails,
Famine and hate, reproach, contempt and shame,
A parching heaven of fire, and winds of burning flame.

Why should I speak of Canaan's promised rest&mdash;
Of snow-white Hermon with her vales around;
Of Carmel, sweet, in flowery verdure drest,
Or Sharon's vale with roses rich imbound&mdash;
Or Gilead for her healing balm renown'd,
Or Eshcol for her grapes of wondrous size,
Or Argob with her threescore cities crown'd,
Or of that Mount, where, glittering to the skies,
Jerusalem's sacred towers were, glorious, seen to rise.

There happiness prolong'd for many an age,
And Glory flourish'd, founded on the Plough;
And Mercy sooth'd the fiercer passions' rage,
And Truth to all held up her mirror true&mdash;
And over all Devotion's holy dew,
In contemplation's placid moments shed,
Bestow'd a grace and grandeur on the view,
Which Envy, mean, with jaundic'd vision fled,
And cold Corruption saw and shook with secret dread.

But a long length of comfortable ease,
Relax'd the nobler virtues' vigorous tone,
And each, subdu'd, sunk down by slow degrees,
Till, unawares, the powers of all were gone.
And tawdry Affectation, shameless, shone,
And Pride, presumptuous, rul'd the evil hour,
And Discontent set up her hideous groan,
While Misery's gathering clouds began to lower,
And Avarice over all assum'd a boundless power.

Then house was heap'd on house, and field to field,
By every art, with care unceasing join'd;
And all of strange, that different climates yield,
In gorgeous robes and luscious draughts combin'd.
And Idleness, on splendid couch reclin'd,
Doz'd to the lyre, or drain'd the genial bowl,
Careless, though rising awful on the wind,
Already with the rain of judgment foul,
Th' oppressor's clamorous cry, the poor man's sorrows roll.

Prophets might threaten, Avarice is deaf!
And to the future Pleasure still is blind!
In ruder wrong alone, that sought relief,
And peace in deeper draughts this hop'd to find.
Till, overgrown, Profanity unrein'd
O'er high and low with lawless license rode,
And, bursting, Ruin's thunderbolt behind,
Burnt up intire their idolized abode,
Which smokes, and still they flee before th' avenging God.&mdash;

Or why my unambitious lay prolong
To tell of Greece, of Carthage, and of Rome?
Of Greece, the lively land of dance and song,
Of cloudless skies and fields of brightest bloom:
But fallen beneath the Tyrant's blasting doom,
Suns shine, winds breathe, and showers distil in vain:
What are the honey'd dews, the high perfume
Hymettus yields, and Tempe's breathing plain,
To him who, hopeless, writhes in slavery's galling chain?&mdash;

Of Carthage, whose light hand was in the sea,
While bold her left on lofty Atlas spread,
With generous heat and active industry,
And plenty's bloom, made sunny Afric glad.
Upon the winds whose blazing banner, dread,
Stream'd like a meteor big with nations' doom;
And once, by peerless skill and valour led,
With ceaseless burning, threaten'd to consume
The adamantine strength of all-subduing Rome.

Of Rome, whose hungry eagles on the wind,
From clime to clime with ravening fury flew,
While Robbery howl'd before, and Death behind
O'er all the shadows of oblivion threw.
Yet, artful, could she breathe o'er all anew,
Not life's full vigour, nor the flush of health,
But something far more gorgeous to the view
Of casual observation caught by stealth,
Disguis'd, the rest of fear &mdash; the tinsel glare of wealth.

But all was hollow &mdash; though the skies were bright,
And all life's summits shone with dazzling glow,
The turbid stream of Misery, on the sight,
Still, deep and dark, for ever toil'd below.
And, though suppress'd, the stifled groan of wo
Still rising, painful, pierc'd the pensive ear,
And wide-extending, life-consuming, slow,
Inspiring coward Shame and trembling Fear,
The fires of Slavery shone, for ever glimmering, drear.

Why should I tell, how in a length of days,
With all her pillar'd strength, her turrets tall,
Push'd, headlong, from her broad ambitious base,
She fell, and Earth was shaken by her fall.
Yet firm as in a band of brass withal,
Immoveable, her iron roots remain'd&mdash;
Though chang'd her voice, resistless still her call
The willing ear of slumb'ring nations gain'd,
While Superstition, Sloth, and Lust, and Murder reign'd&mdash;

Till Learning from her drowsy trance awoke,
And light, resistless, burst the cloister'd cell&mdash;
And, heaven-inspir'd, one mighty spirit broke,
With angel strength, her soul enslaving spell&mdash;
Nor will I stay her dark intrigues to tell,
Her ravings wild, her anathemas dire,
Which wicked men took up with frantic yell,
And o'er the nations, with infernal ire,
Pour'd mountain waves of blood, and scatter'd showers of fire&mdash;

Nor, how a Tyrant's appetative mood,
Still unappeas'd, and shifting every hour,
Despis'd, or over-stubbornly withstood,
Set England's blushing Rose beyond her power.
Which, tho', at times, a cloud might darkling lower,
Hath, ever since, been brightening in its bloom,
And darting, deep and wide, its roots of power,
Till Continents can scantly give it room,
And earth's remotest Isles inhale its rich perfume!

And thou, my Country!  Caledonia, hail!
Though bleak thy hills, and boisterous be thy shore,
Though, towering high, thy Sister's fame prevail,
And thou 'mong nations lift'st thy voice no more&mdash;
Time was thou too couldst boast of royal power&mdash;
The Patriot Prince and gifted Seer were thine,
Who, strong, in danger's overwhelming hour,
Did hand to hand with dauntless ardour join,
O'er thy wild glens to pour the light of Truth divine.

And heaven upon the high emprise did smile&mdash;
Thy royal splendours all have pass'd away,
But, in despite of either force or guile,
Their labours bless thee to this very day:
Thy simple Institutions, still, display
The bright conceptions of their mighty mind,
And Labour smiles, and Poverty looks gay,
And poor Misfortune dries her tears to find,
Truth, Mercy, Light, and Law, and Liberty combin'd.

But, O!  beware, lest any thought of pride,
When looking at the course which thou hast run,
In thy own wisdom lead thee to confide,
And claim the merit due as all thine own.
Nor think, for thee, these gifts were cheaply won&mdash;
No, they were earn'd with tears, and toils, and blood:
Power's minions all in opposition shone,
And on their side, defiance breathing loud,
With dreadful tortures arm'd, gaunt Persecution stood.

Though Murrays, Loudons, Warristons, Argyles,
Knoxes and Melvilles, Guthries and Cargills,
And Kids, and Kings, and Camerons, and M'Kails,
And Welches, have adorned thy heath-clad hills.
Yet thou hast had (authors of nameless ills)
Thy Sharps and Beatons, bloodthirsty and base;
Thy Rotheses, M'Kenzies and Dalzels,
Foul names, accurs'd to all succeeding days:
And one incarnate fiend in Graham thy page displays.

These, the vile tools of a perverted Race,
Whom mercy could not melt, nor judgment awe,
For ever straining after Rome's embrace,
And substituting headstrong will for law.
Till heaven, at length, thy deep affliction saw,
And from their heights the maudling miscreants hurl'd,
Giving thee to the rule of great Nassau,
Who Freedom's flag with Royal hands unfurl'd,
And while he bless'd thee, shed blessing round the world.

And under Brunswick's venerable line,
Thy blessings all have had a large increase&mdash;
How bold soe'er thy foes, afar, combine,
Thy vales are still th' abodes of joy and peace.
Is there a heart from fervent praise can cease
That sees thy stream of tranquil pleasure flow?
That sees forlorn sterility give place
To all the generous labours of the Plough,
And hills and dales reflect Industry's cheerful glow?

While yet the year, deep in her wintry trance,
Nor sees, nor hears, nor feels th' approaching spring;
And rudely, still, the boreal storms advance,
The sleet-shower shaking from tempestuous wing;
Ere yet the lark essays to soar or sing,
But, feebly, cowering seeks the sounding shore,
Where flowing tides from viewless caverns fling
The shell-clad morsel, he can, quiet, devour,
Nor in wild tones contend with Ocean's wilder roar.

And, congregating still, a jarring crowd,
The linnets chattering shake the naked tree,
And the gay merle, and mellow mavis, brood
In hedge-row sad, or round the farm-yard flee.
O!  then, when all is sickening sad to see,
On feeling hearts how powerful is the charm,
Borne up the vale, the jolly Ploughman's glee,
On yonder sunny slope, sequester'd, warm,
As by the red-breast cheer'd, again he breaks his farm.

Even when the storm, dark, brooding on the hill,
With languor deep weighs down the listless day,
Uncheer'd, save by the bubbling of the rill,
That ebbing soft, keeps trickling on its way;
A feeling, half approaching to the gay,
Springs up, to see the plough advancing strong&mdash;
Through the deep mist, that up the valley gray
In masses deep, sails huge and slow along,
To hear the snorting steeds &mdash; the gaudsman's simple song.

Nor unattended &mdash; even on such a day
Some yet mute warbler, patient, plods along
The new made furrow, eager for his prey,
A few days hence to be repaid in song.
And, foraging, the broken clods among,
In tyes of equal love perpetual bound,
The hooded crow, on sable pinions, strong,
With his dull mate keeps sailing round and round,
While, to his rusty caw, the echoing rocks rebound.

But brighter days approach &mdash; The joyous Morn
From the gay chambers of the cloudless sky,
Looks out with light and life.  Her mantle dun,
Rejoicing Earth, for living green lays by.
And, sweet, the early flower, of loveliest dye,
Blooms, odour-breathing, on the sunward slope&mdash;
Soft wing'd abroad the westring breezes fly&mdash;
With genial dew mild Eve begins to drop,
And trees, and flowers, and fields put forth the buds of Hope.

'Tis now that pleasure waits upon the Plough&mdash;
High heaven resounds the lark's wild melody,
And the bland air gives out the living glow,
Active with life and fervid energy.
The leaves, as yet, but scantly clothe the tree,
The fields, but scantly, yield the honey'd flower;
But, on the clustering palms, the busy bee,
With eident hum, employs the sunny hour,
To heap his hoarded bread, or swell his waxen store.

Forth, to the joyous labours of the field,
The household hasten at the master's call;
Some bear the precious seed, some patient wield
The needful spade, some beat the furrow small.
And, light of heart, good-humour smiles on all&mdash;
The soil, the season, and the labour new;
For very joy the children, noisy, brawl,
And still their ardour bursts afresh, to view
The dog, from field to field the pilfering rooks pursue.

And soon approaching, gladsome, jolly May,
With the full flush of buds, and leaves, and flowers,
And the full choir of woodland music gay,
From morn to even with rapture fills the hours.
And lovely June, with dews and genial showers,
Calls forth the softest green, the liveliest bloom;
While, silent, in her ivy-mantled bowers,
'Mong clustering roses hid, she breathes perfume,
And sees, rejoicing, Earth her liveries rich assume.

July behind, all blowz'd with native heat,
Half breathless, paces slow th' umbrageous shade,
And scatters, wide, the cooling berry, sweet,
Of deepest blue, or blushing purply red.
And in her breath, matur'd, with heavy head,
Earthward the wheat, full-ear'd, begins to tend,
While to the orchard, fair, with fruitage spread,
A yellow tinge her touch begins to lend,
And bow'd, by slow degrees, the laden branches bend.

August, at length, in robes of purple dye,
Most gorgeous, over moor and mountain glides,
And plenty flows, responsive to her sigh,
Wide, o'er the yellow vale in wavy tides:
And, while in clouds her portly form she hides,
Or rushes, hollow, through the forest sear,
With prudent care the husbandman provides,
To save the precious products of the year,
The solace of his toils, his hopes for winter drear.

September comes, with dogs and thundering guns,
Re-echoing to the ardent sportsman's noise;
And keen, through all, her fervid spirit runs,
Resuscitating spring's delightful joys.
The skies are clear, and no dark thought destroys
Creation's joy with views of future pain;
The merle once more her mellow pipe employs,
The lark to heaven's gate bears her song again,
And, sweet, the linnet swells the reaper's joyous strain.

Till pale October, in her robes of brown,
Lifts, dowie, on the world her weeping eye,
And Nature's voice, in forest, dale, and down,
Sinks dull into a melancholy sigh.
The sobbing blast, the sear leaf rustling by,
The distant waterfall's portentous swell;
The voice that sweeps, responsive, o'er the sky,
Re-echo'd far, from yonder misty fell,
Bid to the passing year a long, a sad farewell.

Yet lingering still, most delicately sweet,
Flowers here and there put forth their pensive bloom;
And on the bank that fronts the noonday heat,
Still crackles on the ear th' expanding broom.
And still the redbreast, with unruffled plume,
Continues, wild, his warblings from the tree,
Which cheers the simple cottar's Harvest-home,
That knows no higher feast or revelry,
Save from the heart to heaven the warm thought rushing free.

Now Ease and Plenty smile upon the farm,
For all its labours for the year are done;
The yard is stacked full, and each from harm
Secur'd by coverings, carefully put on.
And on that little spot his hands have won,
By skilful toil from the surrounding waste,
Cheer'd by a mild and bright October sun,
The cottar and his smiling inmates haste,
Now others' crops are saved, to save their own at last.

The children, laid among a heap of sheaves,
In artless pastime sport away the hours,
Trace with delight the slowly falling leaves,
Or re-arrange the wreath of simple flowers.
Mean time the mother, active, plies her powers,
The husband and the father's toil to aid;
And ere the dark'ning hour of gloaming lowers,
So happily their parts are mutual play'd,
That safe in hutted rows the whole is fair array'd.

And drear November finds them full prepar'd&mdash;
For calf and cow is fodder laid in store,
Potato-bings, and corn-stack in the yard,
Keep far away lean Hunger from their door.
Work lies around them, and the rainy hour,
And lengthen'd night, their converse gay must charm;
Parental cares, affection's tender power,
And meek devotion's ardour ever warm,
Forbid the languid powers their peaceful hearts to harm.

Much do I envy thee, thou happy swain,
Although thy toils are constant and severe,
Thy gettings small, thy table very plain,
Thy dwelling through the winter somewhat drear&mdash;
Despairing Wretchedness thou canst not hear,
Perverse Stupidity thou dost not see;
The infectious breath of Vice thou need'st not fear,
Surrounded thus by sweet simplicity,
Unscath'd, thy virtues bud, and bloom and ripen free.

The deep reverse thy heart hath never torn;
With strangers, lonely, never hast thou pined;
These very stones thy infant steps have worn;
Thy days behind that hill have all declin'd.
Splendour and wealth, with mean deceit combin'd,
And flaming zeal, with villany and lust,
Have never rous'd thy rage against mankind;
Nor hollow Friendship plung'd, with deadly thrust,
Deep in thy aching breast, the dagger of distrust.

Acquaintance thou canst claim with every tree,
These winds &mdash; that stream, hath always sooth'd thy ears;
A friend thou canst in every mountain see,
And some old thought of thine each echo bears!
Grown with thy strength, and strengthening with thy years,
Around thy heart these prepossessions twine&mdash;
Let no low sophist, on thy casual fears
Strong working, cause their vigour to decline,
Or lead thee, bold, to scorn their voice and power divine.

Ah!  do not thou thy equal temper lose,
To see yon subtle huckster, soft and sleek,
Display his portly paunch, his ruby nose,
It may be twice a year, or once a week.
He lives and thrives by arts would make thee sick&mdash;
Has weather'd storms had driven thee to despair&mdash;
And though he bears an outward aspect meek,
Couldst thou behold his rotten heart laid bare,
Thy every nerve would shake to see what labours there!

In embryo, there, are plots to catch his friend&mdash;
Schemes new and strange to grind the bleeding poor&mdash;
With prayers and tears, the public eye to blind,
And charities to make his run secure.
And Hope, aspiring, glads his distant hour,
With gold, and lands, and houses fair to see;
Till Conscience, rous'd, puts forth her awful power&mdash;
Dispers'd, at once, the glittering visions flee!
And rises, dark, the jail, the judge, the gallows-tree.

A few short years, have patience &mdash; thou mayst see
This green and growing, self-sufficient one,
With downcast looks and tremor-stricken knee,
To want abandon'd, hopeless and alone&mdash;
Or among menials mean, all wo-begone,
The veriest drudge, the most compliant slave,
Eager for rest on earth, but, finding none,
Brought on his knees at last, of Heaven to crave
The poor man's last sad hope, that narrow house the grave.

For his apparent ease couldst thou forego
The joy and health which to thy toils are given?
For all his fancied wealth th' entrancing glow
That rushes on thy heart at fall of even?
But above all thy intercourse with heaven,
The powers, transforming, of the world unseen,
Couldst thou exchange for his unrighteous leaven,
His sordid joys and aims, his prospects lean?
Thou art not, sure, so base, so despicably mean!

Beware th' insidious tales of discontent,
Which maudlin Faction echoes to the sky,
Of wrested rights, of Constitutions rent,
Exhausted Art, and Nature's channels dry!
And the wild dream of other worlds that lie,
For ever bright with Hope's entrancing smile,
Beyond the vasty deep &mdash; where, mantling high,
The cup of joy prevents the sigh of toil,
And simple Truth ne'er rues the thorny snares of Guile!

So thou mayst dream, and dreaming, mayst forego,
All that gives balm to life's expanding bloom;
But when thou wak'st, thou wak'st to deeper wo,
And heavier toils shall surely be thy doom,
Immur'd, amid the overwhelming gloom
Of boundless woods, to heaven outstretching drear,
Where sobbing winds, the rivers ceaseless boom,
Which thy lone axe but little helps to cheer,
Unbroke, for ever soothes dark Solitude's dull ear.

Or, if 'tis broke, 'tis by the condor's wing,
Who stoops to make thy household fowls his prey;
Or jaguar's growl, as with unerring spring,
Of thy small flock the best he bears away&mdash;
Or huge snake's hiss, as hollow rustling, gray,
Through the rank weeds he bursts upon the sight;
And thou stand'st, petrified, a lump of clay&mdash;
Or the red savage, who, at dead of night,
Strikes up the warwhoop wild, the death-fire's dismal light.

Nor is this all &mdash; from stagnant waters, vast,
And putrid marshes steaming on the day,
Miasma, viewless, creeps across the waste,
And steals, resistless, on thy secret way.
The breathing morn, no longer beaming gay,
With joy and health invigorates thy frame;
The gloom of death hangs, dim, on twilight gray,
Recedes the sun, blank with the blush of shame,
Or, fired to fury, burns a life-consuming flame.

But should the God whose presence thou hast fled,
Thy father's God, with love pursue thee still,
The balm of health around thy dwelling shed,
And make thee blest almost against thy will:
Should He forbid the bloated snake to kill,
The wolf, the bear, and jaguar to devour,
Rein the wild winds, avert the blighting chill
Of the cold North, and, in the lonely hour,
The savage bosom melt, or blast his arm of power:

Will Joy for aye light up thy beaming eye,
And Gratitude thy glowing breast inspire?
Will cheerless Silence, or the lonely sigh,
Still keep awake Devotion's holy fire?
The bread of life thy soul may strong desire,
Unfed while plenty flows on every hand;
Of Sympathy and Faith thou mayst require
The soothing prayer &mdash; but vain is the demand,
Nor prayer, nor praise is heard through all that dismal land!

No cheerful hum of city, ether borne,
No village pipe is heard, melodious, there,
No silver-sounding bell on Sabbath morn,
Announces, sweet, the coming hour of prayer.
No neighbours meeting, kind, for Church prepare,
With converse to beguile the tedious way,
No man of God is waiting to declare
Heaven's peace to man the sinful child of clay&mdash;
The rich rewards laid up for Glory's coming day!

No Angel forms, descending from on high,
Gave there the pattern of the world to come;
No Prophet's voice, with heaven's dread energy,
Burst the thick cloud that overhangs the tomb:
But underneath the sinner's fearful doom,
From day to day the sinking savage pin'd;
Still deepening round him Superstition's gloom;
Failing each power, each nobler sense refin'd,
Till, huge, the growing brute absorb'd th' immortal mind.

No fields of fame, no stones of triumph there,
Awake the flame of glory's slumbering fire;
Quench'd in the ever-deepening clouds of care,
Fine feelings fail, and nobler thoughts expire.
The hapless land Jehovah, in his ire,
For many an age, kept secret as the grave;
What light, 'tis vain for History to inquire,
Tradition old, or infant Science gave,
O'er all, alike, hath roll'd Oblivion's darkest wave.

There the poor outcast, from his native land
By desperate fortune driven, or secret guile
Seduc'd, looks wistfully on every hand,
For images to sooth his lonely toil.
And though, nor mountain swell, nor valley smile,
Nor river rolling like his own be found,
Names grateful to his ear imposed, the while,
On sluggish streams, and sullen flats around,
Reluctant, lend, but lend in vain, their magic sound.

These wretched huts Saint Johnston he may name,
That ocean-stream surrounding them, the Tay,
But all th' associations dear to Fame,
And to his heart, alas!  are far away.
On Grampian hills 'tis other winds that stray,
Soft whispering through Dunkelden's birken bowers;
In Gowrie's vale far other echoes stray,
What time, with dewy feet, the evening Hours,
With rural pastimes gay, trip o'er the breathing flowers.

Let restless Discontent, or lust for wealth,
Roam round the world on Vanity's light wings,
Burst Nature's tenderest ties, sell honour, health,
And Heaven's bright hopes, for earth's decaying things.
Give me the rest which meek Contentment brings,
My warmest thoughts the world to come employ,
And, pure outwelling, from my native springs,
Untinged with pride, or slavery's base alloy,
With honest Labour quaff the cup of genuine joy.

Say, thou who Fortune's high career hast run,
To darling gold devoted from the womb,
Who, bold, hast dar'd the poles, the burning zone,
And 'scap'd as 'twere by miracle the tomb:
Can this same gold restore thy blasted bloom?
Can townships, honour, feeling, truth, supply?
Can all thy numerous slaves again relume
These features wan &mdash; that shrank lack-lustre eye?
A deep despairing groan is all thy poor reply.

Creation's boldest scenes thou mayst have trod,
Paraguay, and the vales of rich Peru,
From high Himalech cast thine eyes abroad,
Where sunny Cashmere glows upon the view:
Thou mayst have roam'd thro' ardent Afric too,
Where Nature, ever verdant, keeps her reign;
But, stubborn, to thy wretched purpose true,
Except they led the way to certain gain,
Thy sordid soul beheld, and spurn'd them with disdain.

The poor inhabitant thou might'st have bless'd,
Taught him to till the soil, to stem the wave,
Or open'd on his eye those regions vast,
That rise in light beyond the gloomy grave.
But thine was not the errand, meek, to save;
Thou foundst him poor, but leftst him more forlorn&mdash;
Perhaps, to be for aye thy weeping slave,
His back with stripes, his hands with labour worn,
From all his soul held dear, relentless, he was torn.

Why dost thou start to hear the passing wind,
That lingers, playful, on the leafy tree?
Why wake thy fears, with circumspection join'd
Amid the peaceful peasants' harmless glee?
Alas!  alas!  'tis now in vain, for thee,
That the gay Dawn lifts up her joyous eyes&mdash;
That Nature bounds to her wild melody&mdash;
For, in thy breast, matur'd guilt's offspring lies,
His endless toils begun, the worm that never dies.

Nor long on thee shall Morn reluctant smile&mdash;
Nor thou remain on God's fair world a blot;
Tho' Patience pause, the Grave expands the while,
And kindling, Tophet yawns more fiery hot.
One little hour, behold!  and thou art not&mdash;
Thy name, thy dwelling-place hath pass'd away&mdash;
And, even thy very crimes, on earth forgot,
Have ceas'd, with foul and ulcerous display,
To shock the feeling heart, and blur the beams of day.

Hast thou, O England!  nerves of temper'd steel?
Is thy iron heart in triple brass enclos'd?
Thy conscience sear'd compunction ne'er to feel,
For wretchedness on half the world impos'd?
With sounding names thy traffic may be gloz'd,
But, ah!  thy ever-grasping hands are foul;
With Vanity's vile fumes thou may'st be doz'd,
And, fearless, though the heavens vindictive scowl,
The gloomy wastes of Earth for prey insatiate prowl&mdash;

But blood is  in thy skirts, and in thy street
Th' appalling voice of violence and guile;
In midst of thee each vile affection meets,
And all the wasting passions, ceaseless, boil.
And pamper'd Idleness, and famish'd Toil,
In fronted opposition, scowling, sit,
And C*****ts, W****rs, H**ts, and H**es, the while,
Thy bleeding sores with venom'd caustic fret,
And hope, and watch, and urge, the coming deadly fit.

Thy Name is on the winds, and round the earth
The glory of thy Arts and Arms is borne;
And Truth, from thee, celestial, hath gone forth
In all the glorious attributes of morn.
But sons of thine, most cruelly have torn,
The page that should transmit thy spotless fame,
And, unappeas'd, would yet defile thy horn,
And set thee, helpless, naked, blind and lame,
To Heaven and Earth expos'd, a monument of shame.

Thy loosen'd loins, O!  gird them up with truth;
With temper'd justice arm thy fearless hands;
Let ardent zeal inspire the glow of youth,
And mercy light thee into other lands.
Nor laugh to scorn what Nature's voice demands,
Instruction, bread, protection for the poor&mdash;
Relentless, break th' Oppressor's iron bands,
So, stable may thy mountain stand secure,
Unshaken, unremov'd, in Judgment's darkest hour.

And thou, O Scotia!  dweller with the storm,
Whom God hath yet vouchsaf'd peculiar grace;
Why gaddst thou too abroad, proud to deform
With all thy gairish sister's blots thy face?
The phantoms of delirious Joy to chase,
Why art thou rushing from thy pastoral hills?
Why toil to reap a harvest of disgrace&mdash;
Or, wild, afar contend with cureless ills,
While, solitary, flow thy health-inspiring rills?

'Mong all thy sons of daring, is there none
Will fearless rise the wasting plague to stay?
Of all that wish thee well, is there not one
Will labour to prolong thy evening ray?
But late, indeed, thy Bonnet's proud display,
Thy gleamy steel, thy tartans waving blue,
And thy wild Pibroch, scatter'd wild dismay,
O'er that red field where Vengeance had her due,
And pride was cloth'd with shame &mdash; immortal Waterloo.

But when the war-worn vet'ran comes to tell,
His hairbreadth 'scapes, with all the toils he bore;
Alas!  how must his manly bosom swell,
To find his native hamlet is no more.
Silence is in the glen where, heretofore,
The pipe was wont the gloaming hour to cheer;
Far, far away the wand'ring inmates, poor,
Of heartless life, the hopeless remnants wear,
By Susquehanna, wild, or Niagara drear.

Wild, to the wind thy glories, there, they sing,
Enhancing what again they ne'er can see,
And, often, borne on Fancy's glowing wing,
By thy clear springs renew their youthful glee.
Unceasing, too, they toil, but unto thee,
Nor honour, no, nor profit shall redound;
Their virtues and their talents soon may be,
While thou sitst, lonely, humbled to the ground,
Rich on thy rival's brow, in well-earn'd laurels, found.

Thy barren hills, like Judah's favour'd land,
Have, largely, drunk of Heaven's refreshing dew,
And, in her paths persisting still to stand,
Shalt thou not drink her cup of judgment too?
And deeper far &mdash; Her splendours to renew,
Jehovah, by Himself, hath solemn sworn&mdash;
Sharon shall bud, and, green upon the view,
No more to bear the heathen's spiteful scorn,
Bashan and Carmel blush, beneath the beaming morn.

But thou, though glorious like the Prince of Tyre,
In wisdom great, with perfect beauty crown'd,
Allow'd to walk among the stones of fire,
And traverse blissful Eden's hallow'd ground&mdash;
If, as thy wealth, thy wantonness abound,
And, rising still, thy violence and pride,
Upon thy head draw down the mortal wound,
Who then, alas!  thy failing steps shall guide&mdash;
For thee, nor second Spring, nor Summer months abide.

And is not God, to judgment, on his way?
And wilt thou, still, the charge of guilt refuse?
Hast thou still sacred held his word and day,
And kept inviolate thy solemn vows?
May He not, now, thy strong delusions choose,
And give thee up to trust upon a lie?
Leave thee, still more, thy mercies to abuse,
Till, void of shame, Devotion's urn run dry,
For God all reverence fail, and Form with Feeling die.

But, void of heart, an outcast from thy place,
Or an encumbrance vile though thou art found,
Still on its course shall flow the stream of grace,
Though Tay, nor Forth, nor Tweeda swell the sound.
Earth's dreary wilds with darkness deep embound,
Th' abhorr'd abodes of cruelty and dread&mdash;
Her solitudes with desolation crown'd,
Shall hear the rushing waters and be glad,
And herbs shall, budding, spring, and flowery verdure spread.

And Strife shall cease, and Poverty shall smile,
And Industry to Idleness succeed;
And Rest shall reap respect and joy from toil,
While healthful Temperance deals her daily bread.
And Charity her healing hand shall spread,
With liberal heart, on every form of wo;
And Competence, by warm Devotion led,
Cheer'd and supported by the peaceful Plough,
Through every feeling heart shall pour her rapt'rous glow.

Be still, my Harp &mdash; The bolt of Heaven has sped,
And, in amazement, shakes the smitten throne,
The loveliest form, the tenderest heart has bled,
And the fair flower of England's hope is gone!
And with th' Illustrious Stranger, widow'd, lone,
The voice of wailing spreads from hill to hill,
The lengthen'd vales sends back the deepening tone,
On the pain'd ear, with melancholy thrill&mdash;
Be hush'd, my feeble Harp &mdash; thy jarring tones be still.
