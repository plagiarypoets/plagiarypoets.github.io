The noble heart, that, panting with disdain,
Doth lack to hear the tuneful trumpet blow,
Can ill abide upon the peaceful plain,
Or taste the poor delights, that shepherds know:
Nor can the shepherd, from his station low,
Delight in greatness, and unstable state,
But, pleased with the pleasant sounds, that flow
From his small pipe, the lofty life doth hate:
Yet nathless Love, that not a whit will bait
From his full empire, doth them both controul,
And, clothing their stiff necks with golden weight
Of his sweet yoke, doth reign in either soul:
The proud oftimes he leads to lowly plain,
And plants the humble in uncertain reign.
