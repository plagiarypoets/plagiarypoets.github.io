Now ev'ning dim appears &mdash; that much lov'd hour
Of sweet tranquility and rural ease:
When far afield is heard,
The ploughman's simple song;

And from the bean-field sings the lab'ring bee,
Warn'd homeward, by the coming shades of night,
And dews that gently fall
On ev'ry drooping flow'r.

With Contemplation let me seek to dwell,
In wild romantic vale, or ruin dark,
Where the swift-circling bat
Hits in the twilight way.

And oft in sheep-cote near, the pleasing sound
Of warning-bell is heard; as Philomel,
In Echo's mournful haunts,
Sings her sad tale of woe.

Or if by musing mem'ry fondly led
To poor Matilda's turf of fading flowers,
Meet me in holy guise,
O, Maid!  rever'd by those

Who love to shed affection's hallow'd tears,
Unmark'd at night, when through the fleecy clouds,
That veil her azure sphere,
The wan moon dimly shines.

But when drear Winter saddens all the plain,
And by the cheerful fire, at close of day,
I hear the bleak winds mourn,
Around my reed-thatch'd hut;

The Muse my lonely hours shall oft beguile;
And thou, sweet maid, the willing mind shalt store
With pity, meek content,
And friendship's sacred law.

As night appears, big with the wintry storm,
Then shall the glimm'ring lamp, with cheer ray,
Beam o'er the neigh'bring plain,
Or mountain's lonely side:

For oft poor travellers benighted stray,
Wide of the village path, at that dark hour,
When not a watch-dog barks,
No distant sheep-bell sounds.

Or ling'ring onward, fear the chasm's depth,
Conceal'd by drifted snow; as the cold blast
Howls through the leafless thorn,
And windings of the steep.
