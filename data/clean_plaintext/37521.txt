Here sleeps great PITT, who went to rest,
By Britain's warmest wishes blest;
The genius of her happier years,
And now immortal in her tears.

Here Honour comes, a pilgrim grey,
To bless the earth that wraps his clay;
And Freedom, while alive, will come,
A weeping hermit o'er this tomb;
Bewailing sad a nobler sod,
Than Fancy's feet  have ever trod.
