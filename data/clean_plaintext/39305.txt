Not always, dear Licinius, is it wise
On the main sea to ply the daring oar;
Nor is it safe, in dread of angry skies,
To keep too near to the perfidious shore.
To no excess discerning spirits lean;
They feel the blessings of the golden mean;
They will not grovel in the squalid cell,
Nor seek in royal domes, with envied pomp to dwell.

The pine, that lifts so high her stately bough,
Writhes in the storms, and withers in their blight,
Which o'er the neighbouring trees innoxious blow,
That wave their branches in an humbler height.
As the loud fury of the whirlwind pours,
With direct ruin fall the loftiest towers;
And 'tis the mountain's summit that, oblique,
From the dark lurid clouds, the baleful lightnings strike.

The Mind, well disciplined, when Sorrow lowers,
Chears her pale eye with Hope's enlivening rays;
And when soft Pleasure boasts of lasting powers,
With jealous doubt the promiser surveys.
It is the same dread Jove, that thro' the sky
Hurls the loud storms, that darken as they fly;
And whose benignant hand withdraws the gloom,
And spreads rekindling light in all its living bloom.

To-day the soul perceives a weight of woe;
A whiter morrow shall gay thoughts inspire;
Does Phoebus always been the vengeful bow?
Wakes he not often the harmonious lyre?
Be thou, when danger scowls in every wave,
Watchful, collected, spirited, and brave;
But in the sunny skies, the flattering gales,
Contract, with steady hand, thy too-expanding sails.
