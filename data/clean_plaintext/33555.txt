Now hast thou silenc'd Slander, par'd the clawes
O'th Blatant Beast, and given Gallia cause
To curse her fond misprission, and apply
Her selfe to thee, (great Lord of Loyaltie)
Not long agoe twas hop'd a fine pretence
Should send thee to the Land of Diffidence,
&mdash;But by thy skill
The Scene is chang'd, ascend (great Sir) untill
Thy loyall head knock 'gainst the arched skie,
While the Iberians howle thy memory.
