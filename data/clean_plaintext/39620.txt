The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
The post-boy gallops briskly o'er the lea,
The pressman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves his place to darkness, and to me.

Now fades the glimmering twilight on the sight,
And all the room a solemn stillness holds,
Save where the wasp hums from the ceiling's height,
And crickets chirrup from their distant holes;

Save that from yonder nest, beneath the floor,
The nibbling mouse does all alone complain
That she, amid her hard-earned, scanty store,
Can find, for all her labour, little gain.

Beneath those rugged stands, that galley's shade,
Where lies the dust in many a little heap,
Each in its narrow cell neglected laid,
The old progenitors of libels sleep.

The brawling speech from demagogue forlorn,
The poet spinning verses from his head,
The news-man's "bloody news," the post-boy's horn,
No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.

For them no more the midnight lamp shall burn,
Or busy scribbler ply his evening care;
No devils run to wait the proof's return,
Nor dance attendance round an author's chair.

Oft did Delusion to their prowess yield;
Their labours oft the shield of vice have broke;
In mighty columns, how they took the field!
How bow'd the knave beneath their sturdy stroke!

Let not ambition mock their useful toil,
Their humble works, and destiny obscure;
Nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile,
The short and simple annals of the poor.
