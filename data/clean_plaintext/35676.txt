O thou, whose touch creative bids appear
The dear resemblance of each absent friend,
Whose faithful pencil prompts the swelling tear,
As o'er departed worth we sorrowing bend:
Accept the strain which Friendship bids ascend,
To pour the notes of Memory's grateful song&mdash;
And while the thoughts to fond affection tend,
Oh could my ardent prayers thy years prolong,
Blest with the smiles of Health, and vigour strong;
Then should thy fancy long 'mid Painting's bower
Vie with thy Romney's his own scenes among,
Then shalt thou long enjoy the Classic hour,
Whilst thy young Bard, whose rising powers expand,
Shall consecrate thy Name in many a distant land.
