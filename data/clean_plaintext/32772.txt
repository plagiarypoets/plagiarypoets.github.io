When with the dawning of my first delight
The day light of loves delycasie mov'd me
Then from my heavens disdainfull starrie light
The moone-light of her chastitie reprov'd me
Her forheads threatfull cloudes from hope remov'd me
Till midnight rear'd on the mid-noctiall line
Her hart whiles pities sleight had undershov'd me
Then did I force her downward to decline
Till dawning day light chearefully did shine
And by such happie revolution drew
Her mornings blush to joyfull smiles encline
And now Meridian heate dries up my dewe
There rest faire Planets stay bright orbes of heaven
Still smiling at my dyall next eleven.
