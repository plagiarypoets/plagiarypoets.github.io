Embark'd, the vessel cuts the glassy deep,
Whose waves reflect Aurora's rosy smile;
Around, all nature wakes from nightly sleep;
The mast-boy sings, devoid of fear and guile:
Grey mists sublimely shroud Britannia's Isle,
Whose tall cliffs lessen to the gazing eye;
Now, now they "bluely fade," and all is sea and sky.

So dawn'd the morning of Calista's life&mdash;
Cloudless, serene, and grandly wide its view:
Such was it still, when Edwin's lovely wife,
Willing, she vow'd to be forever true;
E'en then that life assum'd a brighter hue:
But ah!  the sad reverse, ye fair! bemoan;
Avoid Calista's crimes, nor make her fate your own.
