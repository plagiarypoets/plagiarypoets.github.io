Who have been great, in this our mortal clime,
Begirt around by the loud-voiced sea?
Why sacred Chaucer, that, in homely rhyme,
First held the lamp up to Posterity:
Then Spenser, in whose rich Virgilian strain,
The moral Virtues are disposed fair:
Then glorious Milton, who surpass'd his reign
In depths of Hell, and in th' Olympic air:
But, most of all, and to our wond'ring eyes,'
And to the eyes of all futurity,
Great Shakespeare stands, that was by Nature wise,
And made a spoil of his posterity;
When he was born, great Nature did her most,
And when he died, the World's delight was lost!
