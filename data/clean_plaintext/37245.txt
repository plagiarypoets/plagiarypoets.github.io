By Hudson's stream I stand:  ah!  not inspir'd
As when in youth my yielding spirit could take
The stamp of nature's beauty, and was fir'd
By the warm impress.  Oh!  when sorrows make
Man's heart the home of thoughts that ne'er forsake
The self-made wretched, rove his eyes in vain
O'er nature's magic page!  she cannot break,
E'en with her spells of power, the two-fold chain
That links the soul to wo, the wasted frame to pain.

Let others view thee, Hudson, in this hour,
That poets love, the last of day's decline,
Urging thy water-steeds in beauty and power
Beneath the rude Matawan's length'ning line;
I cannot bow in peace at nature's shrine,
Nor feel, e'en in this speaking solitude,
Thy loveliness around my bosom twine;&mdash;
Suit not thy charms a heart by grief subdu'd,&mdash;
By woes that cannot weep, and vain regrets pursu'd.

Yet parting day smiles sweetly on thy cheek,
Fair Hudson, and his glowing fingers throw
A lovely mantle o'er thee; and in meek
And quiet beauty on thy burnish'd brow
Glitter the gems of heav'n; thy tresses flow
In liquid amber. &mdash; Streaming to the eye,
Like hosts of fire, thy guardian mountains glow,
Around the sun's fast-falling throne on high,
Rearing their crested helms, in cloudy panoply.

They cannot shield the glories that must fade
In night's oblivion!  I will look no more
Upon thy waters &mdash; do they not upbraid
My spirit with their peace?  e'en since I bore
The name of man, and through th' expanding door
Of the bright future chased those shapes of air,
That lured to hopes they left me to deplore;
No balm doth Nature bring me; &mdash; when I bare
My bosom's wounds, she smiles, and mocks the anguish there!
