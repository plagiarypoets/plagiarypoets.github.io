Wo worth the man, who in ill hour assay'd
To tempt that Western Frith with vent'rous keel,
And seek what heav'n, regardful of our weal,
Had hid in fogs, and night's eternal shade;
Ill-starr'd Hibernia!  well art thou appaid
For all the woes, which Britain made thee feel
By Henry's wrath, and Pembroke's conqu'ring steel,
Who sack'd thy towns, and castles disarray'd:
No longer now with idle sorrow mourn
Thy plunder'd wealth, or liberties restrain'd,
Nor deem their victories thy loss or shame;
Severe revenge on Britain in thy turn
And ample spoils thy treach'rous waves obtain'd,
Which sunk one half of Spenser's deathless fame.
