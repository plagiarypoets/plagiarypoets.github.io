Sad child, by frowning poverty deprest,
With vestment dank, and wildly-dripping hair,
The prey of ev'ry blast,
Hurl'd in the tempest round.

Ah torn, perhaps, ah torn, in infant years,
From tender parents, and from shelt'ring home,
How throbs thy guileless breast,
Made bare by the rude wind!

The laughing Loves forsake thy radiant eyes,
Yet piteous leave their brilliants on thy lids,
Which chase each other down,
In glitt'ring drops of woe.

Ah harmless boy!  yet doom'd to suffer pain,
To hear loud cordage lash the groaning mast,
While wat'ry mountains huge
Roar dread destruction round.

Ah!  hapless!  born to give thy little life
To the wide-gaping sea, or mingling storm;
Or 'mid the fractur'd wrecks,
Or floating corses pale,

'Tis thine, to hear hoarse seamen's dying groans,
To witness heaps of hanging waters dire,
When steers with belly'd sail
No friendly saving bark.

'Tis thine, perhaps, to die in deserts wild,
Where no fond parent soothes thy parting soul!
Unknown, to die unblest,
A naked bleaching corse,

That owns no decent grave, no letter'd pile,
But doom'd the prey of fierce voracious fowls
While friends may ardent wish,
Yet strangers to thy fate,

The safe return of injur'd innocence!
When thou, perhaps, no more wilt e're return,
To taste parental bliss,
Or soothe declining age.

Then share, come share with me my humble shed,
Amid my little sons be truly blest,
And heal with friendly balms,
Thy sufferings and thy toils.
