Gift of the gods, life's most endearing charm,
Friendship divine!  come!  penetrate the soul:
When lighted at thy flame, our bosoms warm
With pure delight &mdash; our days serenely roll;
Thy chains but bind to joys without control;
Time still improves thy loveliness &mdash; to bless;
Love leaves thee Constancy &mdash; to crown the whole;
And thou would'st be supreme voluptuousness
Did man &mdash; fallen, guilty, man &mdash; his innocence possess.
