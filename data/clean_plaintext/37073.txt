There is a friend who loves me still; &mdash; unchanged
By all the errors of my devious way,
When fickle fancies have my plans deranged
Or hurtful follies lured my steps astray,
Her tenderness remain'd: &mdash; nor would she grieve
The lonely trusting one, that in her shade did live.

Amid the wayward freaks of childish haste,&mdash;
Amid the wanderings of my youthful lot,
When toys deluded, or when phantoms chased,
Some sooth'd and promised, &mdash; then their care forgot;
But one hath loved me still:  the friend who sleeps
Where the long herbage sighs and where remembrance weeps.

When Friendship's alter'd brow withheld its smile,
When cold and stern, her cordial welcome fled;
Though like a pilgrim, fainting mid his toil,
Even in its pangs my struggling heart has said,
One friend there is, who loves me still, &mdash; above;&mdash;
The grave hath changed her form, but could not chill her love.

Reprove me not! &mdash; I trust she loves me still,
Though cold, and mute, and motionless her dust,
For when my heart hath felt affliction's thrill,
Or swoln to bursting, mourn'd its broken trust;
Soft on the breeze of heaven, a voice would sigh
"Despond not thus, my child, my spirit hovers nigh."&mdash;

And in the silence of the midnight trance,
In snowy robe she comes to cheer my sight;
So holy, so benignant is her glance,
Her brow so placid, &mdash; and her eye so bright,
I know she loves me still: &mdash; and oh! that thought
Shall strongly nerve my soul to do the things it ought.
