O Thou, the guardian of my orphan years,
That to the welcome tomb now guides my feet,
That led our fathers thro' this vale of tears,
Whose hearts no more with pious fervours beat.
O hear a parent's prayer, and bless my boy,
Pride of my hoary age, and all my earthly joy.

When wild-eyed pleasure darts th' illicit glance,
Where guileful guilt gay trims the treacherous snare,
When bounding joy weaves the tumultuous dance,
And vine crown'd vice breaths loud the brutal air,
O then the cherub Piety send down,
To fix faint Virtue firmly on her trembling throne.

In fickle youth he leaves my aged arms,
When head-strong passion fires the fervent blood,
O may he shun the wizard Vice's charm,
And rise in favour with the wise and good,
Attending angels wave the purple wing,
And waft the prayer all smiling to the eternal King.

The Great Supreme scorns not the tenderest sigh,
But every heartfelt prayer regardful hears,
Adversity on speediest pinion flies,
The kind behest in fearful form she bears,
And downward as she heaves her heavy flight,
A thousand terrors thicken thro' the shades of night.

Ah see the tender tribe of youthful sweets,
Flee frightened from their lawns and gamesome play,
And rosy joy, and mirth with frolick feats,
Ah see them by the fury scared away:
Her blasting train becloud the sunniest hours,
And o'er blythe health dark brooding discontentment low'rs.

Keen are the mocking frowns dependence bears,
Dash'd by the haughty hand of wealth aside;
Keener the blush that modest merit wears,
At the upbraiding boon of pitying pride;
Fickle suspense gives yet a deeper wound,
Chains the wide ranging mind, and drags it to the ground.

She joys in trackless deserts waste and wide,
Wherein no end nor object meet the eye,
Save shapeless fears that toss the fretful tide,
And ride the billows of anxiety.
Hung o'er the yawning gulph there wretches howl,
Above, loose rocks, beneath, the black waves deadly roll.
