Thus have I trac'd for that too favoring eye,
The wanderings of a soul which fain would find
Where in the end its weary wings might lie,
Far from the storms of this rude world reclin'd.
Though such a nest on earth it never find,
While that sweet voice can still forbear to blame,
While that soft breast can still continue kind,
Barr'd as I am from every tenderer claim,
All Joy shall not seem false, all Hope without an aim!
