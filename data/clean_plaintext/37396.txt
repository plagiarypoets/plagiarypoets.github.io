Again the gorgeous sun with giant force
Leads forth the fleeting hours that form the year,
And rushes onward in his flaming course
To that dread moment ending all things here.
This can I view regardless, void of fear,
Borne daily on his chariot wheels which roll
Down to the yawning grave in full career?
Oh!  let me ask, ere he has reach'd his goal,
Where shall thou find thy final home, my soul?

Ah!  where are they &mdash; who saw with me the sun,
When on the year departed, first he rose;
Young, vig'rous, beautiful, that year begun,
But sunk into the tomb before its close?
If righteous Heav'n should number me with those
On whom the new year's sun no more shall rise,
Must I from hence descend to endless woes,
Or upward soar to share the blisful prize,
Where the redeem'd shall reign, with Christ beyond the skies.

Has this world's emptiness so charm'd my heart,
That here, forever, I would fondly stay;
Lose heav'n itself for dreams which soon depart;
Eternal glory, for a house of clay;
For gross delusions of life's transient day!&mdash;
O, rather let my soul, awak'ning, scorn
Th' infernal snare; and flee to Christ, the Way,
The Life, the Light; of heav'nly day, the dawn;
In whom, exulting thought, to die is to be born!
