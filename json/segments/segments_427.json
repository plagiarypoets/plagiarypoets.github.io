["Celestial Muse, Instruct me how to sing</br>The generous Pity of the British King,</br>Who mov'd by Gallia's crys, and Heav'n's Command,</br>Sustain'd excessive toyl by Sea and Land,</br>The Gallic Christian's Freedom to restore,</br>And save Neustrasia's Realm from Clotar's power.", "The Valiant Briton from the Cimbrean Coast</br>Was newly landed with his Conq'ring Host,</br>Leading his Spoils and Captive Lords along</br>Augusta's Streets, amidst th' applauding throng,</br>Who sung his Triumphs and proclaim'd aloud</br>His mighty Deeds on Eyder's wond'ring Flood:</br>When num'rous Envoy's drawn by Arthur's fame,</br>From distant Kingdoms to Augusta came.</br>Faces so strange, and Habits so unknown,</br>Had ne'er before pass'd thro' th' admiring Town.</br>They made their publick Entrys at her Gate</br>With great Magnificence and Princely State.</br>They strove in Pomp each other to out-do,</br>And who should most their Master's Greatness shew.</br>Thick at the Court did Foreign Lords appear,</br>Some by Affection brought, but more by Fear.</br>Some Leagues of lasting Friendship offer'd, some</br>Did for Protection from Oppression come:</br>But all, O Albion, did applaud thy fate</br>Blest with so just a Prince to guide thy State.", "The Night her Sable Banner did display,</br>And from the Air to chase the Light away</br>Drew out her must'ring Shades in black Array:</br>When Britain's King dissolv'd in balmy rest</br>Dismist the Cares of Empire from his Breast.</br>But Heav'n mean time, which such a Noble Mind</br>For Dangers, and for glorious toyle design'd,</br>Did by a Dream sent in the silent Night,</br>To fresh Heroic Deeds the King excite:</br>Its Springs divinely touch'd, his lab'ring Brain</br>Did this Celestial Vision entertain.</br>"]
