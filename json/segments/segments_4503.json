["The virgin, when soften'd by May,</br>Attends to the villager's vows;</br>The birds sweetly bill on the spray,</br>And poplars embrace with their boughs;</br>On Ida bright Venus may reign,</br>Ador'd for her beauty above!</br>We shepherds that dwell on the plain,</br>Hail May as the mother of love.", "From the west as it wantonly blows</br>Fond zephyr caresses the vine:</br>The bee steals a kiss from the rose,</br>And willows and woodbines entwine;</br>The pinks by the rivulet side,</br>That border the vernal alcove,</br>Bend downward to kiss the soft tide;</br>For May is the mother of love.", "May tinges the butterfly's wing,</br>He flutters in bridal array!</br>And, if the wing'd foresters sing,</br>Their music is taught them by May.</br>The stock-dove, recluse with her mate,</br>Conceals her, fond bliss in the grove,</br>And murmuring seems to repent</br>That May is the mother of love!", "The goddess will visit ye soon,</br>Ye virgins be sportive and gay;</br>Get your pipes, oh ye shepherds, in tune,</br>For music must welcome the May.</br>Would Damon have Phillis prove kind,</br>And all his keen anguish remove,</br>Let him tell her soft tales, and he'll find</br>That May is the mother of love.</br>"]
