["Hail, goddess with the phrensied eye!  hail, Fear!</br>All hail, the terrors brought by thee!</br>Hail, all the horrid tales of thee we hear!</br>Hail, all the frightful sights we see!</br>Hail to thy train of ghosts and goblins dire,</br>Of ghostly sounds of wo, and screams of ire,</br>Which float, upborne on vivid Fancy's wings,</br>And pierce the inmost souls of clowns and kings!", "O'er man and beast thy pow'r is spread,</br>From thee nought human's free;</br>Brutes shun mankind, as things they dread,</br>And man from brutes doth flee:</br>Pale Guilt, with haggard look and mien,</br>Flies before thy phantom train</br>On hasty trembling wing;</br>For shadowy shapes and visions dire,</br>With all thy vengeful rout, conspire</br>To point dread Conscience' sting!", "The traveller, by thee possest,</br>As Night veils in her sable crest,</br>Feels tremblings strange and dread;</br>He calls to mind each well-known place,</br>Where wand'ring sprites are said to trace;</br>In fancy sees their figures glide,</br>In angry mood, close by his side;</br>Their forms he follows with his eyes,</br>Till all is lost; &mdash; and at each noise</br>He starts, and turns his head.", "Full oft by thee the rustic clown's o'erta'en,</br>When, as he speeds across the desert plain,</br>He spies, beneath some blasted yew,</br>By Cynthia's light, the elfin crew.</br>He pauses, &mdash; starts; &mdash; his eyeballs glare;</br>His mouth stretch'd wide, erect his hair;</br>Horror seizes on his brain!</br>His heart beats quick, &mdash; cold drops distil!</br>His trembling limbs refuse his will.</br>Parch'd is his mouth &mdash; fast clench'd his hands;</br>A perfect statue thus he stands,</br>And views the tiny train.", "I see the peasants, round their little fire,</br>In harmless converse pass the winter's eve;</br>Relating dismal tales of witch'ries dire,</br>Which ev'ry hearer firmly doth believe.</br>I see thee enter 'mid the train,</br>And straight infest each rustic's brain,</br>With all thy grisly crew;</br>Each eye is instant cast around,</br>The list'ners huddle closer round,</br>And hum, and nod, and ghastly stare,</br>Whilst stiff as bristles stands each hair,</br>Nor know they what they do.</br>Such, Fear, is thy all-pow'rful sway,</br>Which sceptered kings, and clowns, obey.</br>"]
