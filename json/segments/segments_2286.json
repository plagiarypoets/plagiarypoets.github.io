["Ye shepherds, and nymphs of the plain,</br>Come tripping about in a throng;</br>Since COLIN'S the theme of my strain,</br>You will all of you join in the song:</br>Of nymphs the delight and the joy;</br>Of shepherds the envy and praise;</br>There's none but must heave the soft sigh,</br>There's none but will echo the lays.", "With all that can charm and delight,</br>With all that can rapture inspire;</br>More dear to his PHOEBE than sight,</br>He is all my fond wishes desire:</br>He has found ev'ry charm that can please,</br>Sure Cupid has lent him his dart;</br>He has stol'n from the Graces their ease,</br>He has stol'n &mdash; No, &mdash; I gave him my heart.", "I ask not the splendour of courts,</br>I love not the noise of the town;</br>Ah!  far from such joyless resorts</br>The Graces affrighted are flown:</br>Vain pomp has no charms for my breast,</br>All state but my COLIN I scorn;</br>With him my poor cot would be blest,</br>Without him a palace forlorn.", "With him when I trip o'er the plain,</br>How swift glide the hours away!</br>But ah!  when he leaves me again,</br>How dull and how tedious the day!</br>When he speaks, how my heart does rejoice!</br>When he sings, how I'm charm'd with the song!</br>Sure music's more sweet from his voice,</br>And truth flows improv'd from his tongue!", "He has told me &mdash; I can't but believe,</br>That PHOEBE is dear to his breast;</br>He has said, and he cannot deceive,</br>&mdash;But why need I tell you the rest?</br>Ye shepherds, rejoice in his bliss,</br>Ye nymphs do not envy my joy:</br>Let your manners be artless as his,</br>And be happy as COLIN and I.</br>"]
