["Sitting one day beside a silver brook,</br>Whose sleepy waves unwillingly forsook</br>The strict embraces of the flow'ry shore,</br>As loath to leave what they should see no more:</br>I read (as fate had turn'd it to my hand)</br>Among the famous lays of fairy land,</br>Belphoebe's fond mistrust, whenas she met</br>Her gentle Squire with lovely Amoret.</br>And laying by the book, poor lad, quoth I,</br>Must all thy joys, like Eve's posterity,</br>Receive a doom, not to be chang'd by suit,</br>Only for tasting the forbidden fruit?</br>Had fair Belphoebe licens'd thee some time</br>To kiss her cherry lip, thou didst a crime;</br>But since she for thy thirst no help would bring,</br>Thou lawfully might'st seek another spring;</br>And had those kisses stol'n been melting sips,</br>Ta'en by consent from Amoret's sweet lips,</br>Thou might'st have answer'd, if thy love had spied,</br>How others gladly gave what she denied;</br>But since they were not such, it did approve</br>A jealousy not meriting thy love,</br>And an injustice offer'd by the maid</br>In giving judgment ere she heard thee plead.</br>I have a Love, (and then I thought of you</br>As Heaven can witness I each minute do,)</br>So well assur'd of that once promis'd faith,</br>Which my unmoved Love still cherisheth,</br>That should she see me private with a dame,</br>Fair as herself, and of a house whose name,</br>From Phoebus' rise to Tagus where he sets,</br>Hath been as famous as Plantagenet's;</br>Whose eyes would thaw congealed hearts of ice;</br>And as we now dispute of Paradise,</br>And question where fair Eden stood of old,</br>Among so many sweet plots we behold,</br>Which by the arms of those brave rivers been</br>Embraced which of yore did keep it in:</br>So were she one, who did so much abound</br>In graces, more than ever mortal crown'd,</br>That it might fitly for a question pass,</br>Where or wherein her most of beauty was.</br>I surely could believe, nay, I durst swear,</br>That your sweet goodness would not stoop to fear,</br>Though she might be to any that should win it</br>A Paradise without a serpent in it.", "Such were my thoughts of you, and thinking so,</br>Much like a man, who running in the snow</br>From the surprisal of a murd'rous elf,</br>Beats out a path, and so betrays himself,</br>I in security was further gone,</br>And made a path for your suspicion</br>To find me out.  Time being nigh the same,</br>When thus I thought, and when your letters came.", "But, oh, how far I err'd, how much deceiv'd</br>Was my belief!  yourself, that have bereav'd</br>Me of that confidence, my love had got,</br>Judge if I were an infidel or not;</br>And let me tell you, fair, the fault was thine,</br>If I did misbelieve, and none of mine.", "That man which sees, as he along doth pass</br>Some beaten way, a piece of sparkling glass,</br>And deems far off that it a diamond is,</br>Adds to the glass by such a thought of his:</br>But when he finds it wants, to quit his pain,</br>The value soon returns to him again.", "If in the ruder North some country clown,</br>That stands to see the king ride through the town,</br>Spying some gay and gold-belaced thing,</br>Should cry, See, neighbours, yonder comes the king:</br>And much mistaken both in state and age,</br>Points at some lord, and for a lord a page:</br>Is not that lord or page beholding much</br>To him that thinks them worthy to be such</br>He took them for?  And are not you to me</br>Indebted much, since my credulity</br>Made you the same I thought you, and from thence</br>Rais'd an assurance of your confidence?</br>These were the thoughts of you I still was in,</br>Nor shall your letters so much of me win;</br>I will not trust mine eyes so much to think</br>Your white hand wrote with such a staining ink;</br>Or if I ever take it for your hand,</br>I sure shall think I do not understand</br>In reading as you meant, and fall from thence</br>To doubt if points perverted not the sense!</br>For such a constant faith I have in thee,</br>That I could die even in that heresy.", "In this belief of you I stand as yet,</br>And think as those that follow Mahomet:</br>He merits much that doth continue still</br>In his first faith, although that faith be ill.", "A vain inconstant dame, that counts her loves</br>By this enamell'd ring, that pair of gloves,</br>And with her chamber-maid when closely set,</br>Turning her letters in her cabinet,</br>Makes known what tokens have been sent unto her,</br>What man did bluntly, who did courtly woo her;</br>Who hath the best face, neatest leg, most lands,</br>Who for his carriage in her favour stands.</br>Op'ning a paper then she shows her wit</br>On an epistle that some fool had writ:</br>Then meeting with another which she likes,</br>Her chambermaid's great reading quickly strikes</br>That good opinion dead, and swears that this</br>Was stol'n from Palmerin or Amadis.</br>Next come her sonnets, which they spelling read,</br>And say the man was very much afraid</br>To have his meaning known, since they from thence</br>(Save Cupid's darts) can pick no jot of sense;</br>And in conclusion, with discretion small,</br>Scoff this, scorn that, and so abuse them all.</br>If I had thought you such an empty prize,</br>I had not sought now to apologize,</br>Nor had these lines the virgin paper stain'd</br>But, as my Love, unspotted had remain'd;</br>And sure I think to what I am about</br>My ink than it was wont goes slower out,</br>As if it told me I but vaguely writ</br>To her that should, but will not, credit it.", "Yet go, ye hopeless lines, and tell that fair,</br>Whose flaxen tresses with the wanton air</br>Entrap the darling boy, that daily flies</br>To see his sweet face in her sweeter eyes;</br>Tell my Fidelia, if she do aver</br>That I with borrow'd phrases courted her,</br>Or sung to her the lays of other men;</br>And like the cag'd thrush of a citizen,</br>Tir'd with a note continually sung o'er</br>The ears of one that knew that all before.</br>If thus she think, (as I shall ne'er be won</br>Once to imagine she hath truly done,)</br>Let her then know, though now a many be</br>Parrots, which speak the tongue of Arcadie,</br>Yet in themselves not so much language know,</br>Nor wit sufficient for a Lord Mayor's show.</br>I never yet but scorn'd a taste to bring</br>Out of the channel when I saw the spring,</br>Or like a silent organ been so weak,</br>That others' fingers taught me how to speak.</br>The sacred Nine, whose powerful songs have made</br>In wayless deserts trees of mighty shade</br>To bend in admiration, and allay'd</br>The wrath of tigers with the notes they play'd,</br>Were kind in some small measure at my birth,</br>And by the hand of Nature to my earth</br>Lent their eternal heat, by whose bright flame</br>Succeeding time shall read and know your name,</br>And pine in envy of your praises writ,</br>Though now your brightness strive to lessen it.</br>Thus have I done, and like an artist spent</br>My days to build another's monument;</br>Yet you those pains so careless overslip,</br>That I am not allow'd the workmanship.</br>Some have done less, and have been more rewarded;</br>None hath lov'd more, and hath been less regarded:</br>Yet the poor silkenworm and only I</br>Like parallels run on to work and die.</br>Why write I then again, since she will think</br>My heart is limned with another's ink?</br>Or if she deem these lines had birth from me,</br>Perhaps will think they but deceivers be,</br>And, as our flattering painters do impart,</br>A fair made copy of a faithless heart,</br>O, my Fidelia, if thou canst be won</br>From that mistrust my absence hath begun,</br>Be now converted, kill those jealous fears,</br>Credit my lines:  if not, believe my tears,</br>Which with each word, nay, every letter, strove</br>That in their number you might read my love.</br>And where (for one distracted needs must miss)</br>My language not enough persuasive is,</br>Be that supplied with what each eye affords,</br>For tears have often had the power of words.</br>Grant this, fair saint, since their distilling rain</br>Permits me not to read it o'er again.</br>For as a swan more white than Alpine snow,</br>Wand'ring upon the sands of silver Po,</br>Hath his impression by a fuller sea</br>Not made so soon as quickly wash'd away:</br>Such in my writing now the state hath been,</br>For scarce my pen goes of the ink yet green,</br>But floods of tears fall on it in such store,</br>That I perceive not what I writ before</br>Can any man do thus, yet that man be</br>Without the fire of love and loyalty?</br>Know then in breach of Nature's constant laws,</br>There may be an effect and yet no cause.</br>Without the sun we may have April showers,</br>And wanting moisture know no flowers;</br>Causeless the elements could cease to war:</br>The seaman's needle to the Northern star</br>Without the loadstone would for ever move.</br>If all these tears can be and yet no love:</br>If you still deem I only am the man,</br>Which in the maze of love yet never ran:</br>Or if in love I surely did pursue</br>The favour of some other, not of you;</br>Or loving you, would not be strictly tied</br>To you alone, but sought a saint beside:</br>Know then by all the virtues we enthrone,</br>That I have lov'd, lov'd you, and you alone.</br>Read o'er my lines where truthful passion mov'd,</br>And Hate itself will say that I have lov'd.</br>Think on my vows which have been ever true,</br>And know by them that I affected you.</br>Recount my trials, and they will impart</br>That none is partner with you in my heart.</br>Lines, vows, and trials will conclude in one,</br>That I have lov'd, lov'd you, and you alone.</br>Lines, seek no more then to that doubtful fair,</br>And ye, my vows, for evermore forbear:</br>Trials to her prove never true again;</br>Since lines, vows, trials strive all but in vain.</br>Yet when I writ, the ready tongue of Truth</br>Did ever dictate, not deceiving youth.</br>When I have sworn my tongue did never err</br>To be my heart's most true interpreter,</br>And proof confirm'd when you examin'd both,</br>Love caused those lines, and constancy that oath;</br>And shall I write, protest (you prove) and then</br>Be left the most unfortunate of men?</br>Must truth be still neglected?  faith forgot?</br>And constancy esteem'd as what is not?</br>Shall dear regard and love for ever be</br>Wrong'd with the name of lust and flattery?</br>It must, for this your last suspicion tells,</br>That you intend to work no miracles.</br>"]
