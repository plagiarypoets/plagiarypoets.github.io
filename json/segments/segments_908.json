["Blest pow'r whom heav'nly wisdom chose,</br>Guardian of Britain's favour'd shore,</br>When first above the flood she rose</br>Amidst applauding ocean's roar,</br>Say, hast thou, thro' the length of days,</br>In antient fame, or recent praise;</br>Hast thou a dawn of glory known,</br>Like that whose lustre gilds thy George's throne?", "Yet ne'er estrang'd from virtue's lore</br>Was Albion's gen'rous offspring found;</br>For deeds they wrought, for toils they bore,</br>Her sons were honour'd, fear'd, renown'd;</br>Then, when beneath each hallow'd oak,</br>Some hoary Druid sat and spoke;</br>Or all inspir'd, in uncouth song,</br>Urg'd the rough truth that charm'd the manly throng.", "Improv'd, as age succeeding age,</br>In varied excellence they shone;</br>While holy faith subdu'd their rage,</br>And added virtues all its own:</br>Repuls'd the bold invader fled;</br>The vaunting Gaul in triumph led,</br>Still serv'd a mightier arm to show,</br>And grace the conquests of a stronger foe.", "Nor stood they last in learning's train,</br>In works of skill and arts of peace;</br>Far spread their fleets o'er all the main,</br>Fraught with the circling world's increase.</br>They turn'd to things on earth, on high,</br>Nor turn'd in vain the curious eye;</br>They felt the genuine heav'n-born ray</br>That fires the soul, and prompts the living lay.", "Yet never could the British race,</br>The summits of their glory gain;</br>Tho' Cressy's field their annals grace;</br>Tho' loud they boast Eliza's reign:</br>Now, now to wreaths before unsought,</br>Intent they stretch the glowing thought;</br>And, while they hail the Prince's name,</br>Prophetic trace the fulness of their fame.", "O!  bid, lov'd Prince!  their purpose live,</br>Their purpose honest zeal inspires;</br>Cherish the hopes thy virtues give,</br>'Till each improves as he admires;</br>'Till all thy fair example own,</br>And catch new spirit from the throne;</br>To more exalted rapture rise,</br>And meet bright glory's blaze with hardier eyes.", "The nobler heart, the bolder hand,</br>Shall then to thee new trophies raise,</br>And ev'ry palm that decks thy land,</br>Conspire to sanctify thy praise:</br>Each happier art, each great design,</br>With ardor emulous of thine,</br>Beyond the former bounds shall stray,</br>And follow as thy virtues lead the way.</br>"]
