["Think not, my Friend, I trivial deem</br>The meed of high renown;</br>Or muse with light regard on them,</br>For whom th' ennobling hand of fame</br>Hath wove of Delphic bays an ever-verdant crown.", "On a tall mountain's craggy height</br>Fame's tow'ring portals shine;</br>There to my visionary sight</br>High bards, array'd in robes of light,</br>Their laurell'd temples wave, and gird the golden shrine.", "There, Avon stream, thy Muse of fire,</br>And, Mulla, thine is there;</br>And he, who wak'd th' Aeolian lyre;</br>And he, who durst from earth aspire</br>Into the heav'n of heav'ns, and draw empyreal air.", "Fir'd by the sight, with zeal I glow</br>To spurn the grov'ling throng;</br>Upward on eagle wings to go,</br>To seat me mid the high-soul'd few,</br>And smite the golden chord, and swell the echoing song.", "But not to me the soul divine,</br>And sounding voice are given;</br>Nor mine with plastic hand to join</br>In one harmonious grand design</br>Wild Fancy's forms and paint with colours dipt in heaven.", "While Oxford then with eager voice</br>Thy bright career pursues;</br>Be mine, my Friend, th' inglorious choice</br>In lowly valleys to rejoice,</br>And meditate the calm but not ungrateful Muse.", "Be mine the less ambitious care,</br>Nor vain that care shall prove,</br>To win fond friendship's partial ear,</br>And in the lonely hour to cheer</br>With many a simple strain the heart of her I love.</br>"]
