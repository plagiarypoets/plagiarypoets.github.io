["Happy the wight, who, free from all the cares</br>Of busy life, with sweet contentment blest,</br>Enjoys a lonely garret's cool retreat.</br>The rattling coach, and envious bustling croud,</br>Whom harder fate compels to trudge along,</br>Disturb him not, nor ever discompose</br>His peace, and calm serenity of mind.</br>What tho' no gilded mirror's ample range,</br>Reflecting all his wants, salutes his view</br>At entering, nor the costly Parian stone,</br>With polish'd gloss, adorns his humble hearth,</br>Which seldom brightens with the genial blaze?</br>What tho' he boast no gobelin tapestry,</br>Nor gorgeous arras hangings, but is forc'd</br>To form an anti-chamber with a wall</br>Of wretched canvas, full of horrid chasms?</br>What tho' the wintry storm, in all its rage,</br>Beats on his roof with howling blast, and makes</br>His tottering mansion quake thro' every beam?</br>What tho', returning homeward late at eve,</br>Fatigu'd with all the labours of the day,</br>Sighing for sweet repose, he be inforc'd,</br>'Ere he attain his nest's aerial height,</br>Up the ascent of sixty tedious steps,</br>Arrang'd in scalar, or in spiral form,</br>To drag his stiffen'd, spent, and restive limbs?</br>Yet, in his cloudy tabernacle shrin'd</br>(Like godlike Socrates in hamper hung),</br>He sees the busy world, beneath his feet,</br>Rustling incessant:  he himself mean-while,</br>From the vain ways of erring mortal men</br>Sequester'd, views them all:  nor recks whate'er,</br>Cit, beau, or bunter in pav'd street beside.", "O who will set me on the yielding floor,</br>Shelt'ring my head beneath the nodding roof</br>Of some waste garret twenty story high!</br>To garrets oft, if we may credit fame,</br>The tuneful nine have whilome made resort;</br>In garrets still their frequent voice is heard,</br>On garret-walls their rarest strains are chalk'd;</br>And when from earth, retreating late, they soar</br>Up to their native sky, and leave mankind</br>In slumberous stupidity immers'd,</br>To lofty garrets last they'll bid adieu.", "Who love not garrets, be he doom'd to dwell</br>Deep sunk below the level of the ground,</br>In some capacious cell, far from the paths</br>Of the bright sun and circling year remov'd!</br>While to the garret-swain, the signs of heav'n,</br>And all its wonders stand confess'd to view.</br>He first, with joyful gratulation, hails</br>The dawning day, and last of all enjoys</br>Its parting rays, from that exalted post,</br>Where, perch'd sublime, he roosts among the stars.</br>"]
