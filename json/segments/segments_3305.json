["Why blooms the radiance of the morning sky?</br>Why springs the beauties of the season round?</br>Why buds the blossom with the glossy die?</br>Ah!  why does nature beautify the ground?", "Whilst softly floating on the Zephyr's wing,</br>The melting accents of the thrushes rise:</br>And all the heav'nly music of the spring,</br>Steal on the sense, and harmonize the skies.", "When the rack'd soul is not attun'd to joy,</br>When sorrow an internal monarch reigns:</br>In vain the choiristers their powers employ,</br>'Tis hateful music, and discordant strains.", "The velvet mantle of the skirted mead,</br>The rich varieties of Flora's pride,</br>Till the full bosom is from trouble freed,</br>Disgusts the eye, and bids the big tear glide.", "Once, 'ere the gold-hair'd sun shot the new ray,</br>Through the grey twilight of the dubious morn,</br>To woodlands, lawns, and hills I took my way,</br>And listen'd to the echoes of the horn;", "Dwelt on the prospect, sought the varied view,</br>Trac'd the meanders of the bubbling stream,</br>From joy to joy, uninterrupted flew,</br>And thought existence but a fairy dream.", "Now thro' the gloomy cloister's length'ning way,</br>Thro' all the terror superstition frames,</br>I lose the minutes of the ling'ring day,</br>And view the night light up her pointed flames.", "I dare the danger of the mould'ring wall,</br>Nor heed the arch that totters o'er my head:</br>O!  quickly may the friendly ruin fall,</br>Release me of my love, and strike me dead.", "M***!  cruel, sweet, inexorable fair,</br>O!  must I unregarded seek the grave!</br>Must I from all my bosom holds, repair,</br>When one indulgent smile from thee, would save.", "Let mercy plead my cause; and think!  O think!</br>A love like mine but ill deserves thy hate:</br>Remember, I am tott'ring on the brink,</br>Thy smile or censure seals my final fate.</br>"]
