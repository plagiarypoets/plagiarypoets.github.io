["Father of old oblivion, hail!</br>Restrain thy swift-revolving glass;</br>If soothing verse can ought avail,</br>To charm thy moments as they pass.</br>Still shall I let thee onward glide,</br>To waft me down thy boundless tide,</br>And unimprov'd remain my soul,</br>When twenty-one quick summers from me thou hast stole?", "Adieu!  amusements of my youth,</br>My childhood and my boyish days!</br>For virtue, probity, and truth,</br>I quit my sports and frolic lays!</br>Yet will remembrance bring to view,</br>The years, in playful bliss, that flew,</br>When careless of the passing hours,</br>My whistle sweet I blew, or cull'd the muse's flow'rs!", "Then oft in Schuylkill's silver wave,</br>Or Delaware's majestic tide,</br>My limbs, delighted, would I lave,</br>Or thro' the foamy billow's glide;</br>Then chase the plover o'er the brake,</br>Or treach'ry cast along the lake,</br>Pleas'd to delude the finny fry,</br>The perch with glittering scales, or trout of golden dye.", "Oft too, as Sol's resplendent ray</br>With ardour beam'd thro' Cancer's sign,</br>Would I the river's margent stray,</br>Or on its velvet brink recline.</br>Then would Fancy ope her treasures,</br>Pouring on the mind new pleasures,</br>Unlocking all her fairy scenes</br>Of gay enamell'd groves and sweet Elysian greens.", "How would she then uncurtain fate,</br>And snatch the soul to yonder sky,</br>Events unknown to man create,</br>And read conceal'd futurity?</br>Or, ages old revolving o'er,</br>Their worthies place my eyes before;</br>Hero or patriot, saint or sage,</br>Or who e'er smote the lyre with bold poetic rage.", "Flush'd with these glowing visions bright,</br>What noble frenzy seiz'd the soul!</br>Each phantom then of dear delight</br>Would round the impassion'd eye-balls roll;</br>Then o'er my temples oft the muse</br>Vouchsaf'd to shed nectareous dews;</br>How would I eye her ivy crown,</br>And pant, in youthful heat, for deathless fair renown?", "But hence, ye dear delusions all,</br>'Tis time I tear you from my breast;</br>Methinks!  I hear sweet Reason call,</br>\"Be not with empty dreams possest!\"</br>Away, ye pleasing shades away,</br>I brook no longer fond delay&mdash;</br>Reluctant still ye from me fly,</br>Your airy forms I see yet flit before my eye!", "But come, thou habitant of heav'n!</br>Inspirer of each gallant deed;</br>Virtue, bright queen, to whom 'tis given</br>The soul for purer joys to breed;</br>High-arch'd, o'er yon cerulean plain,</br>Sublimely shines thy sacred fane,</br>The graces wait its portals nigh,</br>Which perfect shall endure thro' vast eternity.", "Come, and thy gracious aid impart,</br>Each perishing pursuit to tame;</br>O root out folly from my heart,</br>And thou the full possession claim.</br>Each roving wish, each vain desire,</br>O purge with thy celestial fire;</br>What is the world's, the people's gaze?</br>Hence with the bubble fame, and idle breath of praise!", "Whether, adown the stream of time,</br>I pass with easy prosp'rous sails;</br>Or o'er its waves I painful climb,</br>Forlorn and toss'd by stormy gales;</br>Still let me check the wanton breeze,</br>Nor be absorb'd in slothful ease;</br>But stedfast steer, when tempests rise</br>That rend my shatter'd bark, or mount it to the skies.", "So come what will, the adverse scene,</br>Or fortune's gay alluring smile,</br>Still shall I keep my soul serene,</br>Superior to all sinful guile;</br>Then, whether Fate's resistless shears,</br>Shall clip my thread in ripen'd years;</br>Or, in my Prime, my doom be spoke,</br>Undaunted shall I yield, and fearless meet the stroke.</br>"]
