["Ye shepherds who sport on the plains,</br>Blythe, innocent, chearful and gay,</br>O listen a while to my strains,</br>And weep for a moment with me!", "My Daphne was lovely and young,</br>More chaste and than the queen of the grove,</br>Wit flow'd like a stream from her tongue</br>Her charms fill'd my bosom with love.", "And while she my passion repaid,</br>I lov'd the dear charmer sincere,</br>To please her all arts I essay'd,</br>On earth she was all I held dear.", "When with her in summer I stray'd,</br>How quickly the minutes flew by!</br>And when we reclin'd in the shade,</br>How chearful &mdash; how happy was I!", "How happy oftimes have I been,</br>When my head on her breast I reclin'd:</br>She never affected disdain,</br>But smil'd and was modestly kind.", "But, ah!  how unhappy a swain</br>Am I!  since she's broke ev'ry vow;</br>What anguish &mdash; what torturing pain,</br>I for her dear sake undergo!", "At midnight when all are asleep,</br>And eas'd from their labours and cares,</br>Alone without ceasing I weep,</br>And drench my sad bosom with tears.", "And when the bright sun in the east,</br>In golden apparel appears,</br>Still &mdash; still I'm with sorrows opprest,</br>And still I'm bedew'd with my tears!", "My days of delight are no more!</br>No all hope of comfort is gone!</br>Forsaken I'm left to deplore!</br>She's wedded, and I am undone!</br>"]
