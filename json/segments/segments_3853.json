["As when the demon of the summer storm</br>Walks forth, the noon-tide landscape to deform;</br>Dark grows the vale, and dark the distant grove,</br>And thick the bolts of angry Jove</br>Athwart the wat'ry welkin glide,</br>And streams th' aerial torrent far and wide:</br>If by short fits the struggling day</br>Should dart a momentary ray,</br>Th' illumin'd mountain gleams awhile;</br>By faint degrees the radiant glance</br>Purple th' horizon's pale expanse,</br>And gilds the gloom with hasty smile:</br>Ah!  fickle smile, too swiftly past!</br>Again returns the driving blast:</br>With rage renew'd the tempest howls,</br>Again the blackening concave scowls;&mdash;</br>Sudden, the shades of the meridian night</br>Yield to the triumph of rekindling light:</br>The reddening sun regains his golden sway,</br>And Nature stands reveal'd in all her bright array.</br>"]
