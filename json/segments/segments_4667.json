["Thy voice hath sank to silence &mdash; it hath pass'd</br>Even as a dream-hour!  but the tones thou'st flung</br>Around still sink and swell upon the blast&mdash;</br>Hark!  hear'st thou not the rigid critic's tongue</br>Declare thou hast been impotently strung?</br>Yea, I too feel I have but weakly striven</br>To rise from earth; but to the eagle's young,</br>In its first trembling flutter, is it given</br>To cleave the clouds and dare the fiery orb of heaven?", "Has earth now an Alcmena's son, to crush,</br>Even in the cradle of his infant sleep,</br>The circling serpents, &mdash; in the silent hush</br>Of nameless haunts do not the streamlets creep,</br>'Ere, strong as death, they rock the thundering steep?</br>When morn comes upward from the mighty sea,</br>No beam of gladness gilds the billow's leap,</br>'Till more mature his reign of glory be&mdash;</br>Thus is it now, and thus it yet may be with thee!", "Yet if not so, enough remains for me</br>To sit once more my leafy homes among,</br>To hold companionship with only thee,</br>And give my days to solitude and song!</br>And be the critic's censure weak or strong,</br>This is thy solace &mdash; thou hast wak'd no strain</br>Which Virtue may condemn!  Dost thou not long</br>For that which dwells not in the paths of men&mdash;</br>The voice of peace? &mdash; go, seek thy home of hills again!</br>"]
