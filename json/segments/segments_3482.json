["Ah!  what avails, how once appear'd the Fair,</br>When from gay Equipage she falls obscure;</br>In vain she moves her livid Lips in Pray'r;</br>What Man so mean to recollect the Poor?", "From Place to Place, by unfee'd Bailiffs drove,</br>As fainting Fawns from thirsty Blood-hounds fly;</br>See the sad Remnants of unhallow'd Love,</br>In Prisons perish, or on Dunghills die.", "Pimps and Dependants once her Beauties prais'd;</br>And on these Beauties, Vermin-like, they fed;</br>From Wretchedness, the Crew her Bounty rais'd,</br>When by her Spoils enrich'd &mdash; deny her Bread.", "Through Street to Street, she wends, as Want betides,</br>Like Shore's sad Wife, in Winter's dismal Hours;</br>The bleak Winds piercing her unnourish'd Sides,</br>Her houseless Head dripping with drizzly Showers.", "Sickly she stroles amidst the miry Lane,</br>While streaming Spouts dash on her uncloath'd Neck;</br>By Famine pinch'd; pinch'd by Disease-bred Pain,</br>Contrition's Portrait, and rash Beauty's Wreck.", "She dies; sad Outcast!  Heart broke by Remorse;</br>Pale stretch'd against th' inhospitable Doors;</br>While gathering Gossips taunt the fleshless Corse,</br>And thank their Gods &mdash; that they were never Whores.</br>"]
