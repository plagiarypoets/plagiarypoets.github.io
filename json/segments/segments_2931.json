["DAMON.</br>When Phillis was faithful and fond &mdash; as she's fair,</br>A wreath of young roses incircled her hair!</br>But the willow, sad shepherd, must shadow thy brows,</br>For Phillis no longer remembers her vows;</br>To the groves, with fond Colin, the shepherdess flies,</br>While Damon disturbs the still plains with his sighs.", "PHILLIS.</br>Bethink thee, false Damon, before you upbraid;</br>When Phoebe's young lambkin had yesterday stray'd,</br>To the woodlands you wander'd, (poor Phillis forgot)</br>And drove the gay rambler quite home to her cot;</br>But a swain so deceitful no damsel can prize!</br>'Tis Phoebe &mdash; not Phillis &mdash; lays claim to your sighs.", "DAMON.</br>Like summer's gay season, young Phoebe is kind,</br>And her manners are graceful &mdash; untainted her mind!</br>Though the sweets of contentment her cottage adorn,</br>Though she's fresh as the rose-bud &mdash; and fair as the morn,&mdash;</br>Though she smiles like Pomona &mdash; these smiles I'd resign,</br>If Phillis were faithful, and deign'd to be mine.", "PHILLIS.</br>On his pipe though young Colin so prettily plays,</br>Though he sings such sweet sonnets, and writes in my praise;</br>Though he chose me his truelove last Valentine's day,</br>When birds sat like bridegrooms all pair'd on the spray;</br>I could drive the gay shepherd far, far from my mind,</br>If Damon, the rover, were constant and kind.", "DAMON.</br>Fine folk, my sweet Phillis, may revel and range,</br>But how fleeting the transport that's founded on change!</br>In the villager's cottage such happiness springs,</br>That peasants with pity may look down on Kings!</br>To the church then let's hasten, our transports to bind,</br>And Damon will always prove constant and kind.", "PHILLIS.</br>To the church then let's hasten, our transports to bind,</br>And Phillis will always prove constant and kind.</br>"]
