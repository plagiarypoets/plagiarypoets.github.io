["O peace to yonder tumult rude</br>That bursts upon my solitude!</br>And mingles with the storm afar,</br>The frantic ravings of despair,</br>While thro' the dreary deep of air,</br>Thy fatal voice is heard, O blood-stain'd war!</br>Yes, now the Passions wildly rage,</br>And sadly gloom the human scene;</br>Forgotten all the poet's page,</br>His pensive joys, and hour serene.</br>O hence, ye fury passions, hence!</br>But welcome to my longing arms,</br>Array'd in all thy sober charms,</br>Mild tranquil Indolence!</br>For much I love to view thy melting eye,</br>Thy wanton tresses careless fly,</br>The zoneless breast, the open grace,</br>The vagrant undetermin'd pace,</br>The aspect bland, the form benign,</br>The winning air, and smile divine.", "Amid the silent noon of night,</br>When sailing on in lustre bright,</br>O'er pathless wilds, and mountains drear,</br>The pale moon throws her silver ray,</br>Guiding the Pilgrim's lonely way,</br>To where the convent's distant spires appear;</br>O then thou lov'st, at ease reclin'd,</br>With contemplation by thy side,</br>Where gently steals the whisp'ring wind,</br>And soft the ling'ring waters glide,</br>To think, alas!  how short, how vain,</br>The rich man's boast, the poor man's woe!</br>What madness to exult below,</br>What folly to complain!</br>See hope's gay altars by fresh vot'ries drest,</br>The swarm of yesterday at rest,</br>Those budding flow'rs their seasons gave,</br>Have prov'd the blossoms of the grave,</br>And death alike shall soon efface,</br>The glories of the present race.", "O Goddess!  wave thy lily hand,</br>That meekly bears the magic wand,</br>To soothe the mental storm to rest;</br>And now life's drops unruffled flow,</br>Nor burn with rage, nor chill with woe;</br>But all is sweet, and tranquil, in the breast;</br>Nought now the placid soul can move,</br>Save Pity comes with tear-ful eye,</br>Or the fixt gaze the feeling Love,</br>Or gentle Mercy's heart-felt sigh:</br>Yet these will not disturb thy cell,</br>For Echo's dirge-like notes, and clear,</br>Shall oft inform thy list'ning ear,</br>With these the virtues dwell.</br>And see the fleecy clouds transparent fly,</br>Leaving serene the summer's sky,</br>And see gray Evening's gloom appears,</br>While Nature melts in dewy tears</br>O hither come, and bring with thee,</br>The rural nymph, Simplicity.", "Where Arno's waves uncertain flow,</br>Where rapid rolls the brighter Po,</br>Oft have I woo'd thee, Goddess dear!</br>To bless with ease my future days,</br>From censure far, or noisy praise:</br>O may thy clarion Fame!  sublime to hear,</br>Be ever to my senses mute;</br>'Tis true the thrilling notes are strong,</br>Yet cannot charm like Pity's lute,</br>Nor Philomela's plaintive song.</br>Beneath his courser's boundings fleet,</br>The laurel'd Hero as he goes,</br>Temples unseen full many a rose,</br>Nor heeds the perfume sweet.</br>But thou, indulgent Pow'r!  canst point the way,</br>Where all the milder pleasures stray,</br>The upland lawns, the shad'wy vales,</br>Cool lucid streams, and tepid gales,</br>And where the feather'd choir around,</br>Wanton amid the wilds of sound.", "Each haughty tyrant scorns to tread</br>Thy simple path, with flow'rs bespread;</br>He too, whose sordid soul requires</br>Still to encrease his daily heap,</br>Who leaves th' unfriended race to weep,</br>Base, wretched victim to his own desires,</br>Alas!  his bosom ne'er shall feel,</br>The bliss thy radiant smiles bestow,</br>When soft thy 'luring slumbers steal,</br>And charm away the sense of woe:</br>But bright Content shall thee be near,</br>And oft, to catch the breeze, unfold</br>Her waving locks of downy gold,</br>And chase the rising tear.</br>There glowing Genius shall in rapture muse,</br>And round his holy rays diffuse,</br>With comprehensive thought shall scan,</br>The windings in the maze of Man,</br>And thus with thee my limbs reclin'd,</br>Far from the world shall soar my mind.</br>"]
