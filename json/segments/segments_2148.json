["As over Falkirk's blood-stain'd field</br>Anglia, imperial goddess, flew,</br>With lifted spear, and radiant shield,</br>Conspicuous blazing to the view;</br>Her visage, lately clouded with despair,</br>Now reassum'd its first majestic air.", "Such seen, as oft, in battle warm,</br>She glow'd thro' many a martial age;</br>Or mild to breathe the civil charm,</br>With pious plans, and counsel sage:</br>For o'er the mingling glories of her face,</br>A manly greatness heightened female grace.", "Loud as the trumpet rolls its sound,</br>Her voice the powers celestial rais'd;</br>While her victorious sons around,</br>With silent joy and wonder gaz'd.</br>The sacred muses heard th' immortal lay,</br>And thus to earth the notes of fame convey.", "'Tis done, my sons, 'tis nobly done!</br>How vain th' efforts of rebel pow'r?</br>How faint their short-liv'd glory shone,</br>Born and extinguish'd in an hour?</br>Proudly they meditated slavish reigns;</br>One glorious moment came, and burst their chains.", "But late, forlorn, dejected, pale,</br>A prey to each insulting foe,</br>I sought the grove and gloomy vale,</br>To vent in solitude my woe:</br>Now, to my hand, the balance fair restor'd,</br>I wield again on high the imperial sword.", "What arm has this deliverance wrought?</br>'Tis he, the gallant youth, appears;</br>O!  warm in fields, and cool in thought,</br>Beyond the slow advance of years.</br>Haste, let me, rescu'd now from future harms,</br>Strain fast the filial virtue in my arms.", "I early nurs'd this royal youth,</br>The future guardian of these shores;</br>I fill'd his sacred breast with truth,</br>With fortitude, and wisdom's stores.</br>For when a noble action is decreed,</br>Heav'n forms the hero for the destin'd deed.", "Nor could the soft seducing charms</br>Of luxury, sure bane of youth,</br>E'er quench his generous thirst of arms,</br>Of honour, fame, of virtue, truth;</br>Fill'd with the warmth a country's love imparts,</br>He fled all pleasures, and admir'd all arts.", "He came, he spoke, and all around,</br>As quick as heav'n's swift darted flame,</br>Shepherds turn'd warriors at the sound,</br>And every bosom beat for fame:</br>They caught th' heroic ardour from his eyes,</br>And at his side the willing heroes rise.", "Rouse, Scotland, rouse, fame's warlike son,</br>In all thy ancient splendor shine;</br>Compleat the noble work begun,</br>And half the glory shall be thine.</br>I lend a prince (for such is heaven's decree)</br>Whose arm o'ercomes for George and liberty.</br>"]
