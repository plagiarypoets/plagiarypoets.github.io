["Hence restless dissipation,</br>Of busy Travel, and still changeful time!</br>Ills of each varied clime,</br>Dull sleepless nights, and hardship, and vexation!</br>The want of friendship's smiles,</br>And dread of sickness in a foreign land,</br>The frequent murth'rous band</br>That haunt the lonely pass mid forests drear,</br>The welcome insincere,</br>The solitary meal, and flatt'ring stranger's wiles.</br>But come Retirement to my arms</br>In meek simplicity of charms!</br>With close-wrapt robe of plainest dye,</br>And breast untroubled by a sigh,</br>Thee, blue-ey'd Peace in days of yore</br>To wrinckled, rough Experience, bore:</br>For once beneath her olive shade,</br>He fondly press'd the yielding maid,</br>Thy birth his secret transports prov'd,</br>Child of his age and best belov'd!", "O bear me quick to Albion's isle;</br>And cheer me with thy placid smile.</br>There let me oft at dewy dawn,</br>Compos'dly tread the russet lawn.</br>As my tranquil cot I see,</br>Embosom'd deep in many a tree;</br>Near it glides a winding spring,</br>Where the gray duck wets her wing,</br>And matron hen with infant brood,</br>Clucks beside the shallow flood</br>Or when lily-bosom'd May,</br>Trips along in youthful play,</br>With my rod, and mimic fly,</br>To lure the speckled trout I try,</br>That lurks beneath the sandy bank,</br>With sedge o'er-grown, and rushes dank,</br>Tempted by the faithless snare,</br>He leaps, and meets destruction there:</br>So alas!  in life we find,</br>Artful tricks to catch mankind,</br>So we view the gilded bait,</br>And rush upon severest fate.", "Varied bliss each season yields,</br>One while, wand'ring o'er the fields,</br>I see blithe groups collect the hay,</br>And shake it in the burning ray,</br>While the cattle in the brook,</br>Lash their tails with pensive look,</br>And mid the limpid waves assuage</br>The sultry Summer's scorching rage.</br>Or when Harvest-time is past,</br>And the barns  are fill'd at last,</br>With my Gun at peep of day,</br>To fallow, lands I take my way,</br>There my pointer soon descries,</br>The num'rous covey ere it flies.</br>As it mounts I take my aim,</br>And pleas'd behold the falling game.</br>Or I bring my greyhounds where</br>Nimbly starts the scudding hare,</br>That o'er the wide-extended down,</br>Glides a fleeting spot of brown.", "When on early breezes borne</br>From far I hear the winding horn,</br>That sweetly pours it's mellow song,</br>Lakes, and groves and hill, among;</br>I saddle strait my neighing steed,</br>And hasten o'er the distant mead,</br>'Till I reach the covert's bound,</br>Ransack'd by the searching hound,</br>The red fox shews his sleeky face,</br>And quits the copse with rapid pace,</br>To safer scenes he fain would fly</br>Like mortals in adversity.</br>Still the deep-mouth'd eager foes,</br>Scent the track where'er he goes,</br>Unwisting every treach'rous maze,</br>That his cunning skill betrays.</br>Then my hasty flight I guide,</br>O'er the mountain's shelvy side,</br>Leave the dang'rous fence behind,</br>Thro many a wood and valley wind,</br>And never quit the pleasing toil,</br>Till I view the dying spoil.", "Oft with careless step I stray,</br>Where unzon'd Nature courts the day,</br>And the tow'ring forest view,</br>Deck'd with tints of varied hue,</br>Or listen to the mingled noise,</br>Of lowing herds, and playful boys,</br>Where seem yon hamlets to retire,</br>And peeps the narrow-pointed spire.</br>Now I throw my roving eye,</br>O'er plashy streams, and mountains high,</br>View the sheep-boy tend his flocks,</br>And wild goats browze the giddy rocks,</br>The careful Driver's long-drawn team,</br>Lather'd by the noon-tide beam,</br>Or hear the ruddy maidens sing,</br>As their gather'd loads they bring.</br>Then I go with curious eyes,</br>Where my lov'd plantations rise,</br>The grafted scion to behold,</br>And young leaves pierce th' obstructive mould;</br>There the virgin lily blows,</br>The streak'd carnation, moss-clad rose,</br>And every flower that opens fair,</br>Scatt'ring odours thro' the air,</br>And every shrub whose head I rear'd,</br>Whose stock with drill drops I cheer'd,</br>Shall purer happiness bestow,</br>Than pow'r and wild ambition know.", "When the day's amusements end,</br>Home my vagrant course I bend,</br>And my slow-returning feet,</br>The faithful Spaniel comes to greet,</br>With his joy-denoting bound,</br>Frisking light in frolick round.</br>Then beside the table plac'd</br>In rural plenty richly grac'd</br>I sit with her, whose tender smile,</br>And sweet discourse the hours beguile:</br>While around, my children gay</br>In many a sportive circle play.", "Then some heart-dear friend appears,</br>Companion of my early years,</br>Who oft reminds me, how, at school,</br>Constraint we scorn'd, and laugh'd at rule,</br>Or when the daily task was o'er,</br>Forth we rushed with rapt'rous roar</br>To strike the ball, or climb the tree,</br>Season of sweet extacy!</br>College pranks recalls to view,</br>Long-past pleasures to renew,</br>Tells how, lover-like, my pain</br>I utter'd on the midnight plain,</br>Nor more the ready scheme enjoy'd,</br>While fonder cares my mind employ'd,</br>But sadly mourn'd the tyrant pride!</br>Of her who blushing sits beside;</br>Entranc'd I mark her conscious sigh,</br>And the blue languish of her eye.</br>Thus the happy Evening goes,</br>'Till the hour of due repose.", "But when wintry tempests rage,</br>Retir'd I read th' historic page,</br>Or with fancied harp I rove,</br>In the wild Parnassian grove.</br>Sweet Poetry!  thy pow'r alone,</br>Can check awhile each bitter groan,</br>When thou point'st to Milton's page,</br>Or Shakespeare's still sublimer rage,</br>And all the heaven-descended crew,</br>Who bath'd their locks with glitt'ring dew,</br>And wove the myrtle garland fair</br>That proudly still thou lov'st to wear</br>Thus my ferried life shall flow,</br>Free from bustle, care, end woe,</br>Such the tranquil joys of home,</br>Never, never, will I roam.</br>"]
