["'Twas at the dark, the solemn hour,</br>When midnight throws its gloom around,</br>When the deep-frowning tempests lour,</br>And the shrill-whistling winds resound</br>Along the forest drear, and o'er the lonely grave;</br>When even the courage of the brave</br>Sinks 'neath the pressure of the sullen shade,</br>When the heart's deceitful visions fade&mdash;</br>Visions of bliss by mortals never known,</br>Since virtue from the earth had flown,</br>And anger bar'd his blood-distilling blade;</br>Lone I wander'd by the tomb,</br>Where a wretch, who, with his keen-edg'd knife,</br>Loos'd the bands that bind the soul to life,</br>And plung'd himself in misery's deepest gloom,</br>Slumber'd in sleep of death profound;</br>Which shall ne'er awake,</br>Till the earth's last trumpet cleaves the solid ground.", "A grisly spectre met my staring sight,</br>Dim as the purple meteor of the night,</br>In robe of gory crimson clad;</br>His clotted hands were smear'd with red,</br>His eye-balls roll'd in frenzy mad,</br>His hollow voice seem'd issuing from the dead.", "\"Shun the gloomy thought, that loves to prey</br>On the heart, and eats the soul away,</br>If you dread a living hell,</br>Nor with misery love to dwell.\"", "He said &mdash; and from the tomb</br>Three yells, like Hyaens rushing on their prey,</br>Burst their rapid way.</br>It seem'd as if the womb,</br>Of those eternal realms of woe and pain,</br>Where agonizing demons reign,</br>Had cleav'd its iron walls again.</br>Soon he vanish'd from my eye,</br>In a show'r of blood that stained the sky.</br>Dreadful was the sight</br>Of that lonely night,</br>Now in ebon darkness veil'd,</br>Now with crimson overspread;</br>So dreadful, that the stoutest heart had quail'd,</br>And even the undaunted brave in breathless terror fled.</br>"]
