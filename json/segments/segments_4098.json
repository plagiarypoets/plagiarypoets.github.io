["Now Phoebus lashing on his steeds,</br>To his utmost zenith speeds;</br>The meek-eye'd Hours that led the prime,</br>Are left behind i' th' eastern clime.</br>High through the void the God of day</br>Rolls his flaming car away;</br>Till the languid herds and sheep</br>Into the woodland covert creep;</br>And the shepherd seeks some glade</br>Embower'd deep in silent shade;</br>Or, when Phoebus rules the sky,</br>Perchance by rushy fount doth lie,</br>Repeating soft his \"love-lorn\" tale</br>To perched hill and shadowy dale;</br>Whilst, reckless of the noon-tide ray,</br>Echoes the jocund village lay</br>Of many a swain and buxom lass</br>Tedding slow the new-mown grass;</br>Till rising on the shaven green,</br>In russet clad, the haycock's seen.</br>Then to Ceres' sultry reign,</br>Hies him on the sun burnt swain;</br>Black-ey'd Phillis by his side</br>Binds the sheaves till even-tide.</br>Then, when Phoebus' swelter'd team</br>Plunges in the Ocean stream,</br>Underneath the fav'rite tree,</br>Welcome rustic jollity.</br>Lo!  the ruddy Hours, that run</br>By the parch'd meridian sun,</br>Are all in golden liv'ries dight,</br>Too gloomy far for human sight;</br>Like orient gems, their flush'd cheeks shine,</br>Their saffron locks the rose entwine;</br>And tipp'd in the tints of Iris' bow,</br>Graceful behind their loose robes flow.</br>Sublime, the great Sun rides on high,</br>And flings his rays along the sky;</br>He tips with gold the mountain's head,</br>And rouses Nature from her bed;</br>Bids prostrate earth receive his fires,</br>And takes the bliss his beam inspires.</br>O!  radiant beam, creative fire!</br>Pleasure's source, and Beauty's fire!</br>Thine is each tint that Summer sees,</br>Or yellow Autumn's bending trees;</br>Thine earlier Spring's enamell'd bow'rs,</br>Her verdant glades, her rising flow'rs.</br>Each breeze that fans the meads at morn,</br>Or bends at noon the shadowy corn;</br>Or wafts at dewy eve the note</br>From plaintive Philomela's throat;</br>Confess thy all-creative ray,</br>Parent of bliss, and source of day!&mdash;</br>Widely spreads th' etherial blaze:</br>Diffus'd o'er all, the fervid rays</br>Glow on the barren mountain's side,</br>And drink the waters as they glide.</br>Deep in the dale the piercing beam</br>Arrests the rustic's drooping team.</br>The cattle lie beneath the thorn,</br>Regardless of the herdsman's horn;</br>The flocks forget the neigh'bring hill,</br>To stand beside the shaded rill.&mdash;</br>At this sultry hour of Noon,</br>Grant me, Heaven, the simple boon,</br>Underneath some poplar's shade,</br>That rears its head in sylvan glade,</br>To throw my listless limbs along,</br>And hear the linnet chaunt her song;</br>Or mark the brook that gliding by,</br>On its surface paints the sky,</br>And reflects its margent green</br>Trimm'd with yellow cowslips seen;</br>And as the waters gently pass</br>Through the long entangled grass,</br>May my thoughts in serious mood</br>Moralise the passing flood,</br>And learn of it to glide along,</br>Unheeded by the bustling throng!</br>And as I keep my noiseless way,</br>Unknown, unthought of by the gay,</br>May I in its surface find</br>The art to make my placid mind</br>Meet all the ills of life resign'd,</br>And still, with philosophic eye,</br>Calmly see the minutes fly!</br>May hours and years that circle round</br>This earthly pinfold's farthest bound,</br>Behold me in their swift advance,</br>Still wrapt in some poetic trance;</br>With dreams of fair elysian meads,</br>And music breath'd on Doric reeds;</br>Or knightly shows of Gothic form,</br>That may my throbbing bosom warm,</br>But yet with such a soften'd glow,</br>As no intemp'rate zeal may know:</br>Then, ere the airy pageant fades,</br>Let me catch the fleeting shades,</br>And draw them in such artful sort</br>As may not labour seem, but sport.</br>Then, if the sultry season lead</br>The high-embow'ring wood to tread,</br>Give me, to make my joys complete,</br>The gentle Laura's converse sweet,</br>But should fate forbid the vale,</br>Let me seek the cloister pale,</br>And there hide me from the eye</br>Of Phoebus when he rideth high;</br>And 'till the purple Ev'ning come,</br>Wond'ring view some arched dome,</br>Where Echo oft in serious sort</br>Doth hold with saints her mimic court:</br>And ever when the organs blow,</br>With solemn movement full and slow,</br>May she to the roofs around</br>Repeat the sacred anthem's sound,</br>With lengthen'd notes and pauses due,</br>Such as once great Handel knew,</br>Till my wrapt soul soaring rise</br>With religious ecstacies.</br>"]
