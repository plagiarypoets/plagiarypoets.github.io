["Come, sea-nymphs, and shew us the place,</br>On the deep or the desolate coast;</br>Where reft from the Muses' embrace,</br>All the pride of our wishes was lost.", "He was manly, and free as his song,</br>He had ev'ry attraction to please;</br>In a storm he was first in the throng,</br>In a calm he was kind as the breeze.", "Ye mariners, gen'rous and bold,</br>He pictur'd you gentle and brave;</br>And can such as his numbers unfold,</br>Dwell at ease on th' boisterous wave?", "From the rocks and the shelves of the main,</br>From each danger he taught you to keep;</br>But my sighs will impede the sad strain,</br>He was whelm'd in the merciless deep.", "No songs shall your labours beguile,</br>Nor resound from th' echoing shore;</br>Since he's gone who could soften your toil,</br>Since the Muse of th' ocean's no more.", "No dolphin the billows shall ride,</br>No sun-beam the dark waves illume;</br>No Nereid disport on the tide,</br>That gave way to so cruel a doom.", "Our hills and our vallies more kind,</br>May the swains to soft melodies move;</br>But the rough roar of ocean and wind,</br>He alone could to music improve.", "So, ye Tritons, who range thro' the deep,</br>If his harp ye should find in your way;</br>Hang it high on some cloud-piercing steep,</br>For no hand but his own 'twill obey.</br>"]
