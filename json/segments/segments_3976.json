["Ye swains who inhabit the green,</br>Ye have heard that my Phillida's dead!</br>In your looks the sad tidings are seen,</br>And her worth in your grief may be read.", "Oh!  was she not lovely and fair!</br>Has she scarce left such beauty behind!</br>And yet what was that to compare</br>With the graces which dwelt in her mind?", "But let me not think of her charms,</br>How I lov'd her my verse cannot tell;</br>Death has snatch'd her away from my arms,</br>With angels alone must she dwell.", "In vain may I utter my grief,</br>Her loss the whole world can't supply;</br>Death only will give me relief,</br>To him then with pleasure I fly.", "Oh!  shew me the way to my fair;</br>Lead me on to the regions of bliss;</br>And, sure as my love was sincere,</br>I will praise thee, kind victor, for this.</br>"]
