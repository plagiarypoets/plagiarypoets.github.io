["How swift the decline of the year!</br>December how chearless thy frown!</br>The knell of the fast-flowing year</br>Depresses both village and town.</br>O come Meditation, thou queen</br>Of pleasures, tho' pensive yet gay;</br>For thou can'st enliven the scene,</br>And lengthen the short-living day.", "Emotions which flow from thy song,</br>Are smiles of content to the breast,</br>Are raptures that sweetly prolong</br>The whispers of peace and of rest:</br>What tho' the pale Season denies</br>The beauties which brighten the spring,</br>Contentment's the much-envied prize,</br>Meditation's the cherub to bring.", "When odours replenish the gale,</br>The streamlets run purling along,</br>The zephyrs which softly prevail,</br>And Philomel issues her song:</br>The reed of sweet music display'd,</br>In notes unambitiously wild;</br>The pleasures alive in the shade,</br>When nature is placid and mild.", "When Flora awakens the flow'rs,</br>Her children of purest perfume,</br>Descend in refreshment the show'rs,</br>To strengthen the innocent bloom:</br>When nature, with face of delight,</br>Diffuses her bounties around,</br>Creation that's new to the sight,</br>By the hand of young Extacy's crown'd.", "When the landskip with transport descry'd</br>The summer holds forth to the view,</br>In robes too expressive of pride,</br>Tho' the mirror of nature is true;</br>When autumn rough labour repays,</br>And plenty wide-scatters her crops,</br>Diffuses her earth-gilding rays</br>Thro' gardens thick-cluster'd with hops.", "When summer, or autumn, or spring,</br>Their treasures alternate dispense,</br>Their vicissitudes joyfully bring</br>The grateful remembrance of sense;</br>But winter, tho' wrapt in a cloud,</br>A gratitude warmer excites,</br>For virtue dares publish aloud,</br>That December is fraught with delights.", "Devotion, elate at the sound,</br>Her incense prepares for the morn,</br>When tidings of gladness around</br>Proclaim that a Saviour was born;</br>Superlative news to the breast,</br>Replete with the faith most divine,</br>Where thy virtues, sweet innocence, rest,</br>And religion's best triumph is thine.", "Let warm acclamations ascend,</br>Festivity, Temp'rance, be near,</br>And Charity, Virtue's fast friend,</br>The head of pale sorrow uprear.</br>Let Wealth all her scorn lay aside,</br>To Poverty's cottage repair,</br>Experience, the soul-lifting pride,</br>In robbing Distress of a care.</br>"]
