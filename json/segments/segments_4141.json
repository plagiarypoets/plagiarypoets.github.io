["Far from Ambition's selfish train,</br>Where Avarice rules the busy day,</br>And patient Folly \"hugs his chain,\"</br>Enslav'd by Custom's ruthless sway,</br>Lead me, calm spirit!  to some still retreat,</br>Where science shares with thee the blooming mead,</br>Save when at distance heard, in cadence sweet,</br>The village minstrel tunes his simple reed.</br>There, free from cares, from jarring passions free,</br>Oft may I strike the lyre, sweet Solitude!  to thee.", "When orient Morn, in blushing pride,</br>Profusely sheds the glist'ning dew,</br>Oft let me climb the mountain's side,</br>And raptur'd mark the varied view.</br>When Noon directs on earth his parching ray;</br>Then let me find the cool, the peaceful shade,</br>Form'd by embow'ring oaks, in firm array,</br>O'er some small stream that rustles through the glade.</br>Thither let Fancy lead her magic band,</br>And o'er my senses wave her soul-entrancing wand.", "But when at eve the curfew's knell</br>Winds slowly thro' the dusky grove,</br>Pensive I'll seek the rural cell,</br>Or 'midst the gloom in silence rove;</br>And when from village spire the solemn toll</br>Yields its sad tribute to the breathless clay;</br>As calm Reflection steals upon my soul,</br>The tear unmark'd shall take its silent way;</br>And mounted oft I'll cull the violet's bloom,</br>Heave the sad soothing sigh, and dress the clay-cold tomb.", "When Midnight spreads her blackest robe,</br>And shrouds in sullen mists the sky;&mdash;</br>When Terror rules the silent globe,</br>And phantoms mock the fearful eye;</br>Parent of all!  whose voice the winds obey,</br>The raving ocean, and the black'ning storm,</br>Yet stoop'st to guide the sparrow on his way,</br>And shed'st thy mercy on the struggling worm!</br>To thee, great God!  to thee my voice I'll raise;</br>Trembling I'll strike the lyre, and hymn thy boundless praise.</br>"]
