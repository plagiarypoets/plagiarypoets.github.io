["E'en in the youth and playtime of our days,</br>There is a death the very living die,</br>'Tis when its votaries love betrays,</br>And man beholds his social comforts fly,&mdash;</br>Each lov'd-one turn with cold averted eye,</br>Shunn'd by his brethren &mdash; like a stricken deer,</br>What then shall healing to his heart apply?</br>What wipe away the constant falling tear?</br>What &mdash; but the hand of death that lays him on his bier?</br>"]
