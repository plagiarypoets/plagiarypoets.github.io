["The guard behind the coach had blown his horn,</br>The Felons on the roof had clink'd their chains,</br>When Campbell's guest, herself a Campbell born,</br>With graceful jirk to mount the ladder deigns.", "A Merchant at her side, who dealt in coals,</br>But now, gazetted, in the Bankrupt line;</br>Caressing and caress'd she bumps and rolls,</br>Though Faith and Cotton at their loss repine.", "Their dinner, two and sixpence by the head,</br>A shilling is the lunch, and sixpence tea,</br>The heart of Griskin for the Felons bled,</br>Ale was her gift, compassion was her plea.", "When at the Borough they at length arriv'd,</br>Their lingering wheels of Lad pursued the Lane,</br>There honours crown'd her, there preferments thriv'd,</br>And Griskin is of Donald's bridal train.</br>"]
