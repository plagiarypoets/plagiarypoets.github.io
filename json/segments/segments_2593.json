["By triple walls and brazen towers,</br>And frowning parapets sustain'd,</br>Tho' Magdeburg defied the powers</br>Of war, and every foe disdain'd;</br>Yet won, like Danae, by gold,</br>Her pride succumbs, her gates unfold,</br>She sells the ravisher her venal charms,</br>And finds, (alas too late!)  destruction in his arms.", "Almighty gold, to thy control,</br>Man is the ever yielding slave;</br>As thy behests transform his soul,</br>The true are false, the timid brave.&mdash;</br>By thee, the Prussian king, betray'd,</br>Saw his fair realms in ruin laid;</br>By thee, Napoleon bought his iron crown,</br>By thee, the lance was tipp'd, that dash'd his rivals down.", "Yet why should mortals, blind to fate,</br>For thee exchange their peace and rest;</br>And madly gorge thy fatal bait,</br>Until it rankles in the breast.</br>Wealth has a long and hideous train</br>Of terror, doubt, disease, and pain,</br>While o'er the lowly unambitious head,</br>The Heavenly powers, unask'd, their silent blessings shed.", "Slave to no love of pomp or place,</br>And rich because my wants are few,</br>I scorn the struggling, greedy race,</br>Who fortune's gifts incessant woo.</br>Far happier in my humble lot,</br>My modest wealth and quiet cot,</br>Than if, possessing an exhaustless store,</br>My discontented heart petition'd still for more.", "Let nobles vaunt their high degrees,</br>Their stars that clothe an aching heart;</br>Let merchants toss our golden seas,</br>And tremble lest the waves should part;</br>They know not that my cot and field,</br>To me such tranquil pleasures yield,</br>As they in splendid mansions ne'er possess'd,</br>Tho' born of royal stock, or nurs'd on Fortune's breast.", "What tho' no gilded domes be mine,</br>No crested carriage wait my call,</br>No goblets foam with Gallic wine,</br>No gaudy servants crowd my hall;</br>The lord of all this empty wealth,</br>Stranger alike to peace and health,</br>Would gladly see his dearest treasures spent,</br>To buy my little cot, embellish'd by content.</br>"]
