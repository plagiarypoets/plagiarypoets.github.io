["All languages she reads with learned eye,</br>The Roman, German, Hindostan and Greek;</br>Nor of her treasured languages is shy, </br>But ever and anon will learned speak,</br>As naturally as injured pig does squeak;</br>And then she swells, and looks so mighty big,</br>(Like straining frog in some unhealthy creek,)</br>And shoots her leathern neck, and shakes her leg,</br>From every sitter by some eulogy to beg.", "All little things she deems beneath her care,</br>And silent sits at dinner or at tea,</br>Filling with maiden grace an armed chair,</br>(Full maiden like, I ween, and chaste is she,</br>As maids at fifty-five are wont to be,)</br>Till roused by fell Contention's iron sway,</br>Adieu to social talk, in company;</br>Ten thousand asses would not raise a bray</br>So full of terror dread, and deaf'ning wild affray.", "In silence oft', she heaves the deepened sigh,</br>For woman's fate, and man's relentless sway,</br>Lamenting such as wedlock's bands do tie;</br>Ah, that they ere had known a bridal day!</br>But rather deemed in privacy to stay,</br>And pass their days in independent ease,</br>Than every nobler sentient betray;</br>And for the paltry luxury, &mdash; to please,</br>Forego that maiden paradise, &mdash; to teaze.</br>"]
