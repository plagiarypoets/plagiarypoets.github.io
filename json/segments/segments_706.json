["I.</br>While, lost to all his former Mirth,</br>Britannia's Genius bends to Earth,</br>And mourns the fatal Day;</br>While, stained with Blood, he strives to tear</br>Unseemly from his Sea-green Hair</br>The Wreaths of chearful May;", "II.</br>The Thoughts which musing Pity pays,</br>And fond Remembrance loves to raise,</br>Your faithful Hours attend;</br>Still Fancy, to herself unkind,</br>Awakes to Grief the soften'd Mind,</br>And points the bleeding Friend.", "III.</br>By rapid Scheldt's descending Wave,</br>His Country's Vows shall bless the Grave,</br>Where'er the Youth is laid:</br>That sacred Spot the Village Hind</br>With every sweetest Turf shall bind,</br>And Peace protect the Shade.", "IV.</br>Ev'n now, regardful of thy Doom,</br>Applauding Honour haunts his Tomb,</br>With shadowy Trophies crown'd:</br>Whilst Freedom's Form beside her roves</br>Majestic thro' the twilight Groves,</br>And calls her Heroes round.", "V.</br>The warlike Dead of ev'ry Age,</br>Who fill the fair recording Page,</br>Shall leave their sainted Rest:</br>And half-reclining on his Spear,</br>Each wond'ring Chief by turns appear</br>To hail the blooming Guest.", "VI.</br>Old Edward's sons, unknown to yield,</br>Shall croud from Cressy's laurell'd Field,</br>And gaze with fix'd Delight:</br>Again for Britain's Wrongs they feel,</br>Again they snatch the gleamy Steel,</br>And wish th' avenging Fight.", "VII.</br>If, weak to sooth so soft a Heart,</br>These pictur'd Glories nought impart</br>To dry thy constant Tear;</br>If yet in Sorrow's distant Eye,</br>Expos'd and pale thou seest him lie,</br>Wild War insulting near:", "VIII.</br>Where'er from Time Thou court'st Relief,</br>The Muse shall still with social Grief</br>Her gentlest Promise keep:</br>Even humble H&mdash;'s cottag'd Vale</br>Shall learn the sad repeated Tale,</br>And bid her Shepherds weep.</br>"]
