["Ye breezes mild and gentle gales,</br>Whose breath proptitious fills the swelling sails,</br>And bids the vessel swiftly glide</br>Thro' angry seas, and stem the stubborn tide,</br>O whither, whither will ye bear me hence</br>To haughty pow'r a slave and lawless insolence?", "Will ye alas!  in Doric lands</br>Subject me to some proud Greek's stern commands?</br>Or waft me to the fertile coast</br>Of Pthia, where in wand'ring mazes lost</br>The fam'd Apidanus rolls his silver floods</br>Thro' meads of verdant hue, and shadowy darkling woods?", "Or must I to the isle repair</br>Select and sacred to LATONA fair,</br>Where verdant laurels never sear</br>And lofty pines their blooming branches rear;</br>To join the youthful choir's united voice,</br>And sing of DIAN chaste, whose care the bow employs.", "For lofty Athens must I part,</br>To shade the curious vest with nicest art,</br>To paint MINERVA'S glorious car,</br>Adorn the tapestry with scenes of war,</br>Or point the forked bolt with flaming rage,</br>On Titans hurl'd, that durst heav'n's awful king engage?", "See, blazing fires from hapless Ilion rise,</br>While clouds of circling smoke obscure the skies,</br>O dire distress!  why only am I left,</br>Of children, parents, brethren, all bereft?</br>Why thus reserv'd a prey to proud domain,</br>Far hence in foreign lands to drag the galling chain?</br>"]
