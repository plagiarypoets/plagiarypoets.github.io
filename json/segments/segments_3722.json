["Ah!  whither, alas!  shall I fly?</br>What clime shall I seek for relief?</br>Since PHILLIS no longer is nigh,</br>O!  how shall I smother my grief.</br>The sweetest, the fairest, is she&mdash;</br>So neatly she trips o'er the plain;</br>But now she ne'er smiles upon me,</br>She's faithless &mdash; and false to her swain.", "With STREPHON she's gone far away&mdash;</br>With him is contented and blest,</br>Whilst I am distracted all day,</br>And ruin'd for want of my rest.</br>No heed can I take of my sheep,</br>They ramble and roam as they please,</br>For I can do nothing but weep</br>'Till PHILLIS my sorrow doth ease.", "Dear nymph hear thy shepherd complain,</br>Return and subdue all my care!</br>No longer torment me with pain,</br>For constant I am, I declare.</br>Thy charms ever shall be my pride,</br>Thy smiles I will ever admire;</br>Then deign you to be but my bride,</br>And satisfy all my desire.</br>"]
