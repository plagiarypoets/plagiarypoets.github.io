["Indifference hence!  I loathe thy listless reign;</br>I loathe that torpid power which lulls thy soul;</br>Thy boasted freedom from all pain,</br>My manlier mind shall ne'er controul:</br>Ne'er shall the shame of feeling for distress,</br>Thy brutal charms enhance or make my transports less.", "Rather may lightest griefs dissolve,</br>And deepest tears for ever glow;</br>For ever other's ills involve,</br>Than lost this heart to sympathetic woe!</br>What though no cries thy pity move,</br>No agonizing shrieks thy selfish love;</br>What though misfortunes not appal,</br>And orphan wretches vainly call;</br>Yet say &mdash; are these the weighty joys</br>Thy lifeless votaries so much prize?</br>Are these, sure emblems of a giant vice,</br>The alien comforts that entice?</br>Delusive thought!  such bliss be thine;</br>To read the soul, and feel, are mine.", "Sparkles the tear in Virtue's eye,</br>My bosom heaves the honest sigh;</br>Meets my shock'd sight the vagrant child,</br>My ev'ry softer sense grows wild:</br>The change I hail &mdash; I hail the start,</br>And stamp his injur'd form full on my bleeding heart.", "Not so thy lost lethargic mind;</br>To all &mdash; ev'n to thyself unkind.</br>For know, to such of human race</br>As Sensibility embrace,</br>Though hardest woes more hard appear,</br>Severest sorrows more severe,</br>Reverse the scene, thou soon shalt find,</br>The kindest comforts yet more kind,</br>The happiest hour more happy still,</br>More warm the tend'rest warmest will.</br>Hence then, Indifference hence!  nor dare to stay:</br>Thy torpid power I loathe &mdash; I loathe thy listless sway.</br>"]
