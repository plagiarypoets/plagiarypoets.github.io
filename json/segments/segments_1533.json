["The hinds how blest, who ne'er beguil'd</br>To quit their hamlet's hawthorn-wild;</br>Nor haunt the croud, nor tempt the main,</br>For splendid care, and guilty gain!", "When morning's twilight-tinctur'd beam</br>Strikes their low thatch with flaming gleam,</br>They rove abroad in ether blue,</br>To dip the scythe in fragrant dew:</br>The sheaf to bind, the beech to fell</br>That nodding shades a craggy dell.", "Midst gloomy shades, in warbles clear,</br>Wild nature's sweetest notes they hear:</br>On green untrodden banks they view</br>The hyacinth's neglected hue:</br>In their lone haunts, and woodland rounds,</br>They spy the squirrel's airy bounds:</br>And startle from her ashen spray,</br>Across the glen, the screaming jay:</br>Each native charm their steps explore</br>Of Solitude's sequester'd store.", "For them the moon with cloudless ray</br>Mounts, to illume their homeward way:</br>Their weary spirits to relieve,</br>The meadows incense breathe at eve.</br>No riot mars the simple fare</br>That o'er a glimmering hearth they share:</br>But when the curfeu's measur'd roar</br>Duly, the darkening vallies o'er,</br>Has echoed from the distant town,</br>They wish no beds of cygnet-down,</br>No trophied canopies, to close</br>Their drooping eyes in quick repose.", "Their humble porch with honied flowers</br>The curling woodbine's shade embowers:</br>From the trim garden's thymy mound</br>Their bees in busy swarms resound:</br>Nor fell Disease, before his time,</br>Hastes to consume life's golden prime:</br>But when their temples long have wore</br>The silver crown of tresses hoar;</br>As studious still calm peace to keep,</br>Beneath a flowery turf they sleep.</br>"]
