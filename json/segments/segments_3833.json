["Ye nymphs from Parnassus descend,</br>Contribute your aid to my verse;</br>The humblest of bards now befriend,</br>And the merits of SHENSTONE rehearse.", "The loveliest of swains now is fled,</br>Who painted the verdure of May;</br>Who rural diversions display'd,</br>And sung the sweet pastoral lay.", "His numbers, which flow with such ease,</br>Such tender emotions impart,</br>As might the most savage appease,</br>Or touch the most obdurate heart.", "What Muse can with Shenstone's compare?</br>Like him sing the sports of the plain?</br>Or melt the soft hearts of the fair,</br>In Elegy's tenderer strain?", "Not a song did their bard e'er compose,</br>That was not both pure and refin'd;</br>Such amazing variety shows</br>The turn of an elegant mind.", "Had his bosom ne'er felt the soft flame,</br>He ne'er had pourtray'd it so well;</br>That he felt it, and nourish'd the same,</br>The strains of his Corydon tell.</br>"]
