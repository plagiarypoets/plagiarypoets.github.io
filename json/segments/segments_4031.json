["NORTH!  many a time upon thy glory musing,</br>Mid leafiness, I roam up Hampstead Hill,</br>When through white clouds Apollo is infusing</br>Brightness, and milk-maids kneel their pails to fill,</br>Beside the meek cow ruminant.  I feel</br>That thou hast beat and buffeted me about,</br>More than the cook-maid doth an old dish-clout;</br>Yet I must still admire thee; &mdash; ribs of steel,</br>Like Spenser's man, are thine; thou carest not</br>For blows from soft Italian palms like mine.</br>Since it must be so, brightly mayst thou shine,</br>And long.  I came to curse, but I cannot;</br>Therefore, may thy bright fountain never fail,</br>And Wisdom's long-jerk'd feather o'er thee swale!</br>"]
