["How pleasingly glided the day,</br>When Phillis vouchsaf'd to confess,</br>Whatever young Damon cou'd say</br>At once gave her pleasure and bliss!", "But now how revers'd is the scene,</br>No more the sweet maiden complains,</br>\"Your bosom by far's too serene,</br>And ne'er to the lover attains.\"", "Ah!  with what delight have I strove</br>My passion sincerely to shew,</br>When Phillis thus doubted my love,</br>And thought that my pulse beat too slow!", "Those galloping moments of bliss,</br>Distraction!  no more can be prov'd!</br>No more can I steal a sweet kiss</br>From her I so ardently lov'd!", "No more the soft transports are mine</br>When Phillis from Hymen was free,</br>When she'd on my bosom recline,</br>And vow that she lov'd only me.", "No more can we wander the plains</br>Where lillies and eglantine grow!</br>No more am I envy'd by swains</br>With love who appeared to glow!", "For none cou'd a nymph so divine</br>Behold without seeming t' admire;</br>Then pleasures how great must be mine,</br>When blest with the purest desire!", "When Phillis, a damsel so fair,</br>Was all that I wish'd her to be;</br>How void was my mind of all care,</br>My bosom from tortures how free!", "But oh!  how inconstant are they</br>Whom nature has form'd to be fair!</br>How charming!  how lovely and gay!</br>More safely to rivet the share!</br>"]
