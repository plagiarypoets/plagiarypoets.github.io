["To Troynovant, now called London, ride,</br>By new fair buildings daily beautifide,</br>And great resort of people; There thou maist</br>See how the Thames under a Bridge doth hast</br>Of nineteen Arches; That so fair an other,</br>And strangely built, is scarce all Europe over.</br>There thou maist see the famous Monuments</br>Of our Heroes, fram'd with large expence:</br>There thou upon the Sepulchre maist look</br>Of Chaucer, our true Ennius, whose old book</br>Hath taught our Nation so to Poetize,</br>That English rythmes now any equalize;</br>That we no more need envy at the straine</br>Of Tiber, Tagus, or our neighbour Seine.</br>There Spencers Tomb thou likewise maist behold,</br>Which he deserved, were it made of gold:</br>If, honour'd Colin, thou hadst liv'd so long,</br>As to have finished thy Faery Song,</br>Not onely mine, but all tongues would confess,</br>Thou hadst exceeded old Maeonides. . . .", "Trinity Colledge (unto which I do</br>For my own education my self owe)</br>Invites thee to behold a spacious Court</br>And what it is, afterwards to report:</br>That Royal Fabrick rais'd by him that died</br>By Crook-backs hands, and is so magnified,</br>For that strange roof, will doubtless thee invite</br>(Within the walls) of it to take a sight.</br>For Colins sake (who hath so well exprest</br>The vertues of our Faery Elves, and drest</br>Our Poesie in suth a gallant guise)</br>On happy Pembroke-Hall employ thine eyes.</br>Oxford our other Academy, you</br>Full worthy must acknowledge of your view:</br>Here smooth-tongu'd Drayton was inspired by</br>Mnemosynes's manifold progenie;</br>And Sydney (honour'd by all English men)</br>In Castalie here dip'd his numerous pen. . . .", "Beware of reading Love; take heed of those</br>That either pourtract him in verse or prose:</br>For amorous lines will many mischiefs raise,</br>And make the Cinders of affection blaze.</br>Though the Arcadia be a book approv'd,</br>Arcadia must not be by thee belov'd.</br>The Lady Wrothes Urania is repleat</br>With elegancies, but too full of heat.</br>Spencers and Daniels Sonets do not view,</br>Though they are good, they are not so for you.</br>From feigned Histories refrain thy sight,</br>Scarce one is there but is an amorous Knight.</br>Musaeus English'd by two Poets shun;</br>It may undo you though it be well done.</br>Harrington's Ariosto do not touch,</br>For wanton lines scarce any book hath such.</br>And my old friend Drayton's Epistles you</br>(Being too soft and languishing) eschew.</br>"]
