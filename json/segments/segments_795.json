["Ah mourn, thou lov'd retreat!  No more</br>Shall classic steps thy scenes explore!</br>When morn's pale rays but faintly peep</br>O'er yonder oak-crown'd airy steep,</br>Who now shall climb its brows to view</br>The length of landskips, ever new;</br>Where Summer flings, in careless pride,</br>Her varied vesture far and wide!</br>Who mark, beneath, each village-charm,</br>Or grange, or elm-encircled farm:</br>The flinty dove-cote's crouded roof,</br>Watch'd by the kite that sails aloof:</br>The tufted pines, whose umbrage tall</br>Darkens the long-deserted hall:</br>The veteran beech, that on the plain</br>Collects at eve the playful train:</br>The cott that smokes with early fire,</br>The low-roof'd fane's embosom'd spire!</br>Who now shall indolently stray</br>Through the deep forest's tangled way;</br>Pleas'd at his custom'd task to find</br>The well known hoary-tressed hind,</br>That toils with feeble hands to glean</br>Of wither'd boughs his pittance mean!</br>Who mid thy nooks of hazle sit,</br>Lost in some melancholy fit;</br>And listening to the raven's croak,</br>The distant flail, the falling oak!</br>Who, wandering at return of May,</br>Catch the first cuckow's vernal lay?</br>Who, musing waste the summer hour,</br>Where high o'er-arching trees embower</br>The grassy lane, so rarely pac'd,</br>With azure flow'rets idly grac'd!</br>Unnotic'd now, at twilight's dawn</br>Returning reapers cross the lawn;</br>Nor fond attention loves to note</br>The weather's bell from folds remote:</br>While, own'd by no poetic eye,</br>Thy pensive evenings shade the sky!</br>For lo!  the Bard who rapture found</br>From every rural sight or sound;</br>Whose genius warm, and judgment chaste,</br>No charm of genuine nature past;</br>Who felt the Muse's purest fires,</br>Far from thy favour'd haunt retires:</br>Who peopled all thy vocal bowers</br>With shadowy shapes, and airy powers.", "And see, thy sad sequester'd glooms</br>Their antient, dread repose resumes!</br>From the deep dell, where shaggy roots</br>Fringe the rough brink with wreathed shoots,</br>Th' unwilling Genius flies forlorn,</br>His primrose-chaplet rudely torn.</br>With hollow shriek the Nymphs forsake</br>The pathless copse, and hedge-row brake.</br>Where the delv'd mountain's headlong side</br>Its chalky entrails opens wide,</br>On the green summit, ambush'd high,</br>No longer Echo loves to lie.</br>No pearl-crown'd Maids, with wily look,</br>Rise beckoning from the reedy brook.</br>Around the glow-worm's glimmering bank,</br>No Fairies run in fiery rank;</br>Nor brush, half-seen, in airy tread,</br>The violet's unprinted head.</br>But Fancy, from the thickets brown,</br>The glades that wear a conscious frown,</br>The forest-oaks, that pale and lone,</br>Nod to the blast with hoarser tone,</br>Rough glens, and sullen waterfalls,</br>Her bright ideal offspring calls.", "So by some sage inchanter's spell,</br>(As old Arabian fablers tell)</br>Amid the solitary wild,</br>Luxuriant gardens gaily smil'd:</br>From sapphire rocks the fountains stream'd,</br>With golden fruit the branches beam'd;</br>Fair forms, in every wonderous wood,</br>Or lightly tripp'd, or solemn stood;</br>And oft, retreating from the view,</br>Betray'd, at distance, beauties new:</br>While gleaming o'er the crisped bowers</br>Rich spires arose, and sparkling towers.", "If bound on service new to go,</br>The master of the magic show,</br>His transitory charm withdrew,</br>Away th' illusive landscape flew:</br>Dun clouds obscur'd the groves of gold,</br>Blue lightning smote the blooming mold:</br>In visionary glory rear'd,</br>The gorgeous castle disappear'd;</br>And a bare heath's unfruitful plain</br>Usurp'd the wisard's proud domain.</br>"]
