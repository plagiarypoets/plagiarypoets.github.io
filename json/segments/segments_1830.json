["Beside the confines of the Aegean main,</br>Where northward Macedonia bounds the flood,</br>And views opposed the Asiatic plain,</br>Where once the pride of lofty Ilion stood,</br>Like the great Father of the giant brood,</br>With lowering port majestic Athos stands,</br>Crowned with the verdure of eternal wood,</br>As yet unspoiled by sacrilegious hands,</br>And throws his mighty shade o'er seas and distant lands.", "And deep embosomed in his shady groves</br>Full many a convent rears its glittering spire,</br>Mid scenes where Heavenly Contemplation loves</br>To kindle in her soul her hallowed fire,</br>Where air and sea with rocks and woods conspire</br>To breathe a sweet religious calm around,</br>Weaning the thoughts from every low desire,</br>And the wild waves that break with murmuring sound</br>Along the rocky shore proclaim it holy ground.", "Sequestered shades where Piety has given</br>A quiet refuge from each earthly care,</br>Whence the rapt spirit may ascend to Heaven!</br>[In holy strains of Penitence and Prayer&mdash;]</br>Oh, ye condemned the ills of life to bear!</br>As with advancing age your woes increase,</br>What bliss amidst these solitudes to share</br>The happy foretaste of eternal Peace,</br>Till Heav'n in mercy bids your pain and sorrows cease.</br>"]
