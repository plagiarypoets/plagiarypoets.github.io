["Like to the forked lightning is my thought,</br>Scathing each tender thing whereon it lights,</br>And, like the cloud, it bursts from, I am brought</br>To live as in the gloomiest of Earth's nights.</br>My bosom, like the heaving ocean, frights</br>The head that rests upon it by its throws;</br>And this it is to dare the poet's flights,</br>To soar to heaven, yet wail o'er worldly woes.</br>Oh, he who feels thus hapless, sadly knows</br>'Tis indescribable.  It is a state</br>Which speech, if from an angel's tongue it flows,</br>Can never tell; and mine is such a fate,</br>I've purified my feelings, 'till I've grown</br>Too sensitive, and know my heart it is not stone.</br>"]
