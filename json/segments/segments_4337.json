["SCENE:  AN AMERICAN LOG HOUSE, WITH A LITTLE PLANTATION.  TIME, SUN-SET.", "The evening airs in southern breezes play'd,</br>Amongst the maples, thro' the forest's shade.</br>O'er leaves of aspin trembling seem'd to sigh,</br>Or lost in sweets, on fragrant peaches lie&mdash;</br>The sun unsullied mov'd to ocean's bed</br>The chirping birds hung down the weary head:</br>All nature tranquil breath'd serene repose,</br>Sublimely silent at the evening's close.", "A lonely cot uprear'd its humble head;</br>Around, an orchard various fruitage spread.</br>A simple plat (with herbs and roots supplied)</br>Slop'd gently bending to a river's side.</br>A cultur'd field, unhedg'd by ragged thorn,</br>Bloom'd rich with variegated Indian corn:</br>Calm silence reign'd at evening's peaceful hour,</br>Mild was her reign, and gentle was her pow'r:</br>When on a spangled green with violets gay,</br>A planter sat, to see his children play:</br>Till tired with sport, they round their parents move</br>To ask caresses, or new gifts of love;</br>When thus the planter, on a turf-rais'd seat,</br>Lean'd on his wife, and kiss'd his children sweet.", "\"My sons,\" said he, \"your father's voice attend,</br>My voice, the council of a faithful friend&mdash;</br>Beyond these woods, which sweep the flying clouds,</br>Whose wide-spread arms our humble cot enshrouds:</br>Beyond these woods, which with creation rose,</br>A mighty water everlasting flows:</br>A lake of waves thought scarce can traverse o'er,</br>Land links to Land, and fastens shore to shore.</br>There storms and tempests lash the sounding main,</br>The shuddering shores their fury scarce sustain:</br>Billows rough, boiling, rude as mountains hurl'd,</br>Shake the foundations of the frighted world.</br>Beyond the ocean other countries lay,</br>Where arts and commerce shine in bright display,</br>Where cities rise midst luxury and ease,</br>And pamper'd folly riots in disease.</br>There selfish men arrest the bounteous store,</br>Given by high Heaven alike to rich and poor.</br>Self-interest rules &mdash; self interest each divides,</br>Burns in the soul, and in the heart resides.</br>Friendship, and love, and all domestic ties</br>Shrink from the towns, and to the country flies;</br>Mingled with pomp, pale misery appears,</br>And weeping virtue drinks down silent tears.</br>The dawning youth exulting in his power,</br>Heeds not the gulph, wide opening to devour;</br>Feels not the sting, which pleasures leave behind,</br>When virtue fails to influence the mind.</br>The maid whose virgin charms might touch the heart,</br>Enkindle love, and noble thoughts impart,</br>Impel to deeds of more than mortal mould,</br>Moves not the feelings if undeck'd with gold:</br>Or if she shines in beauty fair and bright</br>She shines alone the ruffian to invite.</br>Cut down in early youth, n o hand to save</br>She sinks a sorrowing victim to the grave.\"", "\"There men on men, on nations, nations prey,</br>In mad rebellion, brothers, brothers slay.</br>Loud-sounding knaves, in freedom's sacred name,</br>Engender strife, and set the world in flame:</br>Self-tutor'd censors mock religion's rod,</br>Bend down to nature, scoff at nature's God.\"", "\"There, for less hire than vagrant reapers know,</br>Man destroys man, an undistinguished foe.</br>The weeping mother sees her children die,</br>And bleeding virgins join the general cry.</br>Rude slaughter strides thro' countries red with gore,</br>And lisping infants learn to lisp no more.</br>The lordly domes, religion's sacred fanes,</br>Swell the dark flame that rolls along the plains.</br>Resounding arms harsh mingle in the air;</br>Arts, science, learning, general ruin share,</br>Yet &mdash; yet, my sons, should foreign foes invade,</br>Protect your partners in your humble shade.</br>When the shrill trump sounds in your country's cause</br>Defend your homes, your children, and your laws:</br>Rush to the fight, and dare the generous strife,</br>Nor yield the contest but with yielding life.\"", "\"But O my darlings, whatso'er betide,</br>Lend not a listening ear to flattering pride:</br>Tempt not the height where giddy breezes play,</br>Deep, wide destruction spreads beneath the way.</br>For you is spread profusely nature's store,</br>Reason with prudence can require no more.</br>The gem that sparkles in the blaze of day,</br>In sick'ning mines emits no lust'rous ray;</br>The silken robe that flowing gay appears,</br>Is oft times watered with the workman's tears.\"", "\"Here, bless'd by love, beneath the blushing vine,</br>A blooming offspring shall around you twine.</br>Your daughters fair, pure as unsullied snow,</br>Like opening flowers shall blossom where they grow.</br>No blighting wind of lust or wealth shall tear,</br>Or strew their beauties in the barren air.</br>Beneath the peach-trees shall their children play,</br>And teeming harvest every toil repay.</br>When tranquil ev'ning tempts your souls to rest,</br>A pleasing calmness shall o'erspread your breast;</br>As yonder sun declining to the wave,</br>Shall you serene move onward to the grave;</br>Your children's children shall around you lay,</br>Till time shall rise in sempeternal day.\"", "\"The parting wave which from the ocean strays,</br>Engreens the mountains, thro' the vallies plays,</br>Midst banks of flowers, where nature sheds her sweets,</br>And pensive silence from the world retreats,</br>Then with some river, rapid, rough, and strong,</br>Confluent rolls its deepening course along;</br>Or gently winding, into calm subsides,</br>Where some fair garden drinks the dimp'ling tides,</br>Here close imprison'd in a marble pool,</br>(Where modest nymphs the summer heats may cool)</br>It shines a fountain &mdash; lost in airy play,</br>Whose drops prismatic gems and tints display.</br>But still it murmurs, still it sad complains,</br>Thro' verdant meadows, or thro' sterile plains:</br>The sea alone, from whence at first it rose,</br>Can lull those murmurs into still repose.</br>The mighty ocean spreads a boundless deep,</br>Where all its wanderings and its cares may sleep.\"", "He ceas'd &mdash; the nightingale took up the strain,</br>And softly plaintive, pour'd a lov'd complain;</br>The fire fly glitter'd thro' the foliage green:</br>With streaming lustre sparkling o'er the scene.</br>The pious parents then their voices raise;</br>Their lovely children join the song of praise;</br>Such as was heard at evening's sacred hour,</br>Ere guilt was known in paracidial bow'r.</br>"]
