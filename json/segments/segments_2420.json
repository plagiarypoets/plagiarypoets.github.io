["O lovely, tender flow'ret of the morn,</br>The fairest rose of flower-bespangled May;</br>What gentle smiles thy blooming free adorn,</br>In youthful freshness innocently gay.</br>Here, while along these grassy banks I stray,</br>Rememberance wakes thee in my feeling breast:</br>And with affection's warmly melting lay,</br>My heart steals after thee in peace to rest;</br>And, knit with thy sweet soul, to live with rapture blest.", "How oft we wander'd through the fields of spring,</br>And gather'd golden fruit in baskets fair,</br>And heard the thrilling red-breast carolling</br>Its notes of joy, which pierced the scented air;</br>And when on beds of crimson roses there,</br>Where beechen trees had form'd a colling shade,</br>While curling ringlets of soft auburn hair</br>Were o'er thy face in loveliest form display'd,</br>We read the pleasing tales which Shakspeare child of nature, made.", "O those were hours of bliss, divinely sweet,</br>Too dear to linger long in this dark vale of woe;</br>Hours which like morning dews will swiftly fleet,</br>And but the loved remembrance ling'ring show;</br>So short-lived is delight while here below!</br>Yet since I left thee, kindest sister, dear,</br>And kiss'd thy melting lips with rapture's glow,</br>Oft to my musing mind will bright appear</br>That soul-felt hour, and draw a swelling, heart-shed tear.</br>"]
