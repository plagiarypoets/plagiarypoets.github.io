["Ye shepherds so chearful and gay,</br>Who wanton it over the plains,</br>Reject not my poor plaintive lay,</br>But listen to Paridel's strains:</br>Time was when you eagerly strove</br>Who most could my music prolong;</br>When I chaunted sweet sonnets of love,</br>Ye always applauded my song.", "Young Phillis too mix'd with the train,</br>Whilst Corydon clasp'd her dear waist;</br>Heav'n knows how I envy'd the swain</br>The joys of so sweet a repast:</br>To seize her fond heart by surprize</br>My musical pow'rs I'd exert;</br>Expecting a glance from her eyes,</br>To cherish the flame in my heart.", "Oh!  tell me (for ye can declare)</br>How 'tentive she listen'd the while;</br>And when she approv'd of an air,</br>She'd kindly vouchsafe me a smile:</br>Enraptur'd I join'd in the dance;</br>Young Phil seem'd reserved and coy;</br>But I constru'd each trivial glance,</br>As a prelude to rapturous joy.", "When gardens were just in their prime,</br>How ardent I've labour'd the strain,</br>Not doubting but flow'rets and rhime,</br>Some favour with Phillis might gain;</br>Then quickly I'd hie to the bow'r,</br>My well-chosen song to rehearse;</br>And as I selected each flower,</br>Recited its beauties in verse.", "Yet none of them all must compare,</br>Or dare with my charmer to vie;</br>The vi'lets must droop in despair,</br>The woodbines and eglantines die:</br>Her breath I'd compare to the sweets</br>Which pinks in a morning diffuse,</br>And many more pretty conceits</br>Escap'd not my vigilant muse.", "A smile I accepted as praise;</br>(So fond is a swain that's in love)</br>I believe she esteem'd my lays,</br>But could not my person approve:</br>A swain, uninspir'd by the muse,</br>Young Strephon who lives in the vale,</br>Had a person no nymph could refuse,</br>And Phillis &mdash; she heard his fond tale.", "And now it recurs to my mind,</br>(Ah!  wou'd I had ne'er seen the day!)</br>When the lads and the lasses were join'd,</br>And the birds swell'd their notes on the spray:</br>When I too resumed my place,</br>And pip'd while young Phillida sung;</br>The graces all play'd round her face,</br>While her voice did each accent prolong.", "But why do I languish in vain?</br>Young Phillis is deaf to my moan;</br>Why should I forsake the gay plain,</br>And wander these deserts alone?</br>Young Coridon travers'd these shades,</br>Abandon'd to grief and despair,</br>Frequented these fountains and glades,</br>Undone by the frowns of my fair.", "Let me other projects pursue,</br>That soon may fresh vigour impart,</br>My health and complexion renew,</br>And drive sullen grief from my heart:</br>'Tis granted young Phillis had charms,</br>Yet all were to Strephon resign'd;</br>Me Sylvia invites to her arms,</br>I'll fly, and give grief to the wind.</br>"]
