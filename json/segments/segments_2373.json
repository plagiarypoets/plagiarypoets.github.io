["Hail, ancient tow'rs!  long nodding o'er the plain,</br>Whose lofty pile salutes the western sky;</br>Thy stately pride, alas!  is all in vain,</br>No more thy walls the siege of time defy.", "In vain thy greatness claims thy country's care,</br>To noble wealth thou idly dost complain,</br>The murm'ring dome sighs to the empty air,</br>Nor Lord nor Muse awake thy ancient fame.", "Beneath thy roof, in days of former years,</br>The princely guests pass'd round the cheering bowl;</br>Oft hath thy sure retreat suppress'd the fears,</br>Oft quell'd the tumults of the royal soul.", "Alas, no more! &mdash; Where now thy JAMES'S train?</br>Thy DOUGLAS, RANDOLPH?  Where thy Barons bold?</br>For thee fair MARY soon had lost a name,</br>Had not a STUART all her story told.", "Within the halls, where many a banquet pass'd,</br>In echoing domes, where RIZZIO tun'd his strings,</br>The hungry jay devours his rude repast,</br>The lonely turtle coos in plaintive strains.", "No more thy courts sound to the lawyer's tale,</br>Nor busy orators their peals diffuse;</br>The owls, loud howling, now in turn prevail,</br>The noble throng are in the narrow house.", "Thy church no more the gaudy mass beholds,</br>No swelling pomp her sacred roofs resound;</br>Nor ghost shall warn a JAMES from FLODDEN fields,</br>Nor more shall CREIGHTON be to penance bound.</br>"]
