["Smit with a theme, beyond the Aonian lore,</br>Beyond the Roman, or the Grecian fire,</br>The flights of Milton's British genius soar,</br>Where the rapt Seraph tunes his golden lyre,</br>And wakes such strains, as infant Nature heard,</br>When first her atoms glow'd beneath the Omnific Word!", "Borne on the expansion of his wing sublime,</br>He sees the angelic legions rush to war!</br>Sees Michael flaming through the ethereal clime,</br>And Satan towering in his sun-bright car!</br>Sees, in mid heaven, the fiery conflict rise,</br>Permitted to decide the empire of the skies!", "Wide-streaming with celestial glory bright,</br>The advancing Ensign of Messiah flames!</br>He comes, terrific in paternal might!</br>Afar, his coming, power divine proclaims!</br>Wrapp'd in red wrath he shakes the empyreal poles,</br>And dreadful, heard remote, the mustering thunder rolls!</br>"]
