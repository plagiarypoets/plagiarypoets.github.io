["Come, thou indulgent friend to soft Repose,</br>Whether with crimson, green, or yellow lin'd;</br>Come with thy downy lap, and let's embrace,</br>While thus supine I sink into thy arms:</br>When man can't saunter thro' the silent grove,</br>Or, under shade of tufted trees alone</br>Indulge in Solitude his weary hours;</br>When chilling damps, or Winter's nipping frost,</br>Denies access to silent hawthorn bow'rs,</br>Oh grant him Heav'n!  grant him your next best gift,</br>The soft, reclining, gentle, Easy Chair:</br>There if by gambol, or in jocund dance,</br>Or if by skating o'er the frozen stream</br>(Health-breeding Exercise) he chance to tire;</br>There, brisk Activity gives up her sway</br>And yields dominion to all-pow'rful Ease.</br>Hail, smiling Ease!  Philosophy's great pride,</br>Mother of Meditation, and the nurse</br>Of all the tribes in sportive Fancy's train.</br>Without thy care great Newton ne'er had found</br>The Laws of Nature, of discover'd worlds.</br>Hail, cheerful Ruler of the mental pow'rs!</br>Here now accept a Vot'ry at thy shrine,</br>And cheer with smiles a wearied son of Care.</br>"]
