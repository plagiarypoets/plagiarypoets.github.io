["Come, shepherds, let's visit yon grove,</br>And weep as we enter its shade;</br>There lies the dear object of love,</br>There Colin the shepherd is laid:</br>A tribute of sorrow we owe,</br>That tribute of sorrow we'll pay;</br>We'll join the young nymphs in their woe,</br>We lov'd him as dearly as they.", "This morn, as a ramble I took,</br>I mark'd they had gather'd them there,</br>Each mournfully lean'd on her crook,</br>Each water'd his grave with a tear.</br>The spot they industriously drest</br>With flowers, the pride of the plains;</br>They number'd the charms he possest,</br>They call'd him, The sweetest of swains.", "There Hebe, sweet mourner, I saw,</br>Whom Colin would fondly approve;</br>They talk'd of their friendship &mdash; but ah!</br>That friendship had ripen'd to love.</br>Distracted with sorrow she fell,</br>And kissing the grave of the swain,</br>Thrice bade her dear Colin farewell,</br>And weeping return'd to the plain.", "Thy Colin, fair Hebe, was young;</br>By nature as mild as the dove,</br>And the accents that fell from his tongue</br>Were always the accents of love:</br>Accomplish'd in body and mind,</br>He dropt like the rose on the plain;</br>His equal thou never wilt find,</br>Nor look on his fellow again.", "His virtues shall ne'er be forgot;</br>But oft as the new moon appears,</br>We'll haste to the sorrowful spot,</br>And water his grave with our tears.</br>This duty instruction will give,</br>Our virtue with vigour supply,</br>Will teach us like Colin to live,</br>Will teach us like Colin to die.</br>"]
