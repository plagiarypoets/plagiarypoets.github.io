["Now all-chearing May is arriv'd,</br>And daisies adorn ev'ry vale;</br>The heart of the warbler's reviv'd,</br>And lambkins frisk over each dale.</br>But all the gay scenes of the year</br>Nor comfort nor pleasure can give,</br>Since she, who than life was more dear,</br>Has left me in sorrow to live.", "What frenzy has come in her mind,</br>To leave me to wander alone?</br>No solace, alas!  can I find;</br>Oh, where is my PHILLIDA gone!</br>My sheep may now carelessly stray,</br>And seek their poor shepherd in vain,</br>For since the lov'd maid is away,</br>I never will tend them again.", "How joyfully pass'd the lone day!</br>When DAMON thought PHILLIDA kind;</br>No swain was so chearful and gay;</br>&mdash;My heart was as light as the wind.</br>But now I do pensively rove,</br>For chang'd are the days I have seen;</br>The birds now seem dumb in the grove,</br>And the forests no longer are green.", "By the side of yon sweet running rill,</br>With PHILLIDA often I've stray'd;</br>And oft on yon neighb'ring green hill,</br>On my pipe to her sweetly have play'd.</br>But with grief my poor heart is now sore,</br>Like an owl in the desart I mourn;</br>For, alas!  all these pleasures are o'er,</br>And, I doubt, never more will return.", "Ye shepherds!  that hear how I sigh,</br>Take warning, and trust not the fair,</br>They'll leave you to languish and die,</br>When once you are caught in the snare:</br>Ye hills and ye vallies, adieu!</br>Where often I've tended my sheep;</br>Since PHILLIDA'S false and untrue,</br>Poor DAMON for ever shall weep.</br>"]
