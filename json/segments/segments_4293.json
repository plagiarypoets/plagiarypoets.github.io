["The wilder'd luxuriance of thorn,</br>With tendrils of woodbine I blend;</br>Late ev'ning, or dew-spangled morn,</br>The task I with pleasure attend;</br>Here dressing, my Delia, for thee</br>This arbour, deep hid in the grove;</br>Come, charmer, and visit with me,</br>The peaceable mansions of Love.", "How often, from walking the dale,</br>I fly for a silent recess;</br>And to song give my dolorous tale</br>Of Love, and its tender excess:</br>Or, pensive, I ramble the brake,</br>From all my companions apart;</br>Whilst, fair as yon swan of the lake,</br>My Delia prevails in my heart.", "My thought ever dwells on thy form,</br>And my heart lives in constant alarms;</br>'Tis toss'd, like a wave in the storm,</br>When Delia flies far from my arms.</br>Thou, for whom all my songs are in tune,</br>New songs where thy beauties I trace;</br>In smiles, like the mornings of June,</br>Return to thy Colin's embrace.", "White clover besprinkles the plain;</br>In thickets wild roses abound;</br>The birds in a musical vein</br>Sing sweet in full chorus around.</br>Far flown is the Winter's cold hour;</br>'Tis Summer &mdash; all charming and gay;&mdash;</br>We safely may sit in the bow'r,</br>And love the sweet moments away.</br>"]
