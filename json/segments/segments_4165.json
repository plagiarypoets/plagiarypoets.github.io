["Hail!  ye bright waves, that fair Cytherea lave,</br>From whence, in pomp of youth and loveliness,</br>With fragrant roses crown'd,</br>Thou, heavenly goddess, rose;", "Thine hallow'd birth, in strains melodious,</br>Tritons, on argent pinions, hov'ring sung,</br>Smooth as the lay which floats</br>From lone Pierian shades;", "When, high enthron'd upon the eternal skies,</br>Night's gentle regent her effulgence pales,</br>While 'neath embow'ring groves,</br>Thy tender vot'ries roam.", "By thee encharm'd, the rash adventurous youth,</br>With martial ardor, flies to fields where Fame,</br>'Mid shadowing trophies, speeds</br>Her blood-fraught dire career,", "Yet not for thee, oh Fame!  his bosom burns,</br>Nor for the garland honors of thy brow,</br>Nor all the gay parade</br>Thy favour'd followers prize:", "But love, delightful love, invites him on,&mdash;</br>A softer flame his throbbing heart pervades;</br>And thine extatic smile,</br>A war's fatigue repays;", "The simple carle, who from his plains ne'er stray'd,</br>Oft' times reclines beside the brawling brook,</br>And in the silent hour</br>Hymns his desires to thee.", "While Hesper laves in dew his pearly light,</br>And musk, borne on wings of gossamer,</br>In sweet impassion'd notes,</br>Entrance his list'ning ear;", "Oh bliss supreme's his lot with her to dwell,</br>Whose virtuous mind, whose unaffected grace,</br>Adorns life's checquer'd scenes,</br>And turns its tears to smiles.", "Enchanting power!  oh grant my early song,</br>Thy warbling voice, thy softly thrilling sway,</br>To win the nymph I love,</br>Thy liquid numbers give.", "And when the morn, from amaranthine couch,</br>O'er the horizon sheds her vermeil light,</br>Again the Muse shall raise</br>Her orisons to thee.</br>"]
