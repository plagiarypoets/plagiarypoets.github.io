["Again, lovely Maia, fair daughter of Spring!</br>Revisit the isle where the Muses resort;</br>The milkmaid and ploughman delightfully sing,</br>Nor envy the sycophants cringing at court.", "See how the pale primroses chequer the ground,</br>While myriads of daisies promiscuously blow;</br>The cowslips now shed their sweet odours around,</br>Or bloom 'neath the hedge where the hazel-trees grow.", "There's nought in the garden, tho' cultur'd with care,</br>Can with these in the charms of simplicity vie;</br>The fam'd polyanthus may flaunt it in air,</br>And let the auricula pleasure the eye;", "The dark-purpled vi'let more charms can dispense,</br>Whilst blended luxuriant the clover among;</br>Shall bloom thro' the season and ravish the sense,</br>When the garden's frail flow'rets shall live but in song.", "All nature seems jocund, the birds on each spray</br>In kind emulation now lengthen their notes;</br>The blackbird pours out his mellifluous lay,</br>While the lark and the linnet are straining their throats.", "O!  hail lovely Maia!  that lead'st the young hours,</br>To sport in the shades, and real'st them with song;</br>Meantime shall the Naiads embellish thy bowers,</br>Till Juno, bright goddess!  brings summer along.</br>"]
