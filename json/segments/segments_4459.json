["Hell is the region where I first drew breath;</br>Sin is my victim, and my sport is death.</br>To vex the tenants of this earthly ball</br>I issued forth, exulting, at the fall;</br>Tortur'd by me, the miscreant eyes the past</br>With rage, and feels no ray of hope at last.</br>I scorn the calm that pure repentance brings,</br>And arm the conscience with immortal stings;</br>Round the lorn wretch a thousand forms of dread</br>Hover all day, and haunt at night his bed.</br>Swift at my call a host of fiends appear:</br>Hark!  how they bellow in the troubled air!</br>Appal'd, amaz'd, the wretch infuriate glares,</br>And wildly on the horrid prospect stares:</br>His former deeds, alas!  of murky hue,</br>Arise, in dread array, before his view;&mdash;</br>His brain grows giddy, he invokes despair!</br>I come:  I seize him by his flowing hair;</br>And, as convuls'd his madd'ning eye-balls roll,</br>Present the dagger, or the poison'd bowl.</br>"]
