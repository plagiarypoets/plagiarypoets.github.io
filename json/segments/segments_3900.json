["When the trees are all bare, not a leaf to be seen,</br>And the meadows their beauty have lost;</br>When nature's disrob'd of her mantle of green,</br>And the streams are fast bound with the frost,", "While the peasant inactive stands shivering with cold,</br>As bleak the winds northerly blow;</br>And the innocent flocks run for ease to the fold,</br>With their fleeces besprinkled with snow,", "In the yard, when the cattle are fodder'd with straw,</br>And they send forth their breath like a steam:</br>And the neat-looking dairy maid sees she must thaw</br>Flakes of ice that she finds in the cream,", "When the lads and the lasses for company joyn'd,</br>In a croud round the embers are met;</br>Talk of fairies and witches that ride on the wind,</br>And of ghosts, till they're all in a sweat,", "Heav'n grant in this season it may be my lot,</br>With the nymph whom I love and admire;</br>While the icicles hang from the eves of my cot,</br>I may thither in safety retire!", "Where in neatness and quiet &mdash; and free from surprize</br>We may live and no hardships endure;</br>Nor feel any turbulent passions arise,</br>But such as each other may cure.</br>"]
