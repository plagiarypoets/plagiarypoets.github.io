["O thou!  for whom wise Socrates did die,</br>And Plato seek by Reason's feeble aid,</br>Descend, dear Angel!  from the shining sky,</br>In Revelation's glorious light array'd;</br>With thy propitious smiles disperse the night,</br>That, like chaotic gloom, o'erwhelms my mental sight.", "Lo!  beauteous Virtue!  Vice, in fair disguise,</br>Leads thousands, o'er her flow'ry paths, astray.</br>Remove, remove, from their deluded eyes,</br>The film of Sin, and shew thy heav'nly day;</br>Then Pleasure's seeming charms shall please no more&mdash;</br>Inform'd by thee, the soul shall Nature's GOD adore.", "Depriv'd of thee, the bloom of Beauty fades,</br>And haggard Vice despoils each living grace;</br>A settled gloom the lovely face o'ershades&mdash;</br>Disease and Guilt the fairest hues deface:</br>'Tis thou alone can'st real worth bestow</br>On Woman's beauties here, and shield her breast from woe.", "The Man who lives with passions unrestrain'd,</br>Finds Disappointment mar his promis'd joy;</br>With Sensuality his bosom stain'd,</br>Feels fierce Remorse his sober hours annoy.</br>Ah!  wretched being!  break vile Folly's chain&mdash;</br>In Virtue's peaceful path, lost happiness regain.", "Society, fair Virtue!  bless'd with thee,</br>Improves its knowledge, and each useful art;</br>The mind expands with native energy,</br>Where thy creative smiles new light impart:</br>Thy boundless pow'r invigorates the whole,</br>Of social happiness, the animating soul.", "O!  come, and o'er mankind thy reign extend,</br>To Rectitude and Peace the nations guide;</br>With useful knowledge ev'ry land befriend,</br>And save the human race from sinful pride&mdash;</br>Pride, thy worst foe, where thou presidest, dies,</br>And meek Humility guides to eternal joys.</br>"]
