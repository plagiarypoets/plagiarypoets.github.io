["INVECTIVE AGAINST METAPHYSICIANS, AND SELF-CONGRATULATION OF THE POET.</br>Ye quibbling sages, fam'd in Gothic cells,</br>From your perplexing tracks and endless maze</br>The Muse, deliver'd, seeks the flow'ry dells,</br>And cheerful carols lovely Nature's praise.</br>Full sweet and pleasant are her summer-lays.</br>But had she wont with you, still blank and dull,</br>In worthless labour had she past her days,</br>With fabling lore to cheat Devotion's gull,</br>Obscure, nor then as now of blooming honors full,", "Then had our skeptics held their cause secure,</br>And counted wit and truth alike their own:</br>Nor Hume had shrunk, unable to endure</br>The smarting lashes on his shoulders thrown.", "COLLOQUIAL TRIUMPHS.</br>I triumph in the ill-dissembled groan,</br>When Wit perplex'd with puzzled fingers drums;</br>And hold the victory proclaim'd my own,</br>When beau confounded ends of op'ras hums,</br>Or from the straining chest hard-hawk'd up laughter comes.", "PANEGYRIC OF DR. J&mdash;N.</br>But stop, my muse; make ready with thy tears;</br>For mighty J&mdash;n pour the plaintive song,</br>Whose fame shall sound while Time preserves his ears.</br>He charg'd, like me, the Sceptic Powers among!</br>While all his virtues to my mem'ry throng,</br>My bitter soul all comfort does refuse!</br>And now I hear the ev'ning's solemn gong,</br>Home must I hie to shun the chilling dews;</br>But as I go I'll mourn &mdash; O weep apace, my Muse!</br>"]
