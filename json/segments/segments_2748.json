["Uncouth Hag of evening hour,</br>Wait around this ivy bower;</br>And whilst owls and bats do cry,</br>And foretel Man's destiny,</br>do thou, Despair, still haunt my tortur'd breast,</br>Nor grant its master one short hour of rest.", "Come, come, I call &mdash; my footsteps guide</br>To the river's margent side&mdash;</br>There despondence rush me in.</br>Fatal Fury, urge thy course</br>As the swift and speedy horse,</br>And bid my woe begin.&mdash;</br>Hark, I hear Religion say,</br>\"Guide thy steps another way;</br>Patience shall accomplish all</br>For which thy soul can ever call:</br>Wait at my resplendent lamp betimes,</br>And bid defiance to a race of crimes.\"", "Avaunt, foul fiend; I cannot bear</br>Thy curst alluring voice to hear.</br>Despair, avaunt; I bid thee hence,</br>And vow a life of penitence;</br>The Gods have seen me on the verge of fate,</br>And snatch'd me from destruction ere too late.", "Retract, retract, thy impious call,</br>Nor e'er again my heart enthrall,</br>But let me shun thy power.</br>How can the virtuous ever bear</br>To taste of thee, uncouth Despair,</br>Whom grief attends each hour!", "Henceforth, Despair, I bid adieu</br>To all who ever trust in you;</br>Kind meek Religion be my guide,</br>Whose patient path is open wide;</br>Whose dictates tell thy fatal craft is vain,</br>Whose records charge thee with a field of slain.</br>"]
