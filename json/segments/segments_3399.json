["Beautiful gem, upon the brow</br>The hoary brow of ancient night,&mdash;</br>Beautiful gem, that tremblest now,</br>Mild and pure with thy tranquil light;</br>Ever holy and ever bright,</br>Shine forever, beautiful star!</br>Blissful promise and sweet delight</br>Shower still from thy golden car,</br>When the hushed winds are still, as now they are.", "Beautiful gem, in the glorious crown</br>Of heaven purest and holiest;&mdash;</br>Beautiful star, that pourest down</br>All things sweetest and all things best,&mdash;</br>Now thou bringest the weary rest;&mdash;</br>Care and trouble and toil retreat;&mdash;</br>Bringest the bird to his downy nest,&mdash;</br>Bringest the youth to his loved one's feet,&mdash;</br>And bright smiles to the home where child and mother meet.</br>"]
