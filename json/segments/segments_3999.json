["Haste, shepherds, from every vale,</br>And listen around while I sing;</br>Be silent ye birds of the dale,</br>For Peggy is sweeter than spring.</br>All you who my fair one have seen</br>Must own to the truth of my song,</br>That none is so fair in the green,</br>Or dances the meadows along.", "\"He's faithful, no doubt,\" wou'd she say,</br>\"His lambkins at distance to leave,</br>His sheep unattended, a prey,</br>With innocence only to save.</br>Then what cou'd I hope or expect,</br>From a shepherd so fickle as he?</br>For one that his lambkins neglect,</br>Would never prove constant to me.\"", "Then let me haste backward with speed,</br>And lead my flock over the lawn,</br>That sportingly skip to my reed,</br>Which I tune up the coming of dawn.</br>Ah, Peggy!  delightfully fair,</br>Believe my fond vows to be true,</br>My flock shall alone be my care,</br>My love shall be constant to you.</br>"]
