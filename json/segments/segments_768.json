["Stately the feast, and high the cheer,</br>When girt with many an armed peer,</br>CILGARRAN, in thy castle hall,</br>O'ercanopied with golden pall,</br>Sublime, in formidable state,</br>And warlike splendour, Henry sate;</br>Prepar'd to stain the briny flood</br>Of Shannon's lakes with rebel blood.", "Illumining the vaulted roof,</br>A thousand torches flam'd aloof:</br>From massy cups, with golden gleam</br>Sparkled the red metheglin's stream:</br>To grace the gorgeous festival,</br>Along the lofty-window'd hall,</br>The storied tapestry was hung:</br>With minstrelsy the rafters rung</br>Of harps, that with reflected light</br>From the proud gallery glitter'd bright:</br>While gifted bards, a rival throng,</br>(From distant Mona, nurse of song,</br>From Teivi, fring'd with umbrage brown,</br>From Elwy's vale, and Cader's crown,</br>From many a shaggy precipice</br>That shades Ierne's hoarse abyss,</br>And many a sunless solitude</br>Of Radnor's inmost mountains rude,)</br>To crown the banquet's solemn close,</br>Themes of British glory chose;</br>And to the strings of various chime</br>Attemper'd thus the fabling rime.", "\"O'er Cornwall's cliffs the tempest roar'd,</br>High the screaming sea-mew soar'd;</br>On Tintaggel's topmost tower</br>Darksom fell the sleety shower;</br>Round the rough castle shrilly sung</br>The whirling blast, and wildly flung</br>On each tall rampart's thundering side</br>The surges of the tumbling tide:</br>When Arthur rang'd his red-cross ranks</br>On conscious Camlan's crimson'd banks:</br>By Mordred's faithless guile decreed</br>Beneath a Saxon spear to bleed!</br>Yet in vain a paynim foe</br>Arm'd with fate the mighty blow;</br>For when he fell, an elfin queen,</br>All in secret, and unseen,</br>O'er the fainting hero threw</br>Her mantle of ambrosial blue;</br>And bade her spirits bear him far,</br>In Merlin's agate-axled car,</br>To her green isle's enamel'd steep,</br>Far in the navel of the deep.</br>O'er his wounds she sprinkled dew</br>From flowers that in Arabia grew:</br>On a rich, inchanted bed</br>She pillow'd his majestic head;</br>O'er his brow, with whispers bland,</br>Thrice she wav'd an opiate wand;</br>And, to soft music's airy sound,</br>Her magic curtains clos'd around.</br>There, renew'd the vital spring,</br>Again he reigns a mighty king;</br>And many a fair and fragrant clime,</br>Blooming in immortal prime,</br>By gales of Eden ever fann'd,</br>Owns the monarch's high command:</br>Thence to Britain shall return,</br>(If right prophetic rolls I learn)</br>Borne on Victory's spreading plume,</br>His antient sceptre to resume;</br>Once more, in old heroic pride,</br>His barbed courser to bestride;</br>His knightly table to restore,</br>And brave the tournaments of yore.\"", "They ceas'd:  when on the tuneful stage</br>Advanc'd a bard, of aspect sage;</br>His silver tresses, thin besprent,</br>To age a graceful reverence lent;</br>His beard, all white as spangles frore</br>That clothe Plinlimmon's forests hoar,</br>Down to his harp descending flow'd;</br>With Time's faint rose his features glow'd;</br>His eyes diffus'd a soften'd fire,</br>And thus he wak'd the warbling wire.", "\"Listen, Henry, to my read!</br>Not from fairy realms I lead</br>Bright-rob'd Tradition, to relate</br>In forged colours Arthur's fate;</br>Tho' much of old romantic lore</br>On the blest theme I keep in store:</br>But boastful Fiction should be dumb,</br>Where Truth the strain might best become.</br>If thine ear may still be won</br>With songs of Uther's glorious son;</br>Henry, I a tale unfold,</br>Never yet in rime enroll'd,</br>Nor sung nor harp'd in hall or bower;</br>Which, in my youth's full early flower,</br>A minstrel, sprung of Cornish line,</br>Who spoke of kings from old Locrine,</br>Taught me to chant, one vernal dawn,</br>Deep in a cliff-encircled lawn,</br>What time the glistening vapours fled</br>From cloud-envelop'd Clyder's head;</br>And on its sides the torrents gray</br>Shone to the morning's orient ray.", "\"When Arthur bow'd his haughty crest,</br>No princess, veil'd in azure vest,</br>Snatch'd him, by Merlin's potent spell,</br>In groves of golden bliss to dwell;</br>Where, crown'd with wreaths of misletoe,</br>Slaughter'd kings in glory go:</br>But when he fell, with winged speed,</br>His champions, on a milk-white steed,</br>From the battle's hurricane,</br>Bore him to Joseph's towered fane,</br>In the fair vale of Avalon:</br>There, with chaunted orison,</br>And the long blaze of tapers clear,</br>The stoled fathers met the bier:</br>Through the dim iles, in order dread</br>Of martial woe, the chief they led,</br>And deep intomb'd in holy ground,</br>Before the altar's solemn bound.</br>Around no dusky banners wave,</br>No mouldering trophies mark the grave:</br>Away the ruthless Dane has torn</br>Each trace that Time's slow touch had worn;</br>And long, o'er the neglected stone,</br>Oblivion's veil its shade has thrown:</br>The faded tomb, with honour due,</br>'Tis thine, O Henry, to renew!</br>Thither, when Conquest has restor'd</br>Yon recreant isle, and sheath'd the sword,</br>When Peace with palm has crown'd thy brows,</br>Haste thee, to pay thy pilgrim vows.</br>There, observant of my lore,</br>The pavement's hallow'd depth explore;</br>And thrice a fathom underneath</br>Dive into the vaults of death.</br>There shall thine eye, with wild amaze,</br>On his gigantic stature gaze;</br>There shalt thou find the monarch laid,</br>All in warrior-weeds array'd;</br>Wearing in death his helmet-crown,</br>And weapons huge of old renown.</br>Martial prince, 'tis thine to save</br>From dark oblivion Arthur's grave!</br>So may thy ships securely stem</br>The western frith:  thy diadem</br>Shine victorious in the van,</br>Nor heed the slings of Ulster's clan:</br>Thy Norman pike-men win their way</br>Up the dun rocks of Harald's bay:</br>And from the steeps of rough Kildare</br>Thy prancing hoofs the falcon scare:</br>So may thy bow's unerring yew</br>Its shafts in Roderick's heart embrew.\"", "Amid the pealing symphony</br>The spiced goblets mantled high;</br>With passions new the song impress'd</br>The listening king's impatient breast:</br>Flash the keen lightnings from his eyes;</br>He scorns awhile his bold emprise;</br>E'en now he seems, with eager pace,</br>The consecrated floor to trace,</br>And ope, from its tremendous gloom,</br>The treasure of the wonderous tomb:</br>E'en now, he burns in thought to rear,</br>From its dark bed, the ponderous spear,</br>Rough with the gore of Pictish kings:</br>E'en now fond hope his fancy wings,</br>To poise the monarch's massy blade,</br>Of magic-temper'd metal made;</br>And drag to day the dinted shield</br>That felt the storm of Camlan's field.</br>O'er the sepulchre profound</br>E'en now, with arching sculpture crown'd,</br>He plans the chauntry's choral shrine,</br>The daily dirge, and rites divine.</br>"]
