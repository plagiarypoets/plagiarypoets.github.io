["Let not the Young my Precepts shun,</br>One Vision more, and I have done;</br>Your Poet sung of Love's Delights,</br>Of Halcyon Days and joyous Nights;</br>To the gay Fancy lovely Themes;</br>And fain, I'd hope, they're more than Dreams.</br>But, if you please, before we part,</br>I'd speak a Language to your Heart.</br>We'll talk of LIFE, tho' much, I fear,</br>Th' ungrateful Tale will wound your Ear.</br>You raise your sanguine Thoughts too high,</br>And hardly know the Reason why:</br>But say, Life's Tree bears golden Fruit,</br>Some Canker shall corrode the Root;</br>Some unexpected Storm shall rise;</br>Or scorching Suns, or chilling Skies;</br>And (if experienc'd Truths avail)</br>All your autumnal Hopes shall fail.", "Perhaps you'll think I act the same,</br>As a sly Sharper plays his Game:</br>You triumph every Deal that's past,</br>He's sure to triumph at the last,</br>Who coins, perhaps, some Thousands more</br>Than twice the Sums you won before.</br>But I'm a Loser with the rest;</br>For Life is all a Deal at best:</br>I play the Cards alike with you,</br>My Hand is bad, by Trumps are few;</br>Nor am I Gainer by your Fall;</br>For Sorrows are the Lot of all.", "'Tis Truth (receive it ill or well)</br>'Tis melancholy Truth I tell.</br>Why should the Preacher take your Pence,</br>And smother Truth to flatter Sense?</br>I'm sure, Physicians have no Merit,</br>Who kill, thro' Lenity of Spirit.", "That Life's a Game, Divines confess,</br>This says at Cards, and That at Chess:</br>But if our Views be center'd here,</br>'Tis all a losing Game I fear.", "Sailors, you know, when Wars obtain,</br>And hostile Vessels croud the Main,</br>If they discover from afar</br>A bark as distant as a Star,</br>Hold the Perspectives to their Eyes,</br>To learn its Colours, Strength and Size;</br>And when this Secret once they know,</br>Make ready to receive the Foe.</br>Let you and I from Sailors learn</br>Important Truths of like Concern.", "I clos'd the Day, as Custom led,</br>With Reading, till the Time of Bed;</br>Where Fancy, at the Midnight Hour,</br>Again display'd her magic Pow'r.</br>(For know, that Fancy, like a Spright,</br>Prefers the silent Scenes of Night.)</br>She lodg'd me in a neighb'ring Wood,</br>No matter where the Thicket stood;</br>The GENIUS of the Place was nigh,</br>And held two Pictures to my Eye.</br>The curious Painter had portray'd</br>LIFE in each just and genuine Shade.</br>They, who have only known its Dawn,</br>May think these Lines too deeply drawn;</br>But riper Years, I fear, will shew,</br>The wiser Artist paints too true.", "One Piece presents a rueful Wild,</br>Where not a Summer's Sun had smil'd;</br>The Road with Thorns is cover'd wide,</br>And GRIEF sits weeping by the Side;</br>Her Tears with constant Tenor flow,</br>And form a mournful Lake below;</br>Whose silent Waters, dark and deep,</br>Thro' all the gloomy Valley creep.", "Passions, that flatter, or that slay,</br>Are Beasts that fawn, or Birds that prey.</br>Here VICE assumes the Serpent's Shape;</br>There FOLLY personates the Ape;</br>Here AV'RICE gripes with Tygers' Jaws;</br>While Sons of Mischief, ART and GUILE,</br>Are Alligators of the Nile.", "Ev'n PLEASURE acts a treach'rous Part,</br>She charms the Sense, but stings the Heart.</br>And when she gulls us of our Wealth,</br>Or that superior Pearl, our Health;</br>Restores us nought, but Pains and Woe,</br>And drowns us in the LAKE below.", "There a commission'd ANGEL stands,</br>With Desolation in his Hands!</br>He sends the all-devouring Flame,</br>And Cities hardly boast a Name.</br>Or wings the pestilential Blast,</br>And lo!  ten thousands breathe their last.</br>He speaks &mdash; obedient Tempests roar,</br>And guilty Nations are no more:</br>He speaks &mdash; the Fury DISCORD raves,</br>And sweeps whole Armies to their Graves:</br>Or FAMINE lifts her mildew'd Hand,</br>And HUNGER howls thro' all the Land.", "Oh!  what a Wretch is Man, I cry'd,</br>Expos'd to Death on every Side!</br>By Evils, which He cannot shun!</br>Without a thousand Baits to Sin,</br>A thousand Traytors lodg'd within!</br>For soon as Vice assaults the Heart,</br>These Rebels take the Daemon's Part.", "I sigh, my aching Bosom bleeds;</br>When strait a milder Plan succeeds.</br>The briny Lake, the dreary Shore,</br>The same as in the Piece before,</br>But Gleams of Light are here display'd,</br>To chear the Eye, and gild the Shade.</br>AFFLICTION speaks a softer Stile,</br>And DISAPPOINTMENT wears a Smile.</br>Each thriving Virtue blossoms near,</br>Their Roots improve by every Tear.", "Here PATIENCE, gentle Maid!  is nigh,</br>To calm the Storm, and wipe the Eye:</br>HOPE acts the kind Physician's Part,</br>And warms the solitary Heart;</br>RELIGION nobler Comforts brings,</br>Disarms our Griefs, or blunts their Stings;</br>Points out the Ballance on the Whole,</br>And HEAV'N rewards the struggling Soul.", "But while these Raptures I pursue,</br>The GENIUS suddenly withdrew.</br>"]
