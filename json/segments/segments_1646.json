["Father of Earth and Heaven!  I call thy name;</br>Round me the smoke and shout of battle roll,</br>My eyes are dazzled with the rustling flame.</br>Father!  sustain an untried Soldier's soul!</br>Or life, or death, whatever be the goal</br>That crowns or closes round this struggling hour</br>Thou know'st, if ever from my spirit stole</br>One deeper pray'r, 'twas that no cloud might low'r</br>On my young fame, O, hear!  God of Eternal Pow'r,", "God!  thou art merciful!  the wintry storm,</br>The cloud that pours the thunders from its womb,</br>But shew the sterner grandeur of thy form:</br>The lightnings, glancing thro' the midnight gloom,</br>To Faith's rais'd eye as calm, as lovely come</br>As splendours of the autumnal Evening's Star,</br>As roses shaken by the breezes plume,</br>When like cool incense combs the dewy air,</br>And on the golden wave, the sunset flames afar.", "GOD!  thou art mighty!  at thy footstool bound,</br>Lie prostrate, Chance and Fate, and Life and Death!</br>Nor in the Angel circle flaming round,</br>Nor in the million worlds that sweep beneath,</br>Is one that can withstand thy wrath's hot breath!</br>Woe in thy frown!  in thy smile Victory!</br>Hear but my prayer!  I ask no mortal wreath;</br>Let but these eyes my rescued country see,</br>Then take my spirit all, Omnipotent, to thee!", "Now, for the fight &mdash; now, for the cannon peal!</br>All round me blood and toil and cloud and fire;</br>Glorious the shout, the shock, the crash of steel,</br>The musket roll, the rockets' blasting spire;</br>They shake, like broken waves their squares retire.</br>Hussars!  now, slack the rein, now give the heel,</br>Think of the insulted wife, the murder'd sire,</br>On, comrades, on; in thunder on them wheel;</br>This hour to Europe's fate shall set the triumph-seal.</br>"]
