["Ye Grottoes, who hear me complain</br>Say, whence has the madness arose,</br>That my breast must for ever retain</br>What only destroys my repose?</br>That thus to your tenantless shade</br>Her fatal idea I bear,</br>And distractedly doat on the maid,</br>Who has doom'd me for life to despair.", "O Reason!  presumptuously vain,</br>How idly dost thou disapprove;</br>And affect to look down on a pain,</br>Which thou never canst hope to remove:</br>Can Reason extinguish the fire,</br>Which those nameless sensations impart,</br>Or Wisdom subdue the desire,</br>Which Nature has stampt on my heart.", "But yet must thou foolishly blame,</br>For Amanda will never incline,</br>Nor her bosom partake of the flame,</br>Which her beauty has kindled in mine;</br>Fate only a refuge can find</br>From the tortures to which I am drove,</br>For the arrow of Death is more kind</br>Than the dart of unpitying Love.</br>"]
