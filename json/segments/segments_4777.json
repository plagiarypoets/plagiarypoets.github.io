["In yonder cave where bloated lizards crawl,</br>And slimy snails hang matted on the wall;</br>Where chilling damp in humid clusters weeps,</br>And rankling ivy o'er the arches creeps;</br>Where screaming owls and night's black ravens sit,</br>And cloister'd bats around the ruins flit;</br>Where gliding phantoms hold their mystick spell,</br>And mumbling witches chaunt their midnight yell,&mdash;</br>Immur'd forlorn amid the mould'ring cells,</br>The pallid victim of distraction dwells.</br>Each with'ring look and furious eyeball's glow</br>Mark the deep traces of consuming woe.</br>Lo!  the sunk cheek, the ghastly face, behold!</br>View the sad remnants of the fairest mould.</br>Those clotted locks that hang disorder'd round,</br>In circling curls his manly temples bound;</br>In him united once the graces shone,</br>And expectation mark'd him for her own.&mdash;</br>Soon travel, want, and cold neglect and care,</br>Penance and pain, disease and fierce despair,</br>In dread succession follow'd close behind,</br>Nor left one vestige of the former mind!</br>'Twas thus her snare alluring Beauty spread,</br>And wove her garlands round his captive head.</br>Perfumed groves her honey paths unfold,</br>With spring's fresh blossoms and with autumn's gold;</br>Love's liquid strains responsive stole along,</br>In fainting cadence breath'd the mellow song;</br>\"Ah!  cruel youth,\" they said, or seemed to say,</br>\"Unheeding thus, why pass my roseate way;</br>Why silent thus neglect my secret bow'rs</br>My cooling grottos and my fragrant flow'rs,</br>My nodding orchards and my nectar rills,</br>My crystal fountains and my fruitful hills?</br>Ah cruel youth!  restrain thy thoughtless haste,</br>Yet deign one sip from amber rills to taste;</br>Yet deign one primrose from my shade to take,</br>'Tis beauty asks, and 'tis for Beauty's sake!\"&mdash;</br>Th' enchantress ceasing, wav'd her golden hair,</br>Ten thousand odours caught the yielding air.</br>As thro' the glades the soft-ton'd murmur flow'd,</br>Each floweret open'd and each blossom glow'd.&mdash;</br>The dulcet notes on spicy pinions glide,</br>Now lure the captive, and now seem to chide;</br>Now check his steps, but checking reinspire,</br>And, adding fuel, feed each latent fire.&mdash;</br>Thus currents, pented by some sudden stay,</br>Confine their waters, and impede their way;</br>But, scope regaining, rush with double force,</br>Receive fresh ardour and impel their course.&mdash;</br>O, when the slave is thoughtless led in charms,</br>In silken chains is bound in Beauty's arms;</br>Adown the hill of fond delusion led,</br>On roses sleeping and on fragrance fed;</br>Like insects sporting in the summer's ray,</br>In dreams of rapture melt the scene away:&mdash;</br>Here step by step in devious mazes tost,</br>His honour sullied and his virtue lost!</br>Crime after crime await the prostrate soul,</br>'Till one great mischief swallows up the whole!&mdash;</br>O Lyre awake!  and thrill my dying verse,</br>Portray each horror and each flight rehearse!</br>Unfold the visions of the frantick mind,</br>Ride the dark wave and mount the viewless wind!</br>Speed through the storm where angry breakers rise,</br>And arrowy tempests flame the wrathful skies.&mdash;</br>Led by thy touch, transport from glooms of night,</br>To lands of magick and to realms of light;</br>Where spring congenial crowns the verdant clime,</br>And smiles exalting in eternal prime.&mdash;</br>Oft when the fiend the maniack spirit wakes,</br>And on the slumbers of its vision breaks;</br>Aghast and wild along the desart raves,</br>The thunder threatens and the conflict braves.</br>Courts the bleak beach where howling tempests roar,</br>And foaming billows lash the sounding shore.</br>The struggling pris'ner, lost in eddying maze,</br>Now thrills in ice, now melts in liquid blaze;</br>Now mounts the air, now dives the craggy steep,</br>And flits the regions of the gloomy deep.</br>Here holds strange converse in the realms below,</br>And greets each shadow as it passes thro'.&mdash;</br>On the swift wings of transient visions led,</br>Alternate phantoms to his fancy spread;</br>Now thro' the paths of flow'ry groves he strays,</br>Each nymph attendant on his footsteps plays;</br>Nectarious streams redundant flow along,</br>And chorals chaunt him with their tender song.</br>Soft on the ear the melting warble floats,</br>The lutes responsive catch the magick notes.</br>The wondrous sounds like David's harp of old</br>Purge the black fiend and break his mystick hold.</br>Thro' fancy's eye aray'd in varied charms,</br>Luxuriant Beauty spreads her silken arms.</br>Unrival'd here, transporting graces bloom,</br>And nature op'ning breathes her fresh perfume:</br>Rich clust'ring vines mid autumn's golden bow'rs,</br>Unite their juices with the woobine flow'rs,</br>Hills, woods, and plains in joyous union ring,</br>And glow extatick in unceasing spring!</br>To pluck the sweets with longing hand he tries,</br>But ah!
