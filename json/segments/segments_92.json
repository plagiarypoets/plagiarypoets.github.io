Joves high Court</br>Is 'gainst this day new starr'd (as some report)</br>With stones and gems, and all the Gods attired</br>In there best pompe to make this day admired.</br>The Seasons have prefer'd the youthfull Spring</br>To be at this high states solemnizing:</br>Who lest he should be wanting at that day</br>Brings Februarie in, attyred like May,</br>And hath for hast to shew his glorious prime</br>Stept or'e two moneths, and come before his time:</br>And that's the cause, no strange preposterous thing,</br>That we this yeare have such a forward Spring.</br>The Summer now is busied with her seed</br>Which quickning in the Earth begins to breed;</br>And being sickish cannot well be spar'd.</br>Autumne in beggers rags attired, not dar'd</br>Intrude into so brave a pompous traine.</br>Old Winter clad in high furres, showers of raine</br>Appearing in his eyes, who still doth goe</br>In a rug gowne ashied with flakes of snow,</br>Shivering with cold, at whose long dangling beard</br>Hangs Isickles, with hoarie frosts made hard,</br>Dares not approach, nor in that Center move,</br>Where lives so sweet a Summer of warme love.</br>Therefore by Janus double face he's past</br>Retyring by December, speeding fast</br>Backward, with more then common aged speed,</br>Most willing that the fresh Spring should succeed</br>With chearefull lookes, and his greene dangling haire,</br>Winters most wastefull Ruines to repaire.</br>But oh leane Lent, why should thy pale lancke cheekes</br>Threaten a suddaine dearth for seven spare weekes</br>After this surplusage; but that the God,</br>That swayes the Ocean with his three-tin'd rod,</br>Would feast these Nuptials with his various cheere,</br>And nothing thinke, that the Sea holds, too deere?</br>Because that as the Heavens gave free assent,</br>With th' Earth to fill these Bridals with content,</br>Even so the Seas their bounties would afford</br>With seasonable Cates to Crowne their bord.</br>Bacchus hath cut his most delicious Vine,</br>And sent it through his swiftest River Rhine,</br>Least to these Bridals it might come too late,</br>Which Brittaine with such joy doth celebrate.</br>What Plannet, Starre, Fate, Influence, or Spheere,</br>But in their operative powers hold deere</br>These faire Espousals?  Is there vertue, grace,</br>Or any goodnesse, but doth claime chiefe place</br>In these great triumphs?  Can the Heavens afford</br>Blessings that doe not Crowne this bridall bord?</br>Can man devise, or of the Gods importune</br>A choice selected good, or speciall fortune,</br>Which heer's not frequent?  'mongst the Saints divine,</br>Be ever henceforth crown'd Saint Valentine.</br>Of all thy hallowings, let not this be least,</br>That thy Saints day is honour'd with this feast.</br>Thou hast the favour to lead in the Spring,</br>And to thy feastive Eve, the birds first sing,</br>With joy that Winter doth the Earth forsake:</br>Upon this day, they each one chuse his make.</br>Couple in paires, and first begin t' inquire</br>Where they may pearch, to quench the raging fire</br>Of their hot loves, where they may safely build</br>And from the bitter stormes their yong ones shield,</br>Untill there naked bodies be ful plum'd,</br>And that with their fledgd wings they have assumed</br>Courage and strength, that when the season's faire</br>They with their careful Dams may prove the Ayre.</br>Learne everie of you a new Nuptiall Lay</br>To Solemnize the triumphs of this day:</br>Your mourneful straines to sadder fates assigne.</br>Now with glad notes salute Saint Valentine.</br>For in this sacred, and melodious quire,</br>The Angels will beare part, tis their desire</br>To have this combination shrild so hie</br>That Heaven may Eccho with the melodie.</br>And now me thinks, I from a Cherubs tongue</br>Heare this applausive Hymne most sweetly sung.</br>"]
