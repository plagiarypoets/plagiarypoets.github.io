vehemence.", "But, when his fury felt the couched spear,</br>On Psyche's unarmed form he bellowing flew;</br>'Twas there alone the knight his rage could fear;</br>Swifter than thought his flaming sword he drew,</br>And from his hand the doubtful javelin threw</br>Lest erring it might wound the trembling fair:</br>Eager the cruel monster to subdue</br>He scorned to use his shield's protecting care,</br>And rashly left his side in part exposed and bare.", "Sharp were the wounds of his avenging steel,</br>Which forced the roaring beast to quit the field:</br>Yet ere he fled, the knight unused to feel</br>The power of any foe, or e'er to yield</br>To any arm which sword or spear could wield,</br>Perceived the venom of his tooth impure;</br>But, with indignant silence, unrevealed</br>The pain he bore, while through the gloom obscure</br>The beast, in vain pursued, urged on his flight secure.", "And now the hag, delivered from her fear,</br>Her grateful thanks upon the knight bestowed,</br>And, as they onward went, in Psyche's ear</br>Her tongue with many a horrid tale o'erflowed,</br>Which warned her to forsake that venturous road,</br>And seek protection in the neighbouring grove;</br>Where dwelt a prudent dame, who oft bestowed</br>Her sage advice, when pilgrims doomed to rove,</br>Benighted there, had else with lurking dangers strove.", "The knight now

sheltered to pursue:</br>Now soon entangled in a gloomy maze</br>Psyche no longer has her knight in view,</br>Nor sees his page's star-crowned helmet blaze;</br>Close at her side alone the hag loquacious stays.", "Fearful she stops, and calls aloud in vain,</br>The storm-roused woods roar only in reply;</br>Anxious her loved protector to regain</br>She trembling listens to Credulity,</br>Who points where they a glimmering light may spy;</br>Which, through the shade of intervening trees</br>And all the misty blackness of the sky,</br>Casting a weak and dubious ray she sees,</br>And fain by this would seek her terrors to appease.", "Yet hoping that, allured by that same light</br>Which singly seemed through all the gloom to shine,</br>She there at last might meet

at once combine</br>A thousand shapeless forms of terror dire,</br>Here shrieks the ill-omened bird, there glares the meteor's fire.", "In the deep centre of the mazy wood,</br>With matted ivy and wild vine o'ergrown,</br>A Gothic castle solitary stood,</br>With massive walls built firm of murky stone;</br>Long had Credulity its mistress known,</br>Meagre her form and tawny was her hue,</br>Unsociably she lived, unloved, alone,</br>No cheerful prospects gladdened e'er her view,</br>And her pale hollow eyes oblique their glances threw.", "Now had they reached the sad and dreary bower</br>Where dark Disfida held her gloomy state:</br>The grated casements strong with iron power,</br>The huge port-cullis creaking o'er the gate,</br>The surly guards that round the draw-bridge

lone guest who weetless wandered,</br>But melancholy silence reigned around,</br>While on her arm she leaned her pensive head,</br>And anxious watched, as sullenly she frowned,</br>Of distant whispers low to catch the doubtful sound.", "Startled to hear an unaccustomed noise</br>Sudden she rose, and on the intruders bent</br>Her prying eye askance; but soon the voice</br>Of her old slave appeased her discontent,</br>And a half welcome to her guests she lent:</br>Her frequent questions satisfied at last,</br>Through all the neighbouring woods her scouts she sent</br>To seek the knight, while Psyche's tears flowed fast,</br>And all the live-long night in anxious woe she past.", "The sullen bell had told the midnight hour,</br>And sleep had laid the busy world to rest,</br>All but the watchful lady of that bower</br>And wretched Psyche:  her distracted breast</br>The agony of sad suspense opprest,</br>Now to the casement eagerly she flies,</br>And now the wished-for voice her fancy blest:</br>Alas!  the screaming night-bird only cries;</br>Only the drear obscure there meets her straining eyes.", "Has thy heart sickened with deferred hope?</br>Or felt the impatient anguish of suspense?</br>Or hast thou tasted of the bitter cup</br>Which disappointment's withered hands dispense?</br>Thou knowest the poison which o'erflowed from hence</br>O'er Psyche's tedious, miserable hours.</br>The unheeded notes of plaintive Innocence</br>No longer sooth her soul with wonted powers,</br>While false Disfida's tales her listening ear devours.", "Of rapid torrents and deep marshy fens,</br>Of ambushed foes and unseen pits they tell,</br>Of ruffians rushing from their secret dens,</br>Of foul magicians and of wizard spell,</br>The poisoned lance and net invisible;</br>While Psyche shuddering sees her knight betrayed</br>Into the snares of some enchanter fell,</br>Beholds him bleeding in the treacherous shade,</br>Or hears his dying voice implore in vain for aid.", "At length the cruel messengers return,</br>Their trampling steeds sound welcome in her ear;</br>Her rapid feet the ground impatient spurn,</br>As eagerly she flies their news to hear.</br>Alas!  they bring no tidings which may cheer</br>Her sorrowing soul opprest, disconsolate!</br>\"Dismiss,\" they cry, \"each idly timid fear!</br>No dangers now thy faithless knight await,</br>Lured by a wanton

crost,</br>Nor could she think his mind so lightly bent</br>Could swerve so quickly from its first intent;</br>Till sudden bursting forth in angry mood</br>Disfida gave her indignation vent,</br>\"Ah,
