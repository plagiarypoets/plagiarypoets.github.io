["As late I strove LUCILLA'S lip to kiss,</br>She with discurtesee reprov'd my will;</br>Dost thou, she said, affect so pleasant bliss,</br>A simple shepherd, and a losell vile?</br>Not Fancy's hand should join my courtly lip</br>To thine; as I myself were fast asleep.", "As thus she spake, full proud and boasting lasse,</br>And as a peacocke pearke, in dalliance</br>She bragly turned her ungentle face,</br>And all disdaining ey'd my shape askaunce:</br>But I did blush, with grief and shame yblent,</br>Like morning rose with hoary dewe besprent.", "Tell me, my fellows all, am I not fair?</br>Has fell enchantress blasted all my charms?</br>Whilom mine head was sleek with tressed hayre,</br>My laughing eyne did shoot out love's alarms:</br>E'en KATE did deemen me the fairest swain,</br>When erst I won this girdle on the plain.", "My lip with vermil was embellished,</br>My bagpipes notes loud and delicious were,</br>The milk-white lily, and the rose so read,</br>Did on my face depeinten lively cheere,</br>My voice as soote as mounting larke did shrill,</br>My look was blythe as MARG'RET'S at the mill.", "But she forsooth, more fair than MADGE or KATE,</br>A dainty maid, did deign no shepherd's love;</br>Nor wist what THENOT told us swains of late;</br>That VENUS sought a shepherd in a grove;</br>Nor that a heav'nly God, who PHOEBUS hight,</br>To tend his flock with shepherds did delight.&mdash;", "Ah! 'tis that VENUS with accurst despight,</br>That all my dolour, and my shame has made!</br>Nor does remembrance of her own delight,</br>For me one drop of pity sweet persuade?</br>Aye hence the glowing rapture may she miss,</br>Like me be scorn'd, nor ever taste a kiss!</br>"]
