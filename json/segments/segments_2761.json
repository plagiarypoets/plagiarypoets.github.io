["Come, ye nymphs, who're brisk and airy,</br>Handsome, tender, wanton, merry;</br>Come in flowing, loose attire,</br>Come and fan my raging fire;</br>Let me on your bosom press,</br>Height of joy and happiness:</br>Sages may their books approve,</br>All my study shall be love.", "Jolly Bacchus too attend,</br>Thou'rt the jovial lover's friend;</br>Bring thy mirth-inspiring liquor;</br>Bring it &mdash; faster &mdash; move thee quicker;</br>Let me drown my thirsty soul;</br>Come, ye nymphs, and kiss the bowl,</br>Make the gods in concert join,</br>Love is always fir'd by wine.", "Music's vot'ries next advance,</br>Leave the mazes of the dance,</br>All your instruments prepare,</br>Play the soft, the tender air;</br>Soothe my love with harmony;</br>Hark, ye nymphs, what melody!</br>Music's charms, with sparkling wine,</br>Shall, to heighten love, combine.", "This, ye gods, this, this is pleasure,</br>Thus will I employ my treasure:</br>Life's a span, and time still flying,</br>Let me never think of dying;</br>But enjoy the good possessing,</br>Riches!  Heaven's greatest blessing:</br>Music's charms, and love, and wine,</br>All in riches will combine.", "But, oh!  what pains do now assail me!</br>All my limbs and senses fail me!</br>Rack'd and tortur'd all over,</br>I now more can act the lover;</br>All my follies now o'er take me,</br>Mirth and pleasure quite forsake me:</br>Music seems no more divine,</br>Tasteless too is sparkling wine.", "Oh!  to late, I see my error,</br>In Experience's mirrour!</br>How my precious time I've wasted!</br>How to swift destruction hasted!</br>Diamonds, rubies, glittering gold,</br>Sapphires, pearls, in which I roll'd,</br>Cannot stay my fleeting breath:</br>Welcome then thou dreadful Death.</br>"]
