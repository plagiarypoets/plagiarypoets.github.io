["What glorious vision charms my wond'ring sight!</br>A Goddess with benignant smile appears;</br>Her graceful form, attir'd in robes of light,</br>And in her hand a rural pipe she bears.", "'Tis Gratitude!  I know the heav'nly Maid!</br>Whose bosom's with ecstatic feelings fraught;</br>Love and respect are in her mien display'd,</br>Her anxious looks express each inmost thought.", "Receive, she cries, receive this pipe, and play</br>Such sounds as I shall dictate to thine ear;</br>For lib'ral deeds demand thy noblest lay,</br>Such lays as Angels might with pleasure hear.", "Spare me, bright Goddess!  how shall words impart</br>Thy glowing sentiments which fire my breast?</br>Such shining, gen'rous deeds o'erwhelm my heart</br>With transports, ah!  too great to be exprest.", "O!  had I POPE'S or GRAY'S harmonious lyre,</br>O'er Nature's paths with THOMSON could I tread,</br>Or catch one vivid ray of SHAKESPEAR'S fire,</br>Or follow where seraphic MILTON led.", "Then would my Muse expand her ardent wings,</br>And far beyond these nether regions soar;</br>Drink deeply at Parnassus' hallow'd springs,</br>And Fancy's airy heights with ease explore.", "Then, led by chearful Hope, unaw'd by Fear,</br>I'd bend a constant vot'ry at thy shrine;</br>Such notes as thou should'st whisper to mine ear,</br>Should breath melodious through the flowing line.", "But since unerring Fate's divine decree</br>Has fix'd my lot to sing in humbler strain,</br>I'll sound the simplest shell, content to be</br>The last and lowest of the tuneful train.</br>"]
