["Chill winter's appearance was past,</br>Its reign so unfeeling was done;</br>The breeze had succeeded the blast,</br>The twins had received the sun;</br>And daisies had chequer'd the scene,</br>Impurpled by violets in bloom,</br>When Eliza mov'd over the green,</br>And knelt by the side of a tomb.", "A willow bent over her head,</br>The emblem of grief and despair,</br>Whose branches luxuriantly spread,</br>And hung with a sorrowful air.</br>She said, my lov'd parent so dear,</br>No tablet I need to explain,</br>My heart would have told me 'twas here</br>Its first dearest object was lain!", "The bosom on which I have slept,</br>The arms that entwin'd me so oft,</br>The eyes that so frequently wept,</br>So sweet, so endearingly soft,</br>Are cold, and enclos'd in the tomb;</br>Unseen are the tears which I shed,</br>Yet here for to weep I am come;</br>How low lies, my parent, thy head!", "Yet mine has found ease on thy breast,</br>When lain has invaded my frame;</br>When Grief's heavy hand has oppress'd,</br>My pillow was ever the same.</br>Ye tender, ye feeling of heart,</br>Who have writh'd beneath agony's steel,</br>O say, can affliction impart</br>A sorrow more deep than I feel?", "When we view a dear object of love</br>To pain or to anguish a prey,</br>The pangs we by sympathy prove</br>Make us faint and feeble as they;</br>For O, when the passion is pure,</br>When love from pure tenderness flows,</br>We would die, so our deaths would impart</br>A lasting contentment to those.", "But oh, when a friend of the heart</br>Lies pallid and panting for breath,</br>O say, does the view not impart</br>A feeling more painful than death?</br>Dear saint whose abode is above,</br>For angel in heaven thou art,</br>Send down from the regions of love</br>Relief to my agoniz'd heart!", "Is it fancy that steals on my mind?</br>Or is it thy form that I view?</br>So tender the look, and so kind,</br>Past scenes it appears to renew.</br>But ah, sad reflection appears,</br>And tells me I'm destin'd to mourn;</br>The scenes which have cheated my tears</br>Will never, no never return.", "The friend of my youth is no more!</br>Yet why should I endless repine?</br>Her precepts I'll ever adore,</br>Her virtues I'll strive to make mine.</br>Which said, she withdrew from the scene,</br>From the marble her tears had bedew'd,</br>Again she mov'd over the green,</br>And daily the scene was renew'd.</br>"]
