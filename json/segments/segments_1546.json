["Some with affected scorn disdain thee, Life,</br>Yet live to talk of this their proud disdain;</br>Some, truly wearied with unhappy strife,</br>Would not retrace thy fleeting course again;</br>Some die while living; most exist in vain,</br>And pass away as if they had not been:</br>For me, within thy precincts I'd remain</br>Till with due glory I can quit the scene;</br>From thee, till then, I can't my fond affections wean.", "Thou had such store of pleasures for the soul,</br>Pleasures which to have shared we ne'er repent,</br>And, each day, winding out thy lessening scroll,</br>Dost heap our knowledge with a sweet consent;</br>Yet less we value what thy hand has lent,</br>Than th' unseen remnant which thou dost withhold,</br>For man's vain race is ever madly bent</br>To think the future wove of richest gold,</br>While what is past they hate, as brittle, base and old.", "In this I also differ with my kind,</br>Viewing the far-seen texture of the past</br>As a sweet bed, on which my soul reclined</br>While drinking in youth's visions wild and vast;</br>No look of vain regret I backward cast,</br>Nor wish one nook of all the scene erased;</br>But place the passing moment with the last,</br>And see them trooping off quite unamazed,</br>As shepherd views his flocks when they have fully grazed.", "Thrice happy they, who every day can say,</br>Would that the present time might last for ever!</br>And though they know that like a shade away</br>They pass, relax not in the proud endeavour</br>To raise the trophy that no time shall sever</br>From its wide base upon th' eternal world:</br>What Genius and what Virtue props can never</br>Stoop to the dust, though Death his missiles hurl'd,</br>Each shore dispeopling where Fame's banners stream unfurl'd.", "New nations faster rise than Death can waste;</br>As on heaven's champaign, when the warring wind</br>Drives fierce the clouds, more speedy than his haste</br>The thickening darking volumes stream behind,</br>The infinite ocean with the sun combined</br>Lifting the endless masses from the deep,</br>Laugh Eolus to scorn, and make him find</br>How vain his rage!  till, tired, his monsters creep</br>Within their hollow caves to roar themselves to sleep.", "This thought adds sharpness to the thirst of fame,</br>And smooths the toil of many a midnight hour;</br>For who would not an ark-like fabric frame,</br>Endued by Genius with the wondrous power,</br>To bear, in spite of storms and wasting shower,</br>His freighted name earth's living deluge o'er;</br>Since Time in vain shall hunger to devour</br>The growing myriads, and with sceptre hoar,</br>Shall scan th' eternal race increasing wore and more.</br>"]
