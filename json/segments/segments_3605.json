["Hail SCOTIA, realm of ancient might,</br>Renown'd for matchless deeds of fight;</br>Though spread with rugged mountains round,</br>Though bleak thy air, and bare thy ground,</br>Let others boast a milder air,</br>And fields with richer plenty fair,</br>A noble praise belongs to thee,</br>The courage of the brave, and spirit of the free!", "Thy mountains Roman power defied,</br>Repulsed their armies, check'd their pride,</br>And Rome from Scottish courage found,</br>Its universal empire's bound:</br>These mountains, of the brave the seat,</br>Gave freedom still its last retreat,</br>Our Sires, assailed by numbers, stood,</br>There braved the source of foes, and poured their generous blood.", "Long were they press'd by stronger foes,</br>And fierce the strife of battle rose,</br>To numbers forc'd to quit the field,</br>But never basely known to yield;</br>For rights attack'd by party-rage,</br>They fought and died through ev'ry age,</br>Till freedom crowned their generous toil,</br>Bade peace adorn the land, and plenty bless the soil.", "Now Commerce spread her swelling sails,</br>Invoked the aid of friendly gales,</br>And dar'd in quest of wealth explore</br>The products of each distant shore;</br>Arts, smiling, followed in her train,</br>Together Arts and Commerce reign,</br>And, frightened long by hostile rage,</br>The Muse, with peace restored, inspired the classic page.", "EDINA, to thy sons belong</br>The meeds of Science and of Song;</br>Thine seldom gained in modern days</br>The palm of the Historic praise;</br>Thine Med'cine's salutary art,</br>Skilled aid more powerful to impart;</br>Thine, what, or useful, or refin'd,</br>Can strengthen, or adorn, improve, or please the mind.", "But to the SCOTTISH Muse's sway,</br>While distant vot'ries homage pay,</br>And seek, assembled from each shore,</br>EDINA'S walls, in quest of lore,</br>See, the rude work of ancient hands,</br>The fav'rite seat of Learning stands;</br>No costly art, nor strength displays,</br>A mean and shapeless pile, that with each blast decays!", "While Commerce, with unsparing hand,</br>Diffuses riches through the land,</br>In the gay square, and crowded street,</br>While works of art and wealth we meet,</br>And thus enlarged, adorned to view,</br>EDINA seems to rise anew;</br>Shall this alone, the nation's stain,</br>Thus meanly poor, and rude, shall Learning's seat remain?", "No more &mdash; Methinks I see the wall</br>Already tottering to its fall!</br>Methinks I see the rising pile</br>The future glory of our isle!</br>Ye rich, and great, the tribute pay,</br>Your bounty here, your taste display,</br>With liberal hand the structure rear,</br>Whose fame, nor sudden rage, nor slow decay, shall fear!", "Already in the grand design</br>See art and opulence combine!</br>While wealth affords the rich supplies,</br>See, planned by art, the structure rise,</br>Where strength and beauty claim a place,</br>And regularity and grace,</br>Simple, yet great, adorned, yet plain</br>Abode, where every Muse, and every grace may reign!", "Seat of the learned and the polite,</br>There science shall with taste unite,</br>And there again, no more deplored,</br>Another Athens be restored,</br>While crowds admiring shall repair</br>In quest of distant knowledge there.</br>Thus said the Muse, &mdash; and bade me pay</br>Sincere, though small, the tribute of a lay!</br>"]
