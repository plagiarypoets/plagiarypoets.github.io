["Here, I may breathe \"Farewell\" &mdash; here, hang the lyre:</br>On this rent stone, the Muses' altar, pay</br>One grateful tribute, one memorial lay;</br>Ere with slow step reluctant I retire,</br>Recall'd from visions of the Bards of old,</br>Who sang of Saturn's realm, and feign'd an age of gold.", "Throughout the charmed air the echoes float</br>Of Latian songs:  a voice from Anio breathes:</br>Or where through trembling reeds slow Mincius wreathes</br>His winding way:  and soft and sweet the note</br>Comes from the Bard who mourn'd in Sirmio's cave,</br>And still'd to peace the storm that swell'd Benacus' wave.", "Flow on, ye sounds of Inspiration flow!</br>And Thou, creative Fancy breathe the spell</br>That draws the visions to this haunted cell!</br>Give all, that charm'd my sight, again to glow,</br>And, ere the disinchanted colours fade,</br>Brighten each beauteous tint, and soothe each harsher shade.", "Yet, yet again before my wistful sight</br>Fix each far bound of that wide-varying scene,</br>And all of loveliest view that rose between:</br>Here, poise Mont-Blanc on his aerial height,</br>Th' eternal Monarch on his mountain throne,</br>Who, when earth sinks in shade, looks on the sun, alone:", "There, spread the waste beyond Salerno's bay</br>And silver cliffs with tower and convent crown'd;</br>And to my search expose that hallow'd ground</br>Where age on age rolls on unfelt away,</br>While rob'd in Dorian stole, chaste, stern, sublime,</br>Genius from Paestum's fane turns back the scythe of Time.</br>"]
