["Hence!  unrelenting cares,</br>That haunt the proud, and rend the miser's breast,</br>And far expel delightsome rest,</br>And bring disquiet, sleepless nights, and starting fears;</br>Hence!  and that mind controul,</br>Where sickly Pining takes her hated seat,</br>With Grief and Dread; companions meet:</br>There, far from me, exert thine iron sway,</br>And every tedious night and day</br>Reign o'er the heart, and occupy the soul.</br>But come, thou goddess, fond and free,</br>Auspicious Love, and dwell with me,</br>Thou whom, with thy wreathed shell,</br>Old Ocean bore (as poets tell)</br>While round thee, beauteous, blooming maid,</br>Deftly the frisking dolphins play'd.</br>Come, and bring thy wanton Boy,</br>Cause of fondness, source of joy,</br>And bid him take that golden dart,</br>That erst transfix'd Apollo's heart,</br>When, with full force and winged speed,</br>O'er tufted lawn, and flowery mead,</br>Now slow, with long toil, up some steep,</br>Now down precipitately deep,</br>Thro' many a grove, and many a glade,</br>The god pursued the flying maid.</br>Bring besides thy joyous train,</br>Soft supporters of thy reign,</br>Wanton smiles, endearments charming,</br>Mirth and coyness unalarming,</br>Whispers, kisses, sighs, and fears,</br>Lovely looks and trickling tears,</br>Joy of festive, sprightly mien,</br>And Innocence of look serene;</br>Thy smiling train can never cloy,</br>If led by Innocence and Joy.</br>Permit me, goddess, fond and free,</br>To join with them, and join with thee;</br>Ever present, ever by,</br>Thus let me live, thus let me die.</br>Rise we when the meek-eyed morn</br>Doth the spangled meads adorn;</br>When every bird, from every spray,</br>Tunes various his love-labour'd lay.</br>Lo!  from yon cloud the flaming sun</br>'Gins his stated course to run,</br>Brightening rays incessant streaming,</br>Dew drops sparkling, twinkling, beaming,</br>Refreshed Nature smiles anew,</br>And brings her brightest charms to view.</br>On Delia thinking will I stray,</br>Heedless, where I chuse the way,</br>Over distant hills and dales,</br>Bleating mountains, lowing vales;</br>By silent river, rolling flood,</br>Fringed meadow, waving wood,</br>Where Flora does her sweets dispense,</br>And different prospects please the sense.</br>While sturdy oxen, grazing nigh,</br>With loud lowings fill the sky;</br>And the swallow skims the ground,</br>And the lambkin bleateth round,</br>And many a cuckow's echoing note</br>Wavering to the ear doth float.</br>Such pleasing sounds and sights inspire</br>Glowing love and soft desire.</br>Sweet hour of pleasure!  then, to chuse,</br>Breathe the soft strain, and court the muse,</br>Fairest Delia be my theme,</br>By some whispering, silver stream,</br>That thro' the painted meads doth stray,</br>And swiftly trickling winds away.</br>And when the sun, exalted high,</br>Fierce-glowing, measures half the sky;</br>Oft, oh!  my Delia, will we rove</br>Along some close-embowred grove&mdash;</br>Oh!  the soft joys that fill the breast!</br>(Joys, the sweetest and the best)</br>When, by all-powerful Love excited,</br>Each delighting, each delighted,</br>We sit within some thick-wove bower</br>Full fragrant made by many a flower!</br>With thrilling pleasure I the while</br>Eye the kind glance, or dimpling smile;</br>Or oft, in sweet suspension hung,</br>Catch the music of her tongue,</br>Else in sweet notes briskly moving,</br>Airy, fluttering, wild, and roving,</br>Thrice and four times, and again</br>Both chaunt to love the pleasing strain.</br>Or if the garden's flowery pride</br>Call our vagrant steps aside,</br>Here unnumber'd charms invite,</br>Roses red, and lillies white;</br>Here, 'mid blooming fragrance straying,</br>Sweetly smiling, fondly playing,</br>Oft my willing hands prepare</br>Odorous garlands for my Fair,</br>And mix, around the charmer's head,</br>The lilly's white, the rose's red:</br>While Love inspires each warbler's throat,</br>Smooths the strain, or swells the note,</br>All around, and all above,</br>All is Joy, for all is Love.", "But when the cooling evening breeze</br>Moves gently the reluctant trees,</br>Then will we oft-times stray unseen</br>By winding walks of willows green,</br>And there the charms of music prove,</br>For music is the food of Love:</br>Inspiring oft the warbling flute,</br>Now with complaining strains that suit</br>The vexed thoughts and barbed care</br>Of fixed, sullen, deep despair;</br>Now more luxuriant strains employ,</br>Quickening Love, and brightening Joy;</br>Such as might the soul beguile,</br>And make disturbed sorrow smile;</br>Now the music varying floats,</br>Then stops:  anon more still the notes,</br>Smooth and languid, soft and low,</br>Tender, trilling, sweet and slow,</br>Keep on the long-continued sound,</br>And charm attention all around.</br>Strait my breast hath caught new pleasures,</br>Throbs my pulse in fluttering measures,</br>Grief defeated and retiring,</br>Joys my raptur'd heart inspiring,</br>While my whole soul, devoid of care,</br>Hangs all-enamour'd on the fair,</br>And she, well-pleas'd, my looks surveys,</br>And plays and smiles, and smiles and plays.", "When night's brown shades invite to rest,</br>And nature sinks by sleep opprest,</br>Then too, oh let me fond repair</br>To flowery meadows with my Fair,</br>Let mimic fancy paint her charms,</br>And bring my angel to my arms,</br>Let us together secret stray,</br>And all the night re-act the day.", "Auspicious Goddess, fond and free,</br>Bestow these pleasures all on me,</br>(For sure these pleasures thou canst give)</br>And, Love, with thee I'll chuse to live.</br>"]
