["As Joe with his pails went a milking one morn,</br>Young Sally he saw sitting under a thorn;</br>Amaz'd at her beauty, her shape and her mien,</br>He vow'd she was lovely, and thought her a Queen.", "Thus saying, he hasten'd up close to the maid,</br>Then laid down his yoke, and intreated her aid;</br>So sweetly he press'd her &mdash; so sweet play'd his part,</br>That would you suppose it?  he won her fond heart.", "At first she look'd modest, and seem'd to resist,</br>And cried, do not teaze me!  I will not be kiss'd!</br>But he his persuasions so sweetly applied,</br>She kindly consented she would be his bride.", "Then streight to the church they both tript it so free,</br>Where they were united by Hymen's decree;</br>And now are as chearful as birds on the spray,</br>No Monarchs more blest, nor so happy as they.</br>"]
