["If, shepherde, heavenlie beautye can thee move,</br>If gentle courtesie can charme thy mynde,</br>Let not thine eyes e'er stray to her I love,</br>O liste not to her wordes moste sweet and kynde!</br>Though sweete and kynde her wordes, and voide of arte,</br>Yet cold indifference dwelleth in her hearte.", "Doste thou admyre a looke both bryghte and meeke?</br>The starre of eve beams in her modeste eye:</br>Lovste thou the rose? &mdash; 'tis on her blushynge cheeke,</br>And lendes its honied fragrance to her sigh;</br>Alas!  that she should sigh my payne to see,</br>Yet still escape from love's captivity!", "O where can I, to shunne the archer's aime,</br>Flie from those charmes that have my peace undonne!</br>To wisdome's page? &mdash; No, wisdome fannes my flame,</br>And virtue sayes, thy faire and I are one:</br>Ah me!  that hopelesse I am doomde to pyne,</br>To see those sweetes, yet may not call them myne!</br>"]
