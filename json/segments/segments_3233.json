["When JOVE to punish guilty man,</br>His fiat to PANDORA gave,</br>To scatter plagues o'er every land,</br>And death coneal in every wave.</br>Of horrid crimes the just rewards,</br>From the dire pox thou flow'st, the scourge of impious bards.", "Dread power!  around whose dusky brow</br>Somnific poppies form a wreath,</br>When from some mist clad mountain thou</br>Enwrapt'st in shades the vale beneath;</br>Or riding in November's storm,</br>With pestilential breath, dost nature's face deform.", "Where'er thou spread'st thy raven wing,</br>Dire winter wears a thicker gloom,</br>Mute all the music of the spring,</br>Nor Maia breathes a sweet perfume.</br>No flow'ret buds, nor zephyr blows,</br>But sudden hemlocks rise, and baleful nightshade grows.", "With love of deathless glory fir'd,</br>The man of verse invokes the nine,</br>And still as fancy seems inspir'd,</br>A laurel grasps in every line.</br>Thy power, oblivious, oft presides,</br>And far from Pindar's grove the slumb'ring poet guides.", "Stern foe to ev'ry lovely muse,</br>Whose leaden eye-balls ghastly roll!</br>Thy dimly-gleaming looks diffuse</br>A chearless languour o'er my soul!</br>O grant my humble suppliant's prayer,</br>To dark Cimmerian caves, and dreary damps repair.", "Or would'st thou rule a kindred dear</br>To BELGIA'S low-spread region fly,</br>Where through the wide revolving year,</br>Congenial vapours shut the sky;</br>And yawning millions crave thy reign</br>There 'mid eternal fogs, thy sluggish sway maintain.</br>"]
