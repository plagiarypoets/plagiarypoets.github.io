["What is the aim with which the poet glows,</br>The recompense of fiction's fairy line,</br>The hope, that o'er the languid spirit throws</br>Reviving light, and makes its toils divine?</br>Is it, to see the smile of beauty shine</br>Over the fruit of solitary hours,</br>When fancy's wing, weary, would else decline?</br>It is, it is; like Spring's life-giving showers,</br>That smile awakes the germs of song's luxuriant flowers.", "Then, because beauty is the soul of song,</br>We bring to thee (the beautiful), to thee,</br>The tributary lay of many a tongue;</br>Acknowledgment of beauty's sovereignty:</br>And, blended with thy name, prolong'd may be</br>The swift decaying echoes of our lyre&mdash;</br>The lyre of many strings, that, wildly free,</br>To harmonize in beauty's praise aspire&mdash;</br>The lyre, that many strike to one whom all admire.", "Unto the beautiful is beauty due;</br>For thee the graver's art has multiplied</br>The forms the painter's touch reveals to view,</br>Array'd in warm imagination's pride</br>Of loveliness (in this to thee allied).</br>And well with these accord poetic lays</br>(Two several streams from the same urn supplied);</br>Each to the other lends a winning grace,</br>As features speak the soul &mdash; the soul informs the face.", "And if this little offering, brought to thee,</br>Shall meet thy sight in life's hereafter hours,</br>Perhaps not all unwelcome it may be,</br>To wake the sweets of youth's declining flowers&mdash;</br>Blossoms, as yet unsullied by the showers</br>That fall from the pale urn that sorrow rears.&mdash;</br>Still be it so; and may Time's latter stores</br>Unfold for thee sweet memories of past years,</br>The KEEPSAKE of the soul, to guard thine eyes from tears.</br>"]
