["Let SHENSTONE, in sweet flowing verse,</br>The charms of his PHYLLIS declare,</br>But what can the Poets rehearse,</br>That may not be seen in my Fair?</br>The sweets which Arabia displays,</br>With her breath unsuccessfully vie;</br>The Diamond would fade, and its rays</br>Be dimm'd, by a glance from her eye.", "Her tresses which carelessly flow</br>In her fair neck, enchantingly play;</br>Her bosom is whiter than snow&mdash;</br>Her blush like the Roses of May;</br>But vainly I strive to express</br>What beauties her person has join'd;</br>It is form'd to delight and to bless,</br>And equall'd alone by her mind.", "While my pen pleasing Fancy inclines</br>A subject so dear to pursue,</br>Would you know whom the writer designs?</br>Irresistible girl!  it is you&mdash;</br>O mildly your beauties employ,</br>Nor fill the fond bosom with care,</br>For your smile is the parent of Joy,</br>Your frown the sad source of Despair.", "Nor let a true Lover in vain</br>Submit to the force of your charms;</br>But tenderly hear him complain,</br>And yield the rich prize to his arms;</br>And since for sweet Love you are made,</br>And destin'd each bosom to move,</br>To him let your homage be paid,</br>In youth &mdash; the fit season for Love.</br>"]
