["The month of fair Venus is fled,</br>Maia has quitted the scene;</br>Bright Juno now visits the shade,</br>And smiles at the nymphs on the green.</br>Who now, in simplicity drest,</br>Walk careless abroad in the morn;</br>A flow'ret now graces each breast,</br>And health does their faces adorn.", "Tho' plumage ne'er nods on their heads,</br>Yet these can enamour the heart;</br>For beauty resides in the shades,</br>Where Nature surpasses all Art:</br>The Goddess in rapture surveys,</br>Nor can her attention remove;</br>\"Thy daughters, Britannia,\" she says,</br>\"Shall hence be the daughters of Love.\"", "Thus saying, she wav'd her fair hand,</br>Dame Flora attends at her call;</br>\"Sweet odours diffuse o'er the land,</br>And all thy gay carpet unroll:</br>For this is my festival day,</br>The zenith of all my mild reign;</br>Ye birds, swell your notes on the spray,</br>Rejoice ev'ry nymph with her swain.", "\"But first cull a chaplet with speed,</br>An elegant garden compose;</br>Take a slip from each flow'r in the mead,</br>In the midst place my favourite rose:</br>And lastly (each sense to invite)</br>Let blossoms of hawthorn be seen,</br>Let the myrtle and woodbine unite,</br>And thyme deck the margin with green.\"", "Now Phoebus's heart-chearing rays</br>The dews from the meadow exhale;</br>Now, fiercer and potent, the blaze</br>Earth's inmost recesses assail:</br>O let me retire to the shade,</br>Beneath the oak's umbrage recline;</br>Invite the coy Muse to my aid,</br>While Nature with Art I define.", "Now flutter the insects abroad,</br>In all their bright pageantry gay;</br>Whose period no respite affords,</br>How transient and short is their day!</br>Yet these are endu'd with quick sense,</br>Like thee they share pleasure and pain;</br>Be humble, vain mortal, and hence</br>From barbarous actions refrain.", "The cataract, heart from afar,</br>With vigour inspirits my lay;</br>Let me Nature's suffrages share,</br>I ask not a sprig from the bay.</br>Tho' simple and artless the strain,</br>Thy beauties, O Summer!  I sing;</br>Shou'd Virtue make me of her train,</br>A yearly oblation I'll bring.", "Sequester'd, and far in the vale,</br>Beneath the umbrageous retreat,</br>Palaemon rehearses his tale,</br>And sighs at his Phillis's feet:</br>Unpractis'd in treach'rous arts,</br>The virgin his passion approves;</br>The smile of consent she imparts,</br>And Hymen rewards their fond loves.</br>"]
