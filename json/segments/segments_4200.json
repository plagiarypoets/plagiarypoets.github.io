["Lo!  where the party-giving dames,</br>Fair Fashion's train appear,</br>Disclose the long-expected games,</br>And wake the modish year,</br>The Opera warbler pours her throat,</br>Responsive to the actor's note,</br>The dear-bought harmony of Spring;</br>While, beaming pleasure as they fly,</br>Bright flambeaus through the murky sky,</br>Their welcome fragrance fling.", "Where'er the rout's full myriads close</br>The staircase and the door,</br>Where'er thick files of belles and beaus,</br>Perspire through ev'ry pore;</br>Beside some faro-table's brink,</br>With me the Muse shall stand and think,</br>(Hemm'd sweetly in by squeeze of state),</br>How vast the comfort of the crowd,</br>How condescending are the proud,</br>How happy are the great!", "Still is the toiling hand of Care,</br>The drays and hacks repose;</br>But, hark, how through the vacant air</br>The rattling clamour grows!</br>The wanton miss and rakish blade,</br>Eager to join the masquerade,</br>Through streets and squares pursue their fun;</br>Home in the dusk some bashful skim;</br>Some, ling'ring late, their motly trim</br>Exhibit to the sun.", "To Dissipation's playful eye,</br>Such is the life for man,</br>And they that halt and they that fly</br>Should have no other plan.</br>Alike the busy and the gay</br>Should sport all night till break of day,</br>In Fashion's varying colours drest;</br>Till seiz'd for debt through rude mischance,</br>Or chill'd by age, they leave the dance,</br>In gaol or dust &mdash; to rest.", "Methinks I hear, in accents low,</br>Some sober Quiz reply,</br>Poor child of Folly!  what art thou?</br>A Bond-street Butterfly!</br>Thy choice nor Health nor Nature greets,</br>No taste hast thou of vernal sweets,</br>Enslav'd by noise, and dress, and play,</br>Ere thou art to the country flown,</br>The sun will scorch, the Spring be gone,</br>Then leave the town in May.</br>"]
