["Beautiful fabric!  even in decay</br>And desolation, beauty still is thine:</br>As the rich sunset of an autumn day,</br>When gorgeous clouds in glorious hues combine</br>To render homage to its slow decline,</br>Is more majestic in its parting hour;</br>Even so thy mouldering, venerable shrine</br>Possesses now a more subduing power,</br>Than in thine earlier sway with pomp and pride thy dower.", "To voice of praise or prayer, or solemn sound</br>Of sacred music, once familiar here,</br>Thy walls are echoless; within their bound,</br>Once holy deem'd, and to religion dear,</br>No sound salutes the most attentive ear</br>That tells thy former destiny; unless</br>It be when fitful breezes wandering near</br>Wake such faint sighs, as feebly might express</br>Some unseen spirit's woe for thy lost loveliness.", "Or when on stormy nights the winds are high,</br>And through thy roofless walls and arches sweep,</br>In tones more full of thrilling harmony,</br>Than art could reach; while from the neighbouring deep</br>The roar of bursting billows seems to keep</br>Accordant measure with the tempest's chime;</br>Oh, then!  at times have I, arous'd from sleep,</br>Fancied that thou, even in thy proudest prime,</br>No music couldst have known more awfully sublime.", "But to the eye, revolving years still add</br>Fresh charms, which make thee lovelier to the view;</br>For nature has luxuriantly clad</br>Thy ruins; as if wishing to renew</br>Their claim to homage from those hearts that woo</br>Her gentle influence:  with indulgent hand</br>She has aton'd for all that time could do,</br>Though she might not his ravages withstand;</br>And now thou art her own:  her skill thy beauties plann'd.", "The mantling ivy's ever-verdant wreath</br>She gave thee as her livery to wear;</br>Thy wall-flowers, waving at the gentlest breath,</br>And scattering perfume on the summer air,</br>Wooing the bee to come and labour there;</br>The clinging moss, whose hue of sober grey</br>Makes beautiful what else were bleak and bare;</br>These she has given thee as a fit array</br>For thy declining pomp, and her delightful sway.", "Yet, is it not her power, or these alone</br>That make thee interesting as thou art;</br>The merely beautiful, however prone</br>We are to prize it, could not touch the heart.</br>Mere form and colour would not thus impart,</br>Unto the pensive, contemplating mind,</br>Thoughts which might almost cause a tear to start</br>In eyes not given to weep:  there is assign'd</br>To thee a stronger power in deeper feeling shrin'd.", "It is a consciousness of what thou wert,</br>Compar'd with what thou art; a feeling sense</br>Which even steals upon the most inert,</br>Who have the least conception how, or whence</br>Such mixt sensation should arise from thence;</br>But so it is, that few there are can gaze</br>Upon the wrecks of old magnificence,</br>Nor own the moral that their fate conveys,</br>How all that man can build his own brief power betrays.", "And most of all this truth arrests the heart,</br>When edifices that were meant to be,</br>Not mere mementos of the builder's art,</br>That future ages should with wonder see;</br>But monuments of wealth and piety,</br>To the MOST HIGH for ever consecrate;</br>When these, too, share the fate now fallen on thee,</br>Who can with stoic coldness contemplate</br>Their splendour thusdefac'd, their pomp thus desolate?", "No catholic am I, in whom the sight</br>Of glories tarnish'd, altars overthrown,</br>Aught of revengeful feeling could excite:</br>Pope, Cardinal, and Abbot, I disown</br>Alike, as empty titles; seldom shown</br>More insignificant and profitless,</br>Than where they once assum'd their haughtiest tone;</br>Yet do I feel what words cannot express,</br>Viewing the faded pride of fancied holiness.", "Of fancied holiness!  O say not so,</br>Nor judge unkindly of another's creed;</br>The intent and motive God alone can know,</br>And these condemn, or sanctify the deed.</br>Ave-maria, crucifix and bead</br>Are nothing in themselves; but if they were</br>Imagin'd helpful in the votary's need,</br>Although a faith more spiritual may spare</br>Such outward aids to seek, from blame it may forbear.", "And thus this gorgeous edifice, if rear'd</br>By piety, which sought with honest aim</br>The glory of THE LORD, should be rever'd,</br>Even for that cause, by those who seek the same.</br>Perchance the builders err'd; but who shall blame</br>Error, nor feel that they partake it too?</br>Then judge with charity, whate'er thy name,</br>Be thou a Pagan, Protestant, or Jew;</br>Nor with a scornful glance these papal reliques view.", "I grant that Popery's was a galling yoke;</br>Its ritual, one that reason must disdain:</br>And much I venerate their names who broke</br>The fetters, and releas'd us from the chain.</br>Dreadful indeed is superstition's reign,</br>And priestcraft has pollution in its touch;</br>Yet, as extremes beget extremes again,</br>There is a danger, or there may be such,</br>That we in turn may doubt, as they believ'd, too much.", "To give implicit credence to each tale</br>Of monkish legends; reliques to adore;</br>To think GOD honour'd by the cowl or veil,</br>Reckless or who, or what, the emblem wore;</br>Indeed is mockery, mummery, nothing more:</br>But if cold scepticism usurp the place</br>That superstition held in days of yore,</br>We may not be in much more hopeful case</br>Than if we still implor'd the Virgin Mary's grace.", "There is a medium, could we find it out,</br>(And all may find it if they seek aright,)</br>Between extreme credulity and doubt;</br>A safe and middle path, not gain'd by might</br>Or wisdom of our own; a path, whose light</br>\"Shines more and more unto the perfect day;\"</br>Not overcast by bigotry's dark night,</br>Nor faintly lit by reason's twilight ray;</br>But cloudless, straight, and plain; a high and holy way.", "And those who walk therein, with humble trust</br>In Him who cast it up, and led them there,</br>Remembering this, that they are form'd of dust,</br>The gifts they have receiv'd with meekness bear:</br>Reason and faith are such; a peerless pair,</br>Would man but use them both with holy awe,</br>And of the abuse of each, in turn, beware,</br>They would instruct him what to love &mdash; to abhor,</br>And how to live in peace, and keep GOD's righteous law.", "But I have wander'd widely from my theme,</br>And some perhaps may think have wander'd long;</br>Yet others more indulgently may deem,</br>Nor chide the minstrel for his sober song:</br>It could not well be gay, thus fram'd among</br>The desolate ruins of departed days,</br>And years gone by, whose presence wakes a throng</br>Of pensive thoughts, compelling me to raise,</br>In contemplative mood, chasten'd and solemn lays&mdash;", "Congenial to the scene; and, as is fit,</br>Imprest with somewhat of its temper'd hues;</br>One, if no more, I trust will cherish it,</br>When she, the past retracing, shall peruse</br>This frail memorial of an humble muse:</br>For she will then remember how, erewhile,</br>Far from her home upon the banks of Ouse,</br>She wander'd with me through this ruin'd pile,</br>When autumn's setting sun shed round his softest smile.", "Yes, thou, my young friend, will not soon forget,</br>Nor shouldst thou, visiting this lovely scene;</br>Because upon thy brow thou bear'st as yet</br>Youth's joyous chaplet of unblighted green,</br>Surpassing far the poet's bay, I ween;</br>For the fresh dews which unto thine dispense</br>Its living loveliness &mdash; its charm serene,</br>Rise from the fount of early innocence,</br>That makes in happy hearts its hidden residence.", "Thou art exactly at the age, when all</br>Within, each outward beauty can enhance;</br>When bliss has too much novelty to pall,</br>As it does afterward in life's advance,</br>Even reality may seem romance;</br>It often does, while yet delight is new;</br>And time, and place, and trivial circumstance,</br>That feed the eager fancy, charm the view,</br>At such an age as thine, may last existence through.", "Therefore do I believe, that in thy heart</br>These ruins will their own remembrance keep;</br>And, sketch'd with them on memory's faithful chart,</br>Will be, the wild walk to the mighty deep,</br>The lone and shady spot for washing sheep,</br>Where the tall, trembling aspens ceaseless play,</br>And we stood still to hear the light winds sweep</br>Their rustling leaves, while, in the unseen bay,</br>We heard the billows' dash:  these shall not pass away!", "Nor will the scene that hail'd us at the close</br>Of our wild ramble, less survive to each;</br>When we exchang'd the stillness and repose</br>Of the lone common, for the open beach;</br>And saw before us, far as eye could reach,</br>The bursting breakers fling their foam on high,</br>And felt how poor was all the power of speech</br>To paint the grandeur and rude melody</br>That spoke, in nature's tone, to heart, and ear, and eye.", "Farewell!  I may not lengthen out a strain</br>Already too protracted; then, farewell!</br>Nor shall I think that I have writ in vain,</br>If they, who love such scenes, whose bosoms swell</br>With those pure feelings that delight to dwell</br>In yet untroubled hearts; if such shall own</br>That I have spoken what their tongues would tell,</br>Returning from such haunts:  that praise alone</br>Shall recompense me well, and for the task atone.</br>"]
