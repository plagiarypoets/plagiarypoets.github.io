["O Shepherds!  'tis CORYDON'S knell,</br>That, sounding, now saddens the wind:</br>When he bade us for ever farewell,</br>He left not an equal behind.", "How often ye dwelt on his strain,</br>That fill'd with sweet echoes the grove!</br>How happy the nymphs of the plain,</br>When he soften'd the bosom to love!", "Our garlands his tomb shall adorn;</br>His shade shall our praises receive;</br>The lark shall salute him at morn,</br>And Philomel soothe him at eve.", "Near his ashes the myrtle shall bloom,</br>Which PITY will plant with a sigh,</br>And, oft as she visits his tomb,</br>Lament that such merit should die.", "He sought not false fame to obtain:</br>To the SHEPHERD no art did belong;</br>SIMPLICITY taught him her strain;</br>SIMPLICITY govern'd his song.", "Lo!  his reed that lies mute on the ground,&mdash;</br>For with him its sweet sorrows depart!</br>For like him, none can give it a sound,</br>That tell's a fond tale of the HEART!</br>"]
