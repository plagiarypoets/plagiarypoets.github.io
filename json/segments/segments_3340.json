["Blythe Colin, a pretty young Swain,</br>To court me, walks many a Mile;</br>I bid him return back again again,</br>Tho' I wish'd him to stay a great while.</br>With all by which Love is exprest,</br>He studies my Heart to beguile;</br>I wish him Success I protest,</br>Tho' &mdash; I tell him he'll wait a great while!", "He brought me this Nosegay so sweet,</br>And thought it more Pleasure than Toil;</br>I took it, reserv'd, and discreet,</br>But I'll not let him wait a great while:</br>He begg'd to grant him a Kiss,</br>So earnest, he made me quite smile;</br>Have done, I cried, fie!  'tis amiss,</br>Tho' I wish'd it to last a great while!", "He tells me I ought to be kind,</br>That Time all my Beauties will spoil;</br>I cross him &mdash; tho' quite of his Mind,</br>For I love he shou'd talk a great while.</br>I fancy by what he has said,</br>My Husband he'll be by his Stile,</br>And when he once asks me to wed,</br>Oh!  I'll not let him wait a great while!</br>"]
