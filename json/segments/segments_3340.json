["Ye Muses!  who in Fonthill's groves reside,</br>Break your sweet harps, and to the woods complain:</br>Let mournful echo catch your deep-fetch'd sighs,</br>And the sad sound convey to th' distant plain;</br>Where Britain's genius dwells, and let her know</br>That all her joys are fled, her triumphs turn'd to woe.", "Beckford is dead!  the great, the god-like man!</br>Britannia's noblest son is now no more,</br>Who like a bulwark stood, to guard those rights</br>Which crown'd with freedom Britain's happy shore.</br>Fame hangs her trump with jetty black, and mourns the day,</br>When Beckford's noble soul forsook its humbler clay.", "Britannia weeps!  revers'd her ensigns fall!</br>Fair Freedom's lambent glory sinks and fades!</br>Who now, she cries, will wake at freedom's call,</br>Or guard those laws which tyranny invades.</br>Must Britain's far fam'd glory fall!  Must I,</br>Forc'd from my antient seat, to barb'rous nations fly!", "When lo!  an angel, clad in white, appears,</br>Sent from th' aetherial mansions of the sky;</br>Fear not, he cries, your darling Beckford wears</br>An everlasting crown of light on high.</br>When his great soul burst from its mounds of clay,</br>Myriads of angels led it to the realms of endless day.", "And know, that Heaven has said, be England free!</br>Against her, Tyranny shall ne'er prevail;</br>Tho' clouds awhile her glory may oppose,</br>The cause of liberty shall never fail:</br>But awful Justice guard Britannia's laws,</br>And Wilkes and Townsend be what Beckford was.</br>"]
