["What grievous ills our daily patience prove!</br>A prince's frown grieves him that longs for power;</br>Dry slumbers grieve the swain that prays a shower;</br>But most grieves me, the frown of her I love!</br>As early larks mount high to hail the dawn;</br>As waiting levees crowd the great man's gate;</br>So all my longing thoughts impatient wait,</br>Till Delia's presence bless the flow'ry lawn!</br>When she appears, my eyes with rapture glow;</br>My heart beats high with transports all refin'd;</br>Methinks some vision of celestial kind,</br>Hath come to make a heaven on earth below!</br>She speaks: &mdash; the nymphs a modest silence keep!</br>She sings: &mdash; the warbling groves are hush'd and still!</br>No more is heard the thrush or woodlark's trill,</br>And a deep calm o'erspreads the listening deep!</br>No other shepherdess like her can charm!</br>More heavenly-good, or more excelling-fair!</br>Her smiles alone can soften all my care!</br>And my sad breast with endless rapture warm!", "As angry storms still vex the murmuring deep,</br>As weeping dews still fall from evening-skies,</br>So ne'er shall cease my heart with woe to weep,</br>Or briny tears to fill my mournful eyes!</br>Then why should I so fondly-foolish prize</br>Or aught in Love's or Fortune's fickle train!</br>Since these are changeful as the rolling main,</br>More brittle than the reed that breaks in twain,</br>More vain than autumn's leaf that quivering flies</br>The sport of winds! &mdash; so vain are all my joys!</br>Poor wretch, thus doom'd to Sorrow's endless tear!</br>Full sad the woes that must for ever flow,</br>Till life's fair light itself I last forego,</br>And all my joys and woes lie buried in the bier!", "I dream'd that Love had bless'd my humble bower!</br>I dream'd that Fortune had at last been kind:</br>Alas!  'twas but a dream: &mdash; my golden store,</br>And lovely mistress dear, I no where find!</br>I wake with anguish, grieve my pensive mind,</br>To see my golden dreams with darkness fly;</br>Nor bear the look of day now beaming high!</br>&mdash;Me woeful wight!  what now shall soothe my heart,</br>Thus left with empty pouch, and scanty bread?</br>While all my airy dreams, far off, depart,</br>And want and penury hang o'er my head?</br>Why, lo! &mdash; I weep all day, and wait the night;</br>Then wrap me in my pallet, dreaming still</br>Of lovely mistress kind, while guineas fill</br>My purse; thus then I'm happy till returning light!</br>"]
