["I'll pluck, sweet Love!  another flow'r for thee,</br>(If poesy have flow'rs my hand may reach:)</br>While Spring remains, in ev'ry bloom I see,</br>There's that which to my sadden'd heart doth teach,</br>More than the loftiest orator could preach!</br>Leaf follows leaf, and flower succeeds to flow'r,</br>And nature sheds on all, her smile and tear:</br>On the fresh rose alike, and her whose hour</br>Is past; whose relics lie on their cold earthy bier.", "Yes!  the pale sever'd leaf partakes the dews</br>That nurse the expanding bud, the ripen'd bloom;</br>Nor mine the niggard breast that can refuse</br>Thy share of love, tho' mould'ring in the tomb:&mdash;</br>Thee, summer suns shall never more illume,</br>But tears shall fall, and sighs for thee shall heave,</br>And warm in mem'ry's bed I'll cherish thee,</br>Till this fond bosom lose the pow'r to grieve,</br>And earth's brief joys and cares, alike forgotten be!", "Yet mourn I not, as those of hope bereft,&mdash;</br>Blest hope!  that consecrates the Christian's dust:</br>Sad, but not comfortless, my soul is left;&mdash;</br>Father of Love!  I know in whom I trust;&mdash;</br>My pious child rejoices with the just!</br>He who on little children deigned to lay</br>His blessed hands, and called them heirs of heav'n,</br>Forbids a doubt to cloud my lonely way&mdash;</br>Her infant pray'rs were heard!  O be my tears forgiv'n.</br>"]
