["Come, sprightly Goddess, fair and blithe,</br>With eyes of azure blue,</br>Who gently skimm'st the fleeting air,</br>With robe of motley hue;", "O!  lull me on the snowy breast</br>To soft enchanting sleep,</br>For on thy bosom Care's beguil'd,</br>And Woe forgets to weep.", "Borne on thy wing the cot I've view'd,</br>The flow'r-enamel'd mead;</br>Heard Philomela's plaintive moan,</br>And Shepherd's vocal reed:", "The desert wild, the craggy rock,</br>And dashing surge I've seen,</br>Th' mould'ring tow'r, and blasted heath,</br>By Luna's lambent beam.", "On Avon's banks I've trac'd the stream,</br>Where swans divide the wave,</br>In whose delightful bosom they</br>Their downy pinions lave.", "To Heav'n I oft have wing'd my way,</br>Where worlds eternal roll,</br>There trod the spangl'd pavement o'er,</br>And rov'd from pole to pole.", "Come then, thou Goddess, heav'nly fair,</br>With thee, O!  let me live;</br>With smiling Mirth let me partake</br>Those joys which thou can'st give.</br>"]
