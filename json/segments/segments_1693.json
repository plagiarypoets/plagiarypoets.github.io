["James Hogg is tuneful, and James Hogg is clever,</br>And this praise to James Hogg I'll award ever;</br>For Kilmeny is lovely, and Mary Scott beautiful,</br>And splendid the tale of Mackinnon undutiful:</br>But James Hogg is scornful, and James Hogg is taunting,</br>And fill'd, in his \"Pilgrims,\" with insolent vaunting;&mdash;</br>His \"Pilgrims,\" forsooth, an uncouth wild farrago,</br>Which, propp'd by the critics, its course awhile may go.</br>Now vaunting's a vice that all merit defaces,</br>The higher the genius the more it debases;</br>Yet vaunting degrades this poetical shepherd,</br>No lion of verse, but a dark-spotted leopard;</br>For, while Scotia he praises, he England defames,</br>And Dryden and Pope with perversity blames,</br>And says that, moreover, no harp of her own</br>Has England to grace her poetical throne;</br>As tho' he'd forgot the great bards of our clime&mdash;</br>Our Chaucers, our Spensers, our Miltons sublime,</br>And our wonderful Shakespeares, &mdash; a genius-struck throng,</br>The lords of our verse, and the giants of song!</br>Each one of which four &mdash; and I say it with pride&mdash;</br>Is worth all the poets of Scotland beside,</br>However high they may boast their poetical lot,</br>From the days of their nonage to fam'd Walter Scott.", "But this Hogg, not contented to tarnish our glory,</br>By placing above it his Scotch-mountain story,</br>In prejudiced drivel not to be outdone,</br>Descends in vulgarity down to a pun,</br>And talks of a \"crabbe\" that crawls on the shore</br>Mid the reptiles of rhyme that write but for ore,</br>('Tis true that in Scotland no poet delights</br>In exorbitant sums for the lays that he writes);</br>Then says, Muse of England, play truant with me,</br>And forsake the long lanes and dark sinks of the sea.", "Could the shepherd of Ettrick but blush for the act</br>That aught from the merit of Crabbe would detract,</br>Whose pictures of nature will never decay</br>Till existence shall change, and the world melt away;</br>And could he for once but take shame for the strain</br>That descants on fair England with pride and disdain&mdash;</br>Gifted England, by either Minerva upborne,&mdash;</br>Then the Muse may forgive him his vaunting and scorn.</br>"]
