["Ye Powers of Hell!  no coward's is my soul&mdash;</br>Of old I proved it. &mdash; Who the forces led</br>That shook Jehovah's throne above the pole?</br>Who with Ithuriel coped? &mdash; the thunders dread</br>Of the Omnipotent? &mdash; Who, when ye fled,</br>Followed by wrath and flame, &mdash; who waked ye first</br>From that infernal lake, your burning bed,</br>To fell revenge?  Who dared alone the worst,</br>And through the void obscure, from out the prison burst?", "Who brought ye o'er the unfathomable abyss,</br>To this delightful world, and bade ye reign?</br>Mine was the peril &mdash; yours possession, bliss&mdash;</br>I won &mdash; and ye enjoyed the new domain,</br>The thrones that totter now &mdash; then who  shall stain</br>My valour, chiefs, with doubt that I would lose</br>Tamely the power I had such toil to gain?</br>Yon treacherous fiend? &mdash; what he!  shall he traduce</br>The strength of Satan's Sword, who breathes but by abuse&mdash;", "Lives but on death &mdash; on the defenceless preys&mdash;</br>Who sucks the blood of infants &mdash; doth delight</br>But in ignoble cruelty, and sways</br>Unequal strife? &mdash; Away!  thou bane of fight!</br>Who shunn'st the day, and lurkest for the night,</br>To hover like a cormorant, o'er the plains,</br>And feed upon the flesh of wounded knight,</br>And drench the last drop from his bleeding veins,</br>And greatly triumph o'er a hero's dying pains!", "True bravery is from rashness as remote</br>As trembling hesitation, O my peers!&mdash;</br>Then be our counsel cool, and calm our thought,</br>Not warped by fury, nor subdued by fears;</br>That Resolution, stedfast as the spheres,</br>Fixed &mdash; fierce as Hell &mdash; our purposes may rear!</br>The time which lost us Heaven by proof declares,</br>Than Power is His who doth the thunder bear,&mdash;</br>But Subtlety is ours &mdash; we are his equals there!</br>"]
