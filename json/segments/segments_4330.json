["Return, O lov'd Strephon return,</br>Nor fly thus thy once belov'd maid,</br>Ah will you then leave me to moan</br>And is my fond heart thus betray'd?", "The garland you wove for my hair,</br>It withers and droops on my head,</br>Yet still the lov'd gifts I will wear,</br>Tho' its beauty and fragrance are fled.", "When in the calm moment of eve,</br>I by the clear rivulet stray,</br>Still for thy dear presence I grieve</br>And mourn for you all the long day.", "If e'er through the woodland I rove</br>Or under the willow recline,</br>My thoughts still revert to thy love,</br>Still for thy departure repine.", "The grotto where oft your sweet song</br>Has rivall'd the birds of the spring;</br>Now alas!  the lov'd grott is forlorn,</br>No mirthful ideas can bring.&mdash;", "The bow'r has no pleasure for me</br>No more can I visit the grove,</br>I fear you are like to the bee</br>Which careless and heedless does rove.", "Unhappy I fly to the lawn,</br>The scene but increases my pain,</br>Or wretched at day's early dawn,</br>I wander forlorn on the plain.</br>"]
