["I.</br>Thy muse may tell, how, when at labor's close,</br>To meet her love, beneath the twilight shade,</br>O'er many a broom-clade brae, and heathy glade,</br>In merry mood the village maiden goes.</br>There, on a streamlet's margin as she lies,</br>Chanting some carrol till her swain appears;</br>With visage deadly pale, in pensive guise</br>Beneath a wither'd fir his form he rears.</br>Shrieking and sad, she bends her speedy flight,</br>When mid dire heaths, where flits a taper blue,</br>The whilst the moon sheds dim a sickly light,</br>The solemn funeral meets her blasted view.</br>When trembling, weak, she gains her cottage low,</br>Where Magpies scatter notes of horror wide,</br>Some one shall tell, while tears in torrents flow,</br>That just when twilight dimm'd the green hill's side,</br>Sunk in his airy shiel, her hapless shepherd died.", "II.</br>Let these sad strains to lighter sounds give place;</br>Bid thy brisk viol warble measures gay:</br>For see, recall'd by thy resistless lay,</br>Once more the Brownie shews his honest face.</br>Hail from thy wanderings long, my much-lov'd sprite,</br>Thou friend, thou lover of the lowly, hail!</br>Tell in what realms thou sport'st thy merry night,</br>Trail'st the long mop, or whirlst the mimic flail.</br>Where dost thou range the much-disorder'd hall,</br>While the tir'd damsel in Elysium  sleeps;</br>With early voice to drowsy workman call,</br>Or lull the dame, while mirth his vigils keeps?</br>'Twas thus in Caledonia's domes, 'tis said,</br>Thou ply'dst the kindly task in years of yore:</br>At last, in luckless hour, some pitying maid,</br>Spread in thy nightly cell of viands store.</br>Ne'er was thy form beheld among their mountains more.", "III.</br>Then wake (for well thou canst) that wondrous lay,</br>How, when around the thoughtless matrons sleep,</br>Soft o'er the floor the treach'rous Faeries creep,</br>And bear the smiling infant far away.</br>How starts the nurse, when, for her lovely child,</br>She sees at dawn a gaping ideot stare!</br>O snatch the innocent from demons wild,</br>And save the parents fond from fell despair!</br>In a deep cave the trusty menials wait,</br>Till, from their hilly dens, at midnight's hour,</br>Forth prance the airy elves in pompous state,</br>And o'er the moonlight heath with swiftness scour.</br>In armour bright the little horsemen shine;</br>Last, on a milk-white stead with targe of gold,</br>A fay of might appears, whose arms entwine</br>The lost lamented child:  the shepherds bold</br>Th' unconscious infant tear from his unhallow'd fold.</br>"]
