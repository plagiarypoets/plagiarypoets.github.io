["As DICKY a languishing Swain,</br>Sat pensive alone in a Grove;</br>Thus mournfully told he the Pain,</br>His Heart felt in Absence and Love.</br>Alas how uneasy am I,</br>How lumpish and dull is my Heart!</br>It knows not a Corner of Joy,</br>But sorrows in every Part.", "For PEGGY, my fair one, is gone,</br>She's gone, and has left me behind;</br>Where plaintively lying alone,</br>I joyn the sad wispering Wind.</br>Each murmuring Blast that comes near,</br>I fill with soft Notes of my Pain:</br>The Grottos my Murmurings hear,</br>And sadly re-murmur again.", "But all is in vain, silly Lad!</br>For PEGGY perceives not thy Moan:</br>She sees not thy Coutenance sad,</br>Nor knows thou art mourning alone.</br>Perhaps now her DICKY'S forgot,</br>And a Youth that's more happy than he,</br>Possesses her with a soft Thought,</br>Or clasps in his Arms on his Knee.", "And should it be so, can I blame</br>A Nymph that's so charming as she?</br>She ne'er was design'd for a Swain,</br>So mean, and so wretched as me.</br>Her Form is too lovely and bright,</br>Too much to an Angel refin'd;</br>To stoop to so humble a Wight,</br>Or center so lowly her Mind.", "How silly was I, and how wild,</br>To wish for so mighty a Prize!</br>To let my poor Heart be beguil'd,</br>And pant in the Warmth of her Eyes!</br>She suffer'd my Pride to advance,</br>And heard what my Bosom could say;</br>She smil'd, and I dy'd in a Trance;</br>She spoke, and I melted away.", "O had she not been so divine!</br>Or else more severe to her Swain!</br>O had better Fortune been mine!</br>Or else had not I been so vain!</br>Then DICKY perhaps had been blest</br>In a Nymph more befitting his State:</br>Or known no dull Weight on his Breast,</br>Nor mourn'd the hard Laws of his Fate.", "But rapt with his PEGGY, still he</br>Long Days of Delight had enjoy'd;</br>From doubts and from Jealousies free,</br>Nor Absence his Bliss had destroy'd.</br>Alas, ye deluding dear Hours,</br>That slipt in short Moments away,</br>When PEGGY and I blest the Bow'rs,</br>And call'd you and begg'd you to stay!", "You're gone, and no more will return,</br>And Ages your Places supply;</br>In Moments I find Years to mourn,</br>Tho' Years fled in Moments of Joy.</br>How swiftly can Pleasure bear Time,</br>How shortly flit Ages away!</br>How dully Despair can confine,</br>And clogg a whole Age in a Day!</br>"]
