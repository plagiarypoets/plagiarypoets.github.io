["SPENSER*.</br>ELEGIAC.</br>Like as a Huntsman, after weary chace,</br>Seeing the Game from him escape away,</br>Sits down to rest him in some shady place</br>With panting Hounds beguiled of their prey:", "So, after long pursute and vain assay</br>When I long weary had the chace forsook</br>The gentle Deer return'd the self-same way</br>Thinking to quench her thirst in the next brook:", "2.</br>Then She, beholding me with milder look,</br>Sought not to flee, but fearless still did bide:</br>Till I in hand her, yet half trembling, took</br>And with her own good will her firmly tide.</br>Strange thing me seem'd to see a Beast so wild</br>So goodly won; with her own will beguil'd.", "* This Sonnet, if I recollect, is beautifully set by GREEN.</br>C.
