["Here high suspended on a gibbet hangs</br>A youth to ev'ry vice and plunder prone,</br>Till caught at length by Law's resistless fangs,</br>He found his thieving occupation gone.", "Bad were his sentiments, his actions worse,</br>And when he mounted Newgate's fatal drop,</br>He gave the hangman a most hearty curse,</br>From him he got, what he deserv'd, a rope.</br>"]
