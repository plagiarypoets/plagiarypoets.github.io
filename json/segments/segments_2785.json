["Thou know'st, my Salust, when in hoarded heaps</br>The miser's chest the glittering coin receives,</br>Sullen, and dim, and valueless it sleeps;</br>Gay circulation all its beauty gives.</br>Ah!  then it shines attractive on the thought,</br>Rises, with such resistless influence fraught,</br>As puts to flight pale Fear, and Scruple cold,</br>Till life, ev'n life itself, becomes less dear than gold.", "Conscious how strong this charm, thy honour'd name,</br>Brave Proculeius!  Rome, with zeal, adores;</br>The chief, who bade his ruin'd brothers claim</br>A filial right in all his well-earn'd stores.</br>To make the good deed deathless as the great,</br>With trembling plumes, that dread Icarian fate,</br>This record Fame, of her high trust aware,</br>Shall long on cautious wing solititously bear.", "And thou, my Sallust, more complete thy sway,</br>Restraining the insatiate lust of gain,</br>Than shouldst thou join, by conquest's proud essay,</br>Iberian hills to Libya's sandy plain;</br>Than if the Carthage sultry Afric boasts,</br>With that which smiles on Europe's lovelier coasts,</br>Before the Roman arms, led on by thee,</br>Should bow the yielding head, the tributary knee.", "See bloated Dropsy added strength acquire,</br>As the parch'd lip th' incessant goblet drains!</br>Indulgence feeds th' unsatisfied desire,</br>That the pure blood with aqueous fluid stains;</br>Nor can exhausted floods that thirst subdue,</br>Till the dire cause, which spreads the livid hue,</br>O'er the pale form, with watry languour swell'd,</br>From the polluted veins, by medicine, be repell'd.", "Virtue, whate'er the babbling vulgar dream,</br>Denies Phraates, seated on the throne</br>Of mighty Cyrus, joy's internal gleam;</br>And thus she checks the crowd's mistaken tone:</br>\"He, only he, who, calmly passing by,</br>Not once shall turn the pure, unwishing eye</br>On heaps of massy gold, that near him glare,</br>My amaranthine wreath, my diadem shall wear!\"</br>"]
