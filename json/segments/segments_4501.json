daine all Westward to decline.", "MONTANUS.</br>Ah (Coridon) unmeet is melody</br>To him whom proud contempt hath overborn,</br>Slain are my joyes by Phoebus bitter scorn,</br>Far hence my weale and nere my jeopardy.", "Loves burning brand is couched in my brest,</br>Making a Phoenix of my faintfull hart:</br>And though his fury doo inforce my smart,</br>Ay blyth am I to honour his behest.", "Preparde to woes since so my Phoebe wils,</br>My lookes dismaid since Phoebe will disdain,</br>I banish blisse and welcome home my pain,</br>So stream my tears as showers from Alpine hils", "In errors maske I blindfold judgements eye,</br>I fetter reason in the snares of lust,</br>I seeme secure, yet know not how to trust,</br>I live by that, which makes me living dye.", "Devoyd of rest, companion of distresse,</br>Plague to my selfe, consumed by my thought,</br>How may my voyce or pipe in tune be brought?</br>Since I am reft of solace and delight.", "CORIDON.</br>Ah Lorrell lad, what makes thee Herry love?</br>A sugred harme, a poyson full of pleasure,</br>A painted shrine ful-fild with rotten treasure,</br>A heaven in shew, a hell to them that prove.", "Againe, in seeming shadowed stil with want,</br>A broken staffe which follie doth upholde,</br>A flower that fades with everie frostie colde,</br>An orient Rose sprong from a withred plant.", "A minutes joy to gaine a
