["Ah!  who shall declare my distress?</br>Shall I call for the aid of the Nine?</br>Nor they nor their God can express</br>An anguish so cutting as mine!</br>Have my eyes not discover'd my woe?</br>Or are her's to their language so blind?</br>Nay &mdash; looks are too feeble to shew</br>The cruel despair of my mind!", "Stern nature, to blast my repose,</br>And banish all hopes of my ease,</br>No charms on my person bestows,</br>Nor aught on my form that can please:</br>While fate's unrelenting decree</br>To deepen my misery strove,</br>By giving me eyes that could see,</br>By giving an heart that could love.", "Soon, soon shall she quit the gay scene&mdash;</br>Sing poets in fanciful lay,</br>How her absence has darken'd the plain,</br>How the shrubs and the flow'rets decay:</br>How the sweet gushing riv'let is dry,</br>That murmur'd so softly along&mdash;</br>&mdash;And I too will join you &mdash; but I</br>Will give truth to the fabulous song.", "For, ah!  with what truth may I sing</br>How the flow'r of my hope is decay'd:</br>And how, in life's earliest spring,</br>My blossoms of happiness fade!</br>And how the sweet fountains of joy,</br>That water'd my fancy all o'er,</br>Those fountains, eternally dry,</br>Shall flow, and shall murmur no more!</br>"]
