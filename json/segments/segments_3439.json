["Ye Shepherds attend to my strain,</br>Attend to my woe and despair;</br>Your sorrows will lessen my pain,</br>And your pity alleviate my care:</br>Then I'll throw, all distress'd and forlorn,</br>My pipe and my numbers aside;</br>For the sun that enlighten'd this morn,</br>Saw Delia, gay Corydon's bride.", "For him the bright Goddess of dawn</br>Enliven'd with crimson the skies,</br>And for him o'er the sad dusky lawn</br>The shades of pale eve will arise:</br>On Damon no Comfort must shine,</br>While Corydon joy waits on thee;</br>And the night which to bliss you consign,</br>Brings Anguish and Horror to me.", "Ah, Delia!  my foolish fond heart</br>Your beauties unknowingly stole;</br>And without the resources of art,</br>Unheeding you conquer'd my soul:</br>Your charms were the joy of my sight,</br>O'er each feature my raptur'd eye run;</br>You was fair, and I gaz'd with delight!</br>You smil'd, and my heart was undone!", "So pleasing, so sweet was the pain,</br>And my mind could no danger foresee,</br>That with transport I bow'd to the chain,</br>And never once wish'd to be free:</br>Too late my pass'd error I prove,</br>For alas!  now I feel to my cost,</br>That when Damon submitted to Love,</br>His peace and his pleasures were lost.", "But Shepherds, let Delia ne'er know</br>The pangs I am doom'd to endure,</br>Lest a drop from her bright eyes should flow,</br>For sorrows she never must cure:</br>Better thousands, like Damon distress'd,</br>In silence those sorrows should bear,</br>Than one sigh swell my Delia's soft breast,</br>Or her cheek feel the weight of one tear.", "Ye Woods and ye Meadows adieu,</br>My Flocks are dispers'd on the plain;</br>My woes now, young Shepherds, ye view,</br>Then attend to the close of my strain.</br>When Love first your bosom alarms,</br>The too pleasing poison ah shun!</br>She was fair, and I gaz'd on her charms!</br>She smil'd, and my heart was undone!</br>"]
