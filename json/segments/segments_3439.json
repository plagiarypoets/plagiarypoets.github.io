["Sweet Eve, of softest voice and gentlest beam,</br>Say, since the pensive strains thou once didst hear</br>Of him, the bard sublime of Arun's stream,</br>Will aught beside delight thy nicer ear?</br>Me wilt thou give to praise thy shadowy gleam,</br>Thy fragrant breath, and dying murmurs dear;</br>The mists that o'er thee from the vallies stream,</br>And elfin shapes, that round thy car appear;</br>The music that attends thy state; the bell</br>Of distant fold; the gently warbling wind,</br>And watch-dog's hollow voice from cottag'd dell?</br>For these to purest pleasure wake the mind,</br>Lull each tumultuous passion to its cell,</br>And leave soft soothing images behind.</br>"]
