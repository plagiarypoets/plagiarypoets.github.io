["Return, blest years! &mdash; when not the jocund Spring,</br>Luxuriant Summer, nor the amber hours</br>Calm Autumn gives, my heart invok'd to bring</br>Joys, whose rich balm o'er all the bosom pours;</br>When ne'er I wish'd might grace the closing day,</br>One tint purpureal, or one golden ray;</br>When the loud Storms, that desolate the bowers,</br>Found dearer welcome than Favonian gales,</br>And Winter's bare, bleak fields, than Summer's flowery Vales!", "Yet, not to deck pale hours with vain parade</br>Beneath the blaze of wide-illumin'd Dome;</br>Not for the bounding Dance; &mdash; not to pervade,</br>And charm the sense with Music; &mdash; nor, as roam</br>The mimic Passions o'er theatric scene,</br>To laugh, or weep; &mdash; O!  not for these, I ween,</br>But for delights, that made the heart their home,</br>Was the grey night-frost on the sounding plain</br>More than the Sun invok'd, that gilds the grassy lane.", "Yes, for the joys that trivial joys excell,</br>My lov'd HONORA, did we hail the gloom</br>Of dim November's eve; &mdash; and as it fell,</br>And the bright fire shone cheerful round the room,</br>Dropt the warm curtains with no tardy hand;</br>And felt our spirits, and our hearts expand,</br>Listening their steps, who still, where'er thy come,</br>Make the keen stars, that glaze the settled snows,</br>More than the Sun invok'd, when first he tints the rose.", "Affection, &mdash; Friendship, &mdash; Sympathy, &mdash; your throne</br>Is Winter's glowing hearth; &mdash; and ye were ours,</br>Thy smile, HONORA, made them all our own.&mdash;</br>Where are they now? &mdash; alas!  their choicest powers</br>Faded as they retreat; &mdash; for thou art gone,</br>And many a dark, long Eve I sigh alone,</br>In thrill'd remembrance of the vanish'd hours,</br>When storms were dearer than the balmy gales,</br>And Winter's bare bleak fields than green luxuriant vales.</br>"]
