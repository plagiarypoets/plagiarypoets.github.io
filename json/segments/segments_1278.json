["STROPHE.</br>What shrieks burst thro' the darken'd air!</br>The dismal sounds I hear again!&mdash;</br>Ah!  see, encircled by this baleful train,</br>The black, grim-visag'd Genius of Despair!", "Yonder he stands!  Around him wait,</br>In all the pomp of sullen state,</br>Remorse and Guilt, whose troubled breast</br>Hope's flatt'ring gales ne'er lull to rest;</br>While Conscience acts the Torturer's part,</br>And gnaws with venom'd stings their heart.</br>And there, while Danger's giant form</br>Stalks thro' the horrors of the hurtling storm,</br>(Whose howl what mortal unappall'd can hear?)</br>Shivers aghast the phantom Fear.</br>There Madness too, whose shatter'd hair,</br>Wildly streaming mocks the air;</br>His bloody eye-balls sparkle fire,</br>And burst with ineffectual ire.</br>While still by fits he shakes his hundred chains,</br>Or grins a ghastly laugh, or roars along the plains.", "ANTISTROPHE.</br>By the transient gleams of light</br>I see what yet escap'd my sight!</br>I see a self-devoted band,</br>Each holds a poniard in his hand;</br>Despondence marks each downcast face,</br>And sad Reflection's gloomy trace.</br>With banning voice, that rends the sky,</br>They call  Despair:  Despair is nigh</br>Far from the realms of chearful day</br>The night-born chieftain leads the way.</br>High on yon cliff's tremendous brow,</br>That shades the gulf of Death below,</br>Awhile they stand:  Hell's ravening brood,</br>In one harsh scream their joy declare;</br>(The sound still vibrates on my ear.)</br>Prelusive lightnings dart around,</br>And bellowing thunders shake the ground.</br>Amidst the elemental shock</br>They deeply strike the sudden blow;</br>Then plunge impetuous from the rock,</br>And sink beneath th' o'erwhelming tide below.</br>"]
