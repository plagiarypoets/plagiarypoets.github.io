["Oh!  it is sweet, in this disjointed age,</br>To 'scape awhile life's sad realities,</br>Where history weeps o'er the recording page</br>Of human crimes and human miseries!</br>From want, from war, th' enfranchis'd spirit flies&mdash;</br>How gladly flies!  how mournfully returns!</br>Still in that southern isle embower'd lies,</br>Hiding 'mid palmy groves, and glistening burns,</br>And England's stormy skies and wilder discord spurns.", "Still fancy lingers there, to contemplate</br>The lovely scene, enamor'd of her theme!</br>Connubial love, most blissful draught of fate,</br>Mix'd with no rancourous tear, or jealous dream,</br>Pure, unpolluted, as the crystal stream,</br>Perfect, as joy in Eden's happy vale;</br>And peace, content, and piety's mild beam,</br>Gild with refulgent light the verdant dale,</br>A softer music breathe, and load the ambient gale.", "Home, wanderer, home, again!  The spell is past,</br>Which lur'd thee, fancy, to that southern isle;</br>The silent lyre from the high plantain cast,</br>Unvocal now, no longer would beguile</br>A gentle lady's tear, or critic's smile.</br>Fancy, why lingerest thou?  Thy pleasing pain</br>Is all gone by; remain and rest awhile;</br>Again perchance to wake the echoing strain</br>With firmer, bolder hand.  Home wanderer, home again!</br>"]
