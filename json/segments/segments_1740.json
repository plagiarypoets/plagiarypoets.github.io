["The things which circle round an evening fire,</br>The sage, by turns, will envy and despise;</br>They look no farther than the day's desire,</br>And daily life possesses in their eyes</br>Such interest and importance, as supplies</br>The cravings of all thought, and to the brim</br>Fills up the measure of their faculties;</br>They feel their being in each healthful limb,</br>No cheek is pale with thought, no eye with study dim.", "Theirs is that better wisdom which can reap</br>Joy or content from every passing hour;</br>They smile and know not why, or if they weep,</br>Their tears are transient as a summer shower.</br>What are to them the passions, and their power?</br>Their hate is folly &mdash; their love idleness&mdash;</br>In Misery's hovel or in Pleasure's bower,</br>Scarce wakes the torpid heart; yet not the less</br>They in their petty world hope, fear, torment, and bless.", "&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;", "Here the spruced lover, with a fond grimace,</br>Turns tenderly to some sweet simpering she;</br>Calls up a rapture in his foolish face,</br>And stares on hers with apelike ecstacy.</br>Ah!  happy pair, may ye for ever be</br>Happy as now!  for me, I would not shake</br>Your trusting faith in Love's divinity;</br>Too happy, if the spell may never break.&mdash;</br>If bliss be but a dream, why should we ever wake?", "Here \"lovely Woman\" has the homage due;</br>The \"softer sex!\" that bright and angel throng!</br>Some have seen faults, &mdash; (Swift's Strephon saw some too)</br>Yet have they graced each amorous harper's song,</br>Have been be-goddessed and be-graced so long,</br>That Heaven forbid, I of their praise should stint them,</br>True, I've some notions &mdash; but perhaps 'twere wrong&mdash;</br>So though in conversation I might hint them,</br>Nothing shall e'er induce the modest Muse to print them.</br>"]
