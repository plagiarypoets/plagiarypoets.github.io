["How sweet the moon beyond yon hamlet peeps,</br>And tips with silver all the distant trees;</br>How sweet she rises, now all nature sleeps,</br>And lulls the drowsy peasants into ease!", "How still the air, how solemn is the scene,</br>How form'd for contemplation's mighty pow'r!</br>Mark how yon light that glimmers o'er the green,</br>Peeps thro' the crevice of yon ruin'd tower.", "Here in this little spot, a num'rous heap,</br>Of friends and foes together lie forgot!</br>Here the forefathers of the village sleep</br>In peace, and leave mortality to rot!", "Here wealth and poverty together lie,</br>Each mould'ring 'neath his own respective sod;</br>Know, man, we all alike are born to die,</br>To live, to sin, then dwindle to a clod!", "No titles, rank, or dignity claim place,</br>The grave no vain distinction gives to birth;</br>Here rests in peace, the clown beside his grace,</br>Each in the bosom of his mother earth!", "Ah!  what avail the gewgaws of the day,</br>The vain illusions of an idle hour?</br>Say, shall we not all soon be call'd away,</br>To yield that life, which withers like a flow'r!", "Beneath this turf a little infant lies,</br>Freed from the anxious miseries of life:</br>Sleep on, sweet innocent, thy lot's a prize,</br>To leave a world of folly, care, and strife!", "Yet we that live perhaps should think it hard,</br>To quit the world, its pleasures unenjoy'd:</br>Still when we taste them, where's the great reward?</br>Pleas'd for the moment, discontent and cloy'd.", "Perhaps beneath this earth on which I tread,</br>Some ancient noble warrior lies conceal'd;</br>Whose name's forgot amongst the num'rous dead,</br>Whose fame unletter'd ne'er will be reveal'd!", "But hark!  the village clock now warns me hence,</br>And bids me from this simple lesson learn,</br>How man's short life, how little is his sense&mdash;</br>From dust he sprung, to dust he must return!</br>"]
