["Young Damon's the brightest of all the gay swains,</br>'Tis he who has won my fond heart,</br>'Tis he of whose falseness each maiden complains</br>Each maiden for him feels the smart.", "Alas how bewitchingly sweet he appears,</br>When low at my feet he does lye,</br>And whispers so softly those words in my ears</br>Oh Silvia, for you I must die.", "I fain with disdain would his passion repel,</br>But still I attempt it in vain,</br>Since my eyes interpret my heart but too well,</br>Too well they its wishes explain.", "Ah, surely 'tis malice, my shepherd's bely'd,</br>I say to myself with a sigh,</br>The envious nymphs would our passion divide,</br>And leave me to sorrow and dye.", "What, tho' he to Molly has prov'd insincere,</br>The maid whom he once much admir'd,</br>Yet Molly so wanton and loose did appear</br>That her lovers she always has tir'd.", "But why did he Lucy the lovely deceive,</br>That charmer of every eye?</br>Ah, how could he leave the sweet virgin to grieve,</br>To languish, to suffer, and dye?", "Oh!  why was he formed so outwardly fair,</br>Thus finish'd with every grace,</br>So matchless his shape, so noble his air,</br>And adorn'd with each beauty his face.", "In accents so tender his love he declares,</br>And presses me oft to comply,</br>His torture's so great, he ardently swears</br>That unless I relieve him he'll die.", "His speeches, like poison, thrill thro' all my veins,</br>And much I'm inclin'd to believe,</br>Ah, Silvia, beware, for thy lover but feigns,</br>His pleasure is till to deceive.", "Which way shall I go, his addresses to shun?</br>To what distant plain must I fly?</br>How wretched's the maid who is each way undone</br>For refusing or granting I dye.</br>"]
