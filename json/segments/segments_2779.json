["Celestial Sympathy divine!</br>Do thou illumine every line;</br>Teach me to feel another's woe;</br>And bid my verse with thee to glow.</br>Let thy soul-soft'ning, pleasing pow'r,</br>Beguile each lonely, lingering hour;</br>Oh, let me know thy form serene,</br>For all enchanting is thy mien.</br>Thy lovely influence impart,</br>To soften, to subdue my heart.</br>Oh!  if my wandering footsteps stray,</br>Where Misery holds her hateful sway,</br>Where Sorrow's saddening scenes surround,</br>That place where Penury is found;</br>Where loving parents, sunk with Care,</br>In all the sadness of Despair,</br>To Heaven with supplications pray,</br>\"O give my children bread to-day!\"</br>Where the fond mother, woe-deprest,</br>Seems hastening to the realms of rest,</br>While round her helpless infants cry,</br>And view their much-lov'd parent  die;</br>Teach me such miseries to relieve,</br>And health and peace to such retrieve.", "When Sympathy exalts the mind,</br>Our sentiments e'er seem refin'd;</br>It softens, melts, expands our hearts,</br>And every finer sense imparts.", "Often at eve's cool hour I stray,</br>And listen to Philomel's lay;</br>And then bemuse a limpid rill,</br>While all around is hush'd and still,</br>Attend, delighted, to her song,</br>Which sounds the wood-land green along:</br>Her plaintive notes enchant my ear,</br>And from my eyes draw forth a tear.</br>But oh!  'tis by thy pleasing aid,</br>Soft Sympathy, enchanting maid!&mdash;</br>Then, lovely Nymph, so fair, so soft,</br>Do thou my feelings lift aloft;</br>And when I view pale Sorrow's face,</br>And all the pangs of anguish trace,</br>To me with beaming beauty haste,</br>And let my soul thy influence taste.</br>"]
