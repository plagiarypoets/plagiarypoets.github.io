["I.</br>Thou!  who didst beam upon the mighty soul</br>Of Pindar, Majesty of song,</br>Whose numbers like the mountain's torrent roll,</br>That shakes the rocks around, and loudly roars along;</br>Deignst thou to aid a youth of little praise?</br>Deignst thou to aid my unexalted lays?</br>Thyself my yet untutor'd verses sing;</br>Assist me, radiant native of the sky,</br>A bolder song let Fancy try,</br>A bolder flight, O!  teach my feeble wing.", "II.</br>Say, hast thou seen the hallow'd shrine before?</br>When princes trembled, and a nation pray'd,</br>When spoke great PHOEBUS by the Delphic maid,</br>Keen from her eyes the livid lightning flew,</br>While all her bosom with the godhead burn'd,</br>In broken throbs her labouring breath she drew;</br>The God!  the God!  nor could she utter more,</br>The God!  the God!  in loud response the vaulted fane return'd.", "III.</br>So heav'd the bosom of the Theban bard,</br>Swell'd with the thought inspir'd by thee,</br>Hark!  the sound sublime is heard!</br>So flash'd his eye, so shook his frame,</br>When thy big spirit like a whirlwind came</br>Upon the fiery wing of boundless ecstasy.", "IV.</br>Who's he, with blooming chaplet crown'd,</br>Cull'd from the bed of every gayest flower?</br>While the jocund harp around</br>The swelling grapes their rich nectar pour:</br>Hear the all-delightful measure,</br>Breathing joy, and breathing pleasure;</br>Love, with rosy-blushing wing,</br>Nimbly strikes the dancing string,</br>And lists with dimpled smile to every joyous sound.", "V.</br>Yet looks he not with mournful eye</br>To where pale Sappho's spectre glides along.</br>What tho' her lyre the willow-cover'd maid</br>Taught the sweet note of plaintive philomel?</br>In vain her lyre, in vain her song;</br>On Phaon's scorn no plaintive notes prevail.&mdash;</br>The snowy swans with all their music die,</br>And leave the languid strains to Echo's murmuring shade.", "VI.</br>See the Latian poet rise,</br>Nor less with Attic fire to raise</br>The lofty verse, nor less to chear</br>With pleasure bland the social hour,</br>Whether he sung a Caesar's praise,</br>Or Lalage's sweet-smiling eyes,</br>Or, Bacchus, thine enlivening power,</br>To poets and to lovers ever dear,&mdash;</br>The Arts' great master pour'd the artless lay,</br>Or bade his Art sublime no meaner art betray.", "VII.</br>Didst thou not visit ALBION, maid divine,</br>In ancient song of Druid or of Bard,</br>When in the deep recess or gloomy grove,</br>From hallow'd oaks prophetic sounds were heard?</br>Or if to Woden when the dance they wove</br>Did the rude chorus in rude music join?</br>Yet sure on Cowley, heaven-born muse,</br>Did thine gathered beams diffuse,</br>Thou mark'dst him from the meaner throng;</br>Cowley, who bade the conscious heart rehearse</br>The bolder thought in less harmonious verse,</br>In all the soaring power of eagle genius strong.", "VIII.</br>Hadst thou not smil'd on SCOTTISH plains,</br>Where flows sweet Yarrow, or the winding Tweed?</br>The shepherds boast not of thy loftiest strains,</br>Yet whilom tun'd the careless reed,</br>In praise of rural nymphs, the rural swains;</br>Or sung their native scenes, the limpid rill,</br>The sunny bank, the broom-embroidered hill,</br>Where stock-doves courted in the tenderest coo:</br>Such artless song thou gav'st the shepherd's pipe to woo.", "IX.</br>If e'er to modern days</br>Descend thy genuine lays,</br>Thee Collins, hapless Collins did possess:</br>Curdles my blood in every vein,</br>Fear, with all his ghastly train,</br>Danger with his giant-stride,</br>Murder fell, and Ruin wide,</br>On my thick-beating heart tumultuous press&mdash;</br>That Pity, with her dewy lighted eyes,</br>Curs'd be the wretch his memory who denies,</br>Which erst he bade in numbers soft to flow,</br>And pluck'd the cypress wreath for yet another's woe.", "X.</br>Thou too didst aid the pensive Gray,</br>And bad'st the solemn verse that sung</br>His requiem to the village-hind,</br>Rise to thy sublimer lay.</br>See where the bard on Fate's dread summit hung,</br>And loose his gray locks wav'd upon the hollow wind.</br>Nor less the palms that crown thy Mason's brow,</br>Nor less the palms for Ogilvy that grow.", "XI.</br>Say, wilt thou bid one fainter ray</br>To light my humble genius stray?</br>I ask no tow'ring fame,</br>No high emblazon'd name;</br>Thine be the care to gild the vacant hour,</br>And bid the sluggish moments smoother roll;</br>Thine be the blissful power,</br>In dangerous pleasure, or in grief severe,</br>To prompt the moral smile, the moral tear,</br>To aid my song, nor less to aid my soul.</br>"]
