["Ah, gentle Edmund, when thy ditties sweet,</br>Belinda, music's Philomela, sings,</br>Raptur'd, I own the harmony complete,</br>Sweet poesy, sweet fair, sweet voice, sweet strings.", "Ah poet worthy, of such minstrelsy;</br>Soft minstrelsy such poet meriting;</br>'Midst chill neglect, I wot, and penury,</br>Thou, Edmund, woud'st have joy'd to hear her sing,", "For, well I ween, that melody can bring</br>Composure soft and tranquil, to the mind;</br>Since I (tho' in nought else thee equalling)</br>Yet who, like thee, cold praise, and barren find,</br>Can all my ills forget these strains to hear,</br>Oh then, dear harmonist, indulge a prayer,</br>Sing on; and lull to sleep that triple Cerberus, Care!</br>"]
