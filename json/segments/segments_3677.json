["O Susquehana's banks, where timber brash</br>Slumps in the flood with many a hideous crash,</br>Where boatable, she pours her waters bland</br>Thro' prairies green, and muggy bottom-land,</br>And waters in her course the sloshy swamp</br>That yields sweet meals of succotash and samp,</br>Two guessing Yankies met, slang-whangers both,</br>And men of gumption they, and nothing loth</br>To squale loose jaw, and slam an angry oath;</br>One a backwoodsman, who with axe and glut</br>Had built himself a handsome clapboard hut;</br>The other was a squatter, who was bent</br>From off his neighbour's land to tote a cent;</br>Both kedge and sprigh, and men that in a scrouge</br>Could jeopardize their foes, and neatly gouge.</br>Leaving his chore, thus the backwoodsman spoke:", "BACKWOODSMAN:</br>So, Jonathan, a very pretty joke!</br>Are then my bottom-lands so rich and fat,</br>That you must come and on my prairie squat?</br>Once in a while it perhaps were no great matter,</br>To give some mush to some poor likely squatter;</br>But you're too clitchy, so I must confess</br>I fain would obligate you to a progress.", "SQUATTER.</br>Progress!  you think a squatter may be trounced,</br>And patiently from post to pillar jounced.</br>But I'm a Yankee too, and to your loss</br>I'll shew you speedily you're not my boss,</br>Is't not enough to waste my strength and cunning,</br>Trying to get a scanty meal by gunning,</br>Wading thro' dismal swamps, and nearly spent,</br>But you must grudge your countryman a cent?</br>I'd have you know it's well I ask no more,</br>For Mister Jackson, when he gets the floor</br>In Congress, tells us that we all are men</br>And every Yankee is a citizen.</br>CAETERA DESUNT.</br>"]
