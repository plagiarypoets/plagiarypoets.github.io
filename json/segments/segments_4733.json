["Thy real friends, O Liberty!</br>Must gaze on France with ecstacy,</br>Must hold that day for ever dear</br>Which clos'd a despot's proud career,</br>Must venerate the wondrous deed</br>Which millions from their shackles freed&mdash;</br>Which shews the world's anointed things,</br>How puny, when oppos'd, are kings,</br>And which, in terms all powerful, bids mankind,</br>Burst their degrading chains, and be what heaven design'd.", "Yes!  Liberty, thy friends sincere</br>Must Gallia's dauntless sons revere,</br>And tho' a vain, a worthless crew,</br>With tythe and benefice in view,</br>Should far and wide their slanders fling</br>And raise the cry of \"Church and king,\"</br>Tho' chapels blaze, tho' mansions fall,</br>And one vast ruin frown on all;</br>Yet undismay'd, they still defend thy cause,</br>Still brand the tyrant's sway, and Britain's partial laws.", "Let the infuriate rabble rise</br>And awful flames illume the skies;</br>Let priests exultant eye the blaze,</br>Then to the mob deal pence and praise&mdash;</br>Let magistrates, with snail-like haste</br>Attempt to stay th' infernal waste?</br>Let pious &mdash; such deeds to check,</br>From justice screen the ruffians neck;</br>Such wrongs as these but sprinkle Freedom's fire,</br>And speed that grand reform, which patriots' souls desire!</br>"]
