["Oh Thou!  whose viewless form, slow-stealing Time!</br>Has silent march'd o'er many a conquer'd year!</br>Shall thy chill pow'r pervade the glowing rhyme?</br>Shall thy rude hand each tuneful record tear?</br>Shall genius raise aloft the soul-fraught strain,</br>And swell the choral tide of Heav'n-taught verse in vain?", "Tho' ages past have own'd thy tyrant sway,</br>Tho' many a wreck the spoiler's power reveals,</br>Beneath thy scythe, tho' empires pass away,</br>And countless charms the unconscious grave conceals;</br>Tho' o'er the laurel'd brow the dusky tomb</br>In sullen silence sheds its deep impervious gloom&mdash;", "Not with his ebbing breath the poet dies!</br>He lives, he speaks to ages yet unborn!</br>Then boast not Time!  thy earthly mould'ring prize&mdash;</br>Well may the Bard thy envious efforts scorn;</br>Ne'er shall his triumphs to thy sway belong,</br>All hail'd by distant years, immortal in his song.", "Direct thy glance beyond life's fragile hour,</br>Oh Seward!  lov'd of the Aonian Nine!</br>On thy full gaze bid all the future pour,</br>And raptur'd, see the admiring future thine!</br>See laurels bloom, thy shadowy brow to wreathe,</br>Hear bards yet uncreate, an aweful tribute breathe.", "For not to thee with niggard hand assign'd,</br>The short-liv'd triumph of some local strain!</br>Thine the proud empire of the enthusiast mind,</br>Thine, the fine chords which swell to pleasing pain,</br>To joy's tumultuous throb, to mystic fear,</br>To friendship's bosom glow, or pity's hallow'd tear.", "Lo!  where the oral Muse of former time,</br>By thee invok'd, in gothic state descends,</br>With potent hand awakes the runic rhyme,</br>And the thick veil of dark oblivion rends!</br>See from the tomb the fateful weapon wave!</br>Oh cease the mutter'd rite!  respect the secret grave!", "To drop soft dews on beauty's wither'd flower,</br>From the full breast to urge the slow-heav'd sigh,</br>Or bid descend the tributary shower</br>To wet the turf where worth and valour lie,</br>Snatch Fame's bright banner from the grasp of Time,</br>O'er the illustrious dead to wave its folds sublime.", "The generous task be thine!  Lo!  Andre's shade,</br>With flight indignant quits the murd'rous shore!</br>Spirit of song!  instruct the matchless maid,</br>Teach her sweet pity's seraph strain to pour,</br>Bid the sad tale descend to latest years,</br>Enbalm'd to time remote, in friendship's tuneful tears.", "What nameless thousands crowd life's little day,</br>Minions of sordid wealth or pageant pow'r,</br>Born but to sport in fortune's gilded ray,</br>The weak ephemera of a sunshine hour!</br>E'en Memory o'er their urns forgets to weep;&mdash;</br>For them how dark the tomb!  the oblivious grave how deep!", "And are those eyes but meteors of a day?</br>Doom'd is that hand in mould'ring dust to sleep?</br>Those eyes, whence Genius pours his living ray,</br>That hand, so skill'd the Muse's lyre to sweep?</br>And shalt thou vanish with the vulgar throng?</br>How drear the sullen pause when hush'd thy heavenly song!", "No, Seward!  Tho' those orbs shall cease to roll,</br>When the freed spirit seeks her native skies,</br>Still in thy verse survives celestial soul!</br>Oh!  not with Seward's form her memory dies!</br>Still shall thy song enraptur'd fancy bind,</br>Still breath the sacred fire of unextinguish'd mind!", "Then, Seward, live till Time itself shall close,</br>Nor mourn mortality's promiscuous doom,</br>Since Death in vain his dreaded ice-bolt throws,</br>To blast the laurel Genius bids to bloom.</br>Lift to thy Muse the soul-enkindled eye&mdash;</br>She grants a glorious boon &mdash; 'tis Immortality.</br>"]
