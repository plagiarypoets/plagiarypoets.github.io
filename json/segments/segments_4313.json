["My Lucy was charming and fair,</br>Love shot every shaft from her eyes;</br>So sweet, so commanding her air,</br>It could soften, at once, and surprise;</br>Such pity, such tenderness play'd,</br>Serene, in her face, in her mind!</br>But the vision of hope is decay'd,</br>Though the shadows still linger behind.", "My flute was melodious and soft,</br>The joy of the pastoral throng,</br>The linnet would join from aloft,</br>And Lucy embolden the song;</br>My cheeks (which pale sorrow will fade)</br>Were the red rose and lilly combin'd,</br>But the vision of hope is decay'd,</br>Though the shadows still linger behind.", "Past pleasures no more shall beguile,</br>Sad dreams rend the pinions of sleep,</br>When I look on her beauty, I smile,</br>When I look on her scorn, I must weep.</br>Ungrateful!  what vows hast thou made,</br>Vows, fickle and false as the wind,</br>The vision of hope is decay'd,</br>But its shadows still linger behind.", "Ah!  fair as the blossoms of spring,</br>Ah!  how could that bosom be sold?</br>More love lay in Corydon's ring,</br>More wealth, than in Floridel's gold.</br>The dotard now wooes my sweet maid,</br>Now feels ev'ry rapture refin'd,</br>The vision of hope is decay'd,</br>But its shadows still linger behind.", "No more to my flocks will I sing,</br>No more tend the cells of the fold,</br>No more shall the glad vallies ring,</br>Since affection is barter'd for gold.</br>I will fly, with despair to some shade,</br>I will die, on some rude rock reclin'd,</br>The vision of hope is decay'd,</br>And naught but its shadows behind.</br>"]
