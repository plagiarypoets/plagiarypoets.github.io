["While the torn vessel stems her lab'ring way,</br>Ere yon blue hills sink ever from my view;</br>Let me to sorrow raise the tribute lay;</br>And take of them my long, my last adieu.", "Adieu!  ye walls; thou fatal stream farewel;</br>By war's sad chance beneath whose muddy wave</br>Full many a gallant youth untimely fell,</br>Full many a Britain found an early grave.", "Beneath thy tide, ah!  silent now they roll,</br>Or strew with mangled limbs thy sandy shore;</br>The trumpet's call no more awakes their soul!</br>The battle's voice they now shall hear no more.", "In vain the constant wife and feeble sire,</br>Expectant wish their lov'd return to see;</br>In vain their infants' lisping tongues enquire,</br>And wait the story on their father's knee.", "Ah!  nought avails their anxious, busy care;</br>Far, far, they lie, on hostile seas they fell;</br>The wife's, sire's, infant's joy no more to share,</br>The tale of glorious deeds no more to tell.", "Learn then, ye Fair, for others woes to feel,</br>Let the soft tears bedew the sparkling eye;</br>When the brave perish for their country's weal,</br>'Tis pitys debt to heave the heartfelt sigh.", "Ah!  glorious DRAKE!  far other lot was thine,</br>Fate gave to thee to quell the hostile pride;</br>To seize the treasures of POTOSI'S mine,</br>And sail triumphant o'er LA PLATA'S tide.", "But Providence, on secret wonders bent,</br>Conceals its purposes from mortal view;</br>And Heaven, no doubt with some allwise intent,</br>Deny'd to numbers what it gave to few.</br>"]
