["Why vainly bid the animated bust,</br>Why bid the monumental pile to rise?</br>Too often Genius doomed by fate unjust,</br>Unnoticed lives, unwept &mdash; unhonour'd dies!", "Too oft the Poet, in whose sacred breast</br>With ardour glow the Muse's purest fires,</br>Contemned by pride, by penury opprest,</br>In anguish lives, and in neglect expires!", "Too oft, alas!  in some sequester'd ground,</br>Silent and cold, the Poet's ashes sleep;</br>No pomp of funeral is seen around,</br>No kindred Bard to praise, no Friend to weep!", "Such, BRUCE, the feelings in my breast that rise,</br>While guided by the Muse, I wander near;</br>Mark the lone spot where youthful Genius lies,</br>And give thy fate the tribute of a tear.", "Obscure thy birth, yet in thy early breast</br>How deep and ardent glow'd the Muse's flame;</br>How strongly in thy bosom was imprest</br>The Poet's genius, and the Poet's fame!", "Such was thy mind, but, ah!  upon thy frame</br>Disease relentless urg'd its envious way;</br>Fled was each joy of health, each hope of fame,</br>And thou the victim of a slow decay.", "Like some fair flower, that owes the desert birth,</br>Whose buds foretel the beauty of its prime,</br>That sinks unsheltered, sinks unseen to earth,</br>Chilled by the blast, or cropt before its time.", "Perhaps thus blasted by unfriendly doom,</br>Thy genius foster'd in a milder air,</br>Matur'd by age, in all the pride of bloom,</br>Had spread luxuriant, and had flourish'd fair!", "But, ah!  no more the Poet now remains,</br>Cold is the breast that glow'd with sacred fire,</br>Mute is the tongue that flow'd in tuneful strains,</br>Check'd is the hand, and silent is the lyre!", "For him, who now laments thy early tomb,</br>Like thee inspir'd with youthful love of lays,</br>Though now he mourn, he soon may share thy doom,</br>May soon require the tribute which he pays.</br>"]
