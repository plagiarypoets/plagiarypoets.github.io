["Reclin'd in a vernal alcove,</br>Sat Sylvia, bemoaning her fate;</br>For Strephon had slighted her love,</br>And chang'd all his fondness to hate:</br>\"Ah!  why am I doom'd thus to mourn?\"</br>(Replied the sweet maid with a sigh)</br>\"How hard is my case to be borne?</br>What mortal's as wretched as I?", "\"O!  Strephon, thou cause of my grief,</br>Cease, cease, cruel swain to torment,</br>Ah!  give your poor Sylvia relief,</br>And fill her sad soul with content:</br>Remember, that once you was kind,</br>No shepherd excell'd you in mien;</br>But now you're as false as the wind,</br>And your love is converted to spleen.", "\"Tho' oft you have vow'd on the plain,</br>You'd ever be constant and free;</br>Nay more, you were won't to explain,</br>Yet still you are faithless to me.</br>By the side of the sweet silver stream,</br>That glides thro' yon neighbouring vale;</br>Ah!  there you first made me your theme,</br>And I listen'd with joy to your tale.", "\"But now what a change do I find,</br>Nor solace, nor comfort I know;</br>Since thou art to me so unkind,</br>I'm wretched wherever I go:</br>For woe in my breast is replete,</br>Should death then my fortune betide;</br>O!  tell each kind swain that you meet,</br>'Twas doating on thee that I died.\"", "Thus spoke the dear nymph in soft strains,</br>While silent the birds hopp'd the spray;</br>In solitude still she remains,</br>And pines all her hours away.</br>Ye fair that adorn this bright Isle,</br>Be guarded against such a snare;</br>On man be not eager to smile,</br>Lest the fate of poor Sylvia ye share.</br>"]
