["DAMON.</br>Why sits deep despair on thy brow?</br>Why stands the round tear in thine eye,</br>And why, for I hear'd it e'en now,</br>Heav'd thy bosom that sorrowful sigh?", "CORYDON.</br>Is yet then my Damon to know</br>The source whence my sorrows are fed?</br>Then hearken &mdash; and share in my woe,</br>Dorinda &mdash; Dorinda is dead!&mdash;", "DAMON.</br>Ah, me!  Is the bounteous no more?</br>Weep in anguish, ye nymphs and ye swains!</br>What heart can restrain to deplore</br>The loss of the pride of our plains?", "CORYDON.</br>Last night of her death nought aware,</br>As close by her folds I return'd,</br>Harsh blasts from her flocks fill'd the air,</br>Ah, me!  'twas their mistress they mourn'd!", "DAMON.</br>Full cause had her flocks to bewail</br>The death of Dorinda the good,</br>She led them each morn to the vale,</br>When thirsty, she drove to the flood.", "CORYDON.</br>And when the grey ev'ning approach'd,</br>She lodg'd them secure from their foes,</br>In the folds (where no prowlers encroach'd,</br>To lose the long night in repose.", "DAMON.</br>Nor was it for lucre she fed</br>The tribes that enwhiten yon green;</br>The hungry still shar'd of her bread,</br>To the naked her fleeces were giv'n.", "CORYDON.</br>A tribute of tears shall be paid,</br>Shall flow to her praise from each eye,</br>And sighs from each bosom shall aid,</br>To waft her pure soul to the sky.", "DAMON.</br>The stone shall stand at her head,</br>Shall speak this indelible strain,</br>\"Here lies &mdash; for Dorinda is dead&mdash;</br>The glory, the pride of the plain.\"</br>"]
