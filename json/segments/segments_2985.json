["Still were the Groves, and venerable Night</br>O'er half the Globe had cast her gloomy Veil,</br>When by a Taper's solitary Gleam</br>Sat musing Mira pensive and along;</br>In her sad Breast officious Memory</br>Reviv'd the Pictures of departed Friends,</br>Whose pleasing Forms she must behold no more.</br>Forgotten Woe, that for a time had slept,</br>Rose into Life, and like a Torrent pour'd</br>On her faint Soul, which sunk beneath its Rage:</br>At length soft Slumber kindly interven'd,</br>And clos'd those Eye-lids that were drench'd in Tears;</br>But restless Fancy that was waking still,</br>Led my deluded Spirit on the Wing</br>To pictur'd Regions and imagin'd Worlds.", "I seem'd transported to a gloomy Land,</br>Whose Fields had never known the chearful Sun:</br>A heavy Mist hung in the frowning Sky,</br>No feather'd Warblers chear'd the mourning Groves,</br>Nor blushing Flow'rs adorn'd the barren Ground:</br>I gaz'd around the solitary Coast,</br>When lo a Nymph was solemn Air approach'd,</br>Whose Dress was careless and her Features grave,</br>Her Voice was broken and her Hearing dull:</br>She spoke but seldom, yet at last she told</br>Me in a Whisper, that her Name was Thought;</br>And more, she offer'd, with a friendly Air,</br>To lead me safely through the dreary Gloom:</br>We walk'd along through rough unpleasing Paths,</br>O'er Beds of Night-Shade and through Groves of Yew,</br>Till we arriv'd within a dusky Wood,</br>Whose spacious Bound was fenc'd with shagged Thorn.</br>The Trees were baleful Cypress; and a few</br>Tall Pines that murmur'd to the rushing Wind:</br>Here dwelt the Natives, (mournful as the Place)</br>Or sunk in real or imagin'd Woe;</br>Complaining Sounds were heard on ev'ry Side,</br>And each bewail'd the loss of something dear:</br>Some mourn'd a Child that in its Bloom expir'd,</br>And some a Brother's or a Parent's Fate:</br>Lost Wealth and Honours many Tongues deplor'd,</br>And some were wretched, tho' they knew not why.", "But as we reach'd the Centre of the Place,</br>Complaints were heard more piercing than before:</br>The gathering Fogs grew thicker o'er our Heads,</br>And a cold Horror thrill'd our wounded Souls,</br>And thus we travell'd, pensive beyond measure,</br>Through Paths half cover'd with perplexing Thorns;</br>At length we found two Rows of aged Firs,</br>Whose Tops were blasted by unwholsom Winds.</br>This solitary Vista op'ning wide,</br>Disclos'd the Palace of its mournful Queen:</br>Before the Gate was plac'd a frightful Guard,</br>Who serv'd as Porters to the gloomy Dome:</br>Here, stretch'd upon a miserable Couch,</br>Lay pining Sickness with continual Groans;</br>And by her Side, (array'd in filthy Weeds)</br>Sat quaking Poverty with ghastly stare:</br>His Presence seem'd to aggravate her Pain,</br>For when she cast her languid Eyes on him,</br>She hid her Face and rais'd a fearful Cry.</br>There Disappointment like a Statute stood,</br>With Eyes dejected and with Visage pale:</br>Her heaving Bosom seem'd to swell with Anguish,</br>And in her Hand she grasp'd a broken Reed:</br>Here, in the Garb of Piety, we saw</br>Proud Error frowning with a Look severe:</br>Doubt at his Elbow bore a Rod of Snakes,</br>And held a Cup fill'd to the Brim with Tears,</br>By these we pass'd into the dusky Court,</br>O'er-run with Hemlock and with gloomy Fern:</br>Perpetual Night hung o'er the dismal Walls,</br>And from the Ground unhealthy Vapours rose;</br>Through folding Doors of Ebony we came,</br>Into a winding Passage hung with black,</br>For ever dark &mdash; possest by flitting Shades,</br>By waking Fancies, and by frightful Dreams</br>This led us to a subterraneous Cell,</br>Where the sad Empress Melancholy reign'd;</br>The musing Matron sat upon a Throne</br>Of mould'ring Earth &mdash; her Footstool of the same;</br>And for her Canopy an aged Yew</br>Spread o'er her Head its venerable Arms:</br>Her careless Robe was of a sable hue,</br>And on her Shoulders flow'd her slighted Hair:</br>Her Lips were clos'd with an eternal Silence;</br>Her Arms were folded and her Head reclin'd;</br>On either Side her pale Attendants stood,</br>Two mournful Maids, Dejection and Despair;</br>The first (attended with continual Faintings)</br>Seem'd on the Point to close her dying Eyes:</br>A constant Dew hung on her death-like Brow,</br>And her cold Bosom half forget to heave.</br>Despair (whose Garments by herself were torn)</br>Was mark'd with Wounds that Time can never heal:</br>With desp'rate Hand she struck her bleeding Breast,</br>And wash'd the Ground with never-ceasing Tears;</br>With ghastly Figures was the Cave adorn'd,</br>And in the midst the Effigies of Death.", "Shock'd at the Place we hasted to return,</br>And left the horrid Mansion far behind;</br>Long time we travell'd through untrodden Paths,</br>Where the brown Forests cast an awful Gloom:</br>At length the floating Clouds began to part,</br>And left behind them Streaks of chearful Azure;</br>Our Path grew smooth and widen'd to the view,</br>Until it open'd on a spacious Field;</br>A Field whose Charms no Painter e'er cou'd reach,</br>Though he shou'd borrow form the Poet's Heav'n;</br>The Clime was temp'rate and the Air was still,</br>The spouting Turf was of a beauteous Green,</br>Speckled with Flow'rs of a delicious Dye.</br>Here crystal Lakes were border'd round with Trees,</br>Where Blossoms flourish'd in eternal Spring;</br>For here the Groves no blasting Tempests know,</br>But still are blest with Fruits that ne'er decay:</br>Perpetual Sun-shine crown'd the gaudy Hills,</br>And the fair Vallies were with Plenty gay.", "A Path there was, trod o'er the spicy Field,</br>Which led the Wand'rer to a blissful Shade,</br>Whose Fence was made of balmy Eglantine;</br>Where the fair Plane o'erlook'd the Myrtle Shrub,</br>And flow'ring Orange that perfume the Air;</br>Here flew in Throngs the soft aerial Choir,</br>Whose glitt'ring Necks like polish'd Amber shone:</br>We pass'd delighted through ambrosial Paths,</br>And Bowers move with Jessamine and Rose;</br>Joy seiz'd the ravish'd Spirits, while we breath'd</br>In Gales that tasted of immortal Sweets.", "At length the parting Trees broke into Form,</br>And with a Circle bound a charming Plain,</br>I' th' midst of which upon an Iv'ry Throne</br>Sat Chearfulness, the Genius of the Place:</br>Her Mien was graceful and her Features fair;</br>Continual Smiles dwelt on her dimpl'd Cheeks,</br>Her Hair was bound beneath a shining Crown,</br>Her Robes were Azure bright with golden Stars,</br>And in her Hand she held a silver Lute.", "On either Side her royal Sisters sat,</br>Both lovely, as herself, tho' not so gay;</br>The eldest had a Face divinely fair;</br>Calm was her Look, with Lips prepar'd for smiling,</br>She often rais'd her thankful Eyes to Heav'n;</br>Her Form was easy and her Name Content:</br>The other (much the youngest) was array'd</br>In Virgin Robes white as unsully'd Snow;</br>Her thoughtless Smiles wou'd tame a Tiger's Rage,</br>A Lamb (whose Neck was circl'd with a Band</br>Of new-blown Roses) at her Feet was laid,</br>A milk-white Dove upon her Hand she bore:</br>Thus ever blest sat Innocence the fair.", "Behind these Sisters stood a shining Train,</br>As Maids of Honour to the Royal Fair:</br>Prosperity (the first) was climbing up</br>A stately Pyramid of painted Marble;</br>From whose high Top she reach'd a brilliant Crowd:</br>Then with an Air that spoke a joyful Heart,</br>Look'd down with Pleasure on the Plain below.", "Gay Wealth the next, in her embroider'd Vest,</br>Shone like the Entrails of the eastern Mine;</br>Her Hair was platted thick with sparkling Gems,</br>And in her Hand she bore a golden Wand.", "Health, like a Sylvan Huntress cloath'd in Green,</br>In her right Hand a dapled Palfry held,</br>Her Air was masculine, and swift her Motion;</br>A Wreath of Flow'rs just ravish'd from the Meads,</br>Bound up the Ringlets of her sable Hair;</br>Her Cheeks were ruddy;
