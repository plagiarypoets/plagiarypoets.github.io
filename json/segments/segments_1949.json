["Now sinks the blushing god of parting day,</br>And westerly clouds with golden splendour stream,</br>And forward crowd, as 'twere to catch the ray,</br>That lingers on his last and loveliest beam;</br>How regular and radiant do they seem!</br>And pensive evening, from the eastern sky,</br>Softens the fire of day-light's flaring gleam</br>With sombre shadows &mdash; to the mind-fraught eye,</br>More sacred and more sweet than morning's richest dye.", "The evening walk, how pure and pleasing!  See</br>The sportive children crowd the hamlet green:</br>The circling elders mark the playful glee,</br>And proudly tell of times when they had been,</br>And famous feats and fortunes they had seen;</br>The squatted dames deal village scandal round,</br>In council grave; the sly girl eyes the scene</br>Of striving youths, to catch the sight, the sound</br>Of him for whom her heart's best purest beatings bound.", "Now day recedes, and modest twilight spreads</br>Her veil of darkness o'er the blushing skies,</br>Through which the waking night, soft peeping, sheds</br>The twinkling radiance of ten thousand eyes</br>On air's blue page the seal of silence;</br>Repose, on earth, has laid her hushing wing;</br>Tired Ocean sleeps, nor hears the soft sad sighs</br>Of wooing winds; the world seems slumbering;&mdash;</br>So motionless and mute each dead and living thing!</br>"]
