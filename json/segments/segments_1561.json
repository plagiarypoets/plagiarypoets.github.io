["Here, in a gloomy grove, some little space,</br>From this fair castle, by a streamlet's side,</br>Where waving pines still sound a sullen base,</br>And water murmurs, as it down doth glide,</br>A goodly chapel there was edified.</br>Thither to wend, full many a sonne did use,</br>Them good man sexton, who doth there abide,</br>When in they entered been, eftsoons immews,</br>Silent, in very dark, and well y-cushioned pews.", "Then chaplain sleek, up to his pulpit creeps,</br>A fat round body, and broad face he had,</br>(He many feasts, I wis, but few fasts keeps,)</br>Yet of his cheer, he seemed too solemn sad.</br>He was, in sooth, a drowsy stupid lad,</br>The rewdest ass, our castle's crew among,</br>He prankt his band, and then the people bade</br>Praisen the lord, by singing holy song,</br>So clerk it raised high, now sing it all the throng.", "When this had tuned them to sweet repose,</br>Sir Sanctity gan preche of . . . reprobation.</br>He spake of mystic grace, which straungely flows,</br>On wight unworthy of justification,</br>Much hath he talked, and of predestination;</br>Still he repeteth what he said afore,</br>And still he crieth out . . . regeneration.</br>And still he coughs, and spitteth on the flore,</br>And every sentence hems, both after and afore.", "As in some wealthy yeoman's well-stored yard,</br>Where fowl of every various kind abound,</br>The gaudy peacock for his plumage spar'd,</br>The valiant cock whose voice doth early sound;</br>The careful hen with ducklings all around,</br>The strutting turkey, and the meek-eyed dove.</br>At even tide, perchance a flock is found,</br>Of simple geese, sound sleeping, while above,</br>Waketh one cackling goose . . . thus slept we in that grove.</br>"]
