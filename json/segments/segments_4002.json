["How fresh does the morning appear,</br>The musick how sweet from the grove,</br>Oh!  how blest is the swain that is clear</br>From the pains of unsatisfied love.</br>No slumber these eyes ever knew,</br>Whilst Phoebe remain'd unpossess'd;</br>From friends and companions I flew,</br>A stranger to friendship and rest.", "My sheep, by their shepherd forsook,</br>Lag, pent in their fold till mid-day,</br>Whilst I by the side of a brook</br>Would complain the dull hours away.</br>Not all the gay flowers of the field,</br>Whose sweetness perfum'd the soft air,</br>A joy to my senses could yield,</br>Unless the lov'd Phoebe were there.", "Alas!  silly swain, how I burn'd,</br>Sure passion like mine ne'er appear'd;</br>When absent, her absence I mourn'd,</br>When present, her absence I fear'd.</br>But now all this folly is o'er,</br>Since Phoebe to me has prov'd kind,</br>I sigh and I languish no more,</br>But contentment in every thing find.", "Full joy in her presence I have,</br>But her absence now breaks not my rest;</br>For with her dear person she gave</br>Me her heart, to lock up in my breast.</br>Oh!  how chearful my flocks now I guide,</br>At noon where to taste the fresh streams,</br>Whilst I sing to the tune of Tweed side,</br>On the pleasanter banks of the Thames.</br>"]
