["Danger, and Death, the dread alarms</br>That scowl around a falling state,</br>Nor civil feuds, nor hostile arms,</br>Nor Tyranny's oppressive weight,</br>Can tame the free-born mind that draws</br>Its glory from a just applause,</br>Or bend its stubborn virtue down,</br>To court the favouring glance, or shun the stern indignant frown.", "Tho' Victory waves her crimson wings</br>Triumphant o'er th' embattled foe,</br>Each death-defying warrior springs</br>With force collected to the blow;</br>And while aghast the timid band</br>Of Pleasure's fluttering vot'ries stand,</br>A bolder energy they feel,</br>And with redoubled ardour grasp the keen avenging steel.", "Thus high aloft when clouds deform</br>Yon azure heavens, the bird of Jove</br>Plumes his bold pinions in the storm,</br>And proudly scorns the sheltering grove:</br>For not beneath the flowery spray,</br>His new-fledg'd wings were taught to play,</br>But from the rock-built aerie's height,</br>On thunder-driving blasts to dart their uncontrolled flight.", "Nor sordid Hope, or slavish Fear,</br>Or Flattery's sweetly-soothing smile,</br>Or lures from Favour's glittering sphere,</br>Their steady souls can e'er beguile:</br>The high-plum'd trappings they deride,</br>Of new-blown Honour's bloated pride,</br>And thro' the loftier paths of Fame,</br>Where rang'd their great Patrician Sires, at lasting glory aim.", "Such were the sons of Albion seen,</br>When bursting from a hostile yoke,</br>Led on by an insulted Queen,</br>The Romans bow'd beneath their stroke:</br>And tho' by Fate compell'd to yield,</br>Each toil-proof Hero unsubdu'd,</br>And panting with redoubled rage, th' unequal war pursued.", "To Freedom's cause severely true,</br>They brav'd the phalanx'd veteran train;</br>With frantic zeal to slaughter flew,</br>Nor unrevenged press'd the plain.</br>While Victory astonish'd stood,</br>'Midst hills of carnage, seas of blood,</br>Nor dar'd to grasp the doubtful prey,</br>Tho' low beneath her trophy'd car BRITANNIA'S glory lay.", "Thus rough from Nature's forming hand,</br>Like diamonds glowing from the mine,</br>Our hardy Sires recorded stand,</br>And stern in savage virtue shine.</br>To twang the bow, to dart the spear,</br>To guide aloft the flying car,</br>To stem the torrent's foaming tide,</br>Or with the sounding thong inflame the racer's generous pride.", "These were the manly sports they knew;</br>By these their sinewy limbs were strung,</br>And, nurs'd in arms, to vigour grew,</br>Firm as the chiefs from whom they sprung.</br>Nor did the Muse, harmonious maid,</br>Disdain to haunt their acorn'd shade,</br>But oft amidst the Druid quire,</br>She hymn'd the war-stain'd Hero's praise to her immortal lyre.", "Yet trembling, oft she dropp'd the shell,</br>And half unfinish'd left her song,</br>Scar'd from the dark remorseless cell,</br>When fierce-eyed Fury lash'd her thong:</br>Or when on WODEN'S rock-rais'd shrine,</br>The hopes of many a glorious line,</br>For virtue, and for arms renown'd,</br>The victims of misguided Zeal, his blood-stain'd altars crown'd.", "From reeking groves to rural shades,</br>By Druid rituals undefil'd,</br>Calm vales, and pine-incircled glades,</br>She fled, a blushing wood-nymph wild;</br>'Till Peace her olive sceptre sway'd,</br>And back recall'd the wandering maid,</br>To tune her melting lute again,</br>And temper Virtue's rigid soul with feelings more humane.", "Soon infant Science rear'd her head,</br>The clash of arms was heard no more;</br>No more the hostile sails were spread,</br>To waft invasion to the shore.</br>Great ALFRED, father of his Isle,</br>Bade Arts arise, and Commerce smile;</br>While bending to his gentle yoke,</br>The realm by petty tyrants torn, its feudal fetters broke.", "Yet half subdued, each Gothic horde,</br>Unaw'd by weaker sceptres, came;</br>Again they lift the conquering sword,</br>Again their Pagan altars flame:</br>While unprotected Science fades,</br>Obscurely sunk in monkish shades,</br>Nor dares unfold her towering plumes,</br>Immers'd in Slaughter's sanguine streams, and Superstition's glooms.", "'Till bright ELIZA'S happier reign,</br>From papal power emerging, rose,</br>Dispers'd the cloister's dronish train,</br>And rous'd her from her dull repose:</br>Then glow'd with more than Attic fire,</br>Great SHAKESPEAR'S soul-consuming lyre;</br>And Truth divine, from SPENSER'S tongue,</br>Diffus'd her sacred precepts, couch'd in allegoric song.", "Then flourish'd many a glorious name,</br>To fire the rapture-breathing Muse,</br>And lift her to those heights of fame,</br>The venal Bard in vain pursues.</br>For such the just decrees of Jove,</br>The flowery wreaths by Falsehood wove,</br>Soon withering lose their gaudy prime,</br>While Truth's fair garlands mock the blasts of Envy, and of Time.", "Nor shall the flattering Minstrel claim</br>A Poet's praise, whose sordid views</br>Absorbs the Muse's generous flame,</br>In Adulation's blighting dews.</br>Mark o'er time-serving WALLER'S tomb,</br>How faint the tarnish'd laurels bloom.</br>Mark DRYDEN'S loftier genius bend,</br>Repentant of that servile part distress can ill defend.", "Then turn to yon majestic shrine,</br>Where MILTON'S awful bust displays</br>Impartial Candour, Truth divine,</br>Inform'd by Judgment's bright'ning rays.</br>Turn, and revere his honour'd shade,</br>Who no inglorious aims betray'd,</br>But firm, and resolutely just,</br>Defy'd Ambition's gilded baits, or Passion's wavering gust.", "Abash'd!  ye slaves whose hireling rhymes</br>Pollute celestial Virtue's name,</br>Or vindicate a Villain's crimes,</br>Or fan Sedition's dangerous flame;</br>There drop your prostituted style,</br>Nor e'er for purposes so vile</br>Presume to stain the sacred page,</br>With specious Flattery's glossing lies, or Envy's rancorous rage.", "Yet while by Falshood's impious quire</br>Debas'd, the blushing Muse complains,</br>On MASON'S truth-directed lyre</br>She breathes her purest, chastest strains;</br>Round DARCY'S bower the palm she rears,</br>For CA'NDISH civic wreaths prepares,</br>And bids her favourite Bard relume</br>The plausive song, that erst proclaim'd his virtues opening bloom.", "\"Renounce (she cries) the rural reed,</br>Tho' sweetly elegant its strains,</br>A nobler theme's for thee decreed</br>Than shady groves, and blooming plains&mdash;</br>To Virtue's soul-inspiring praise,</br>Exalt the animating lays,</br>And with a master's glowing hand,</br>Awake the Lyre's responsive chords magnificently grand.\"</br>"]
