["O lovely May!  when Spring's enchanting smile</br>Hath chas'd stern Winter's rugged frown away,</br>Thou comest on balmy zephyrs to our isle,</br>And all thy peerless charms thou dost display;</br>Soon Nature's in her richest plumage dress'd,</br>The feather'd songsters throng the shady grove,</br>Or on the blossom'd spray beside the nest</br>Responsive warble artless songs of love,</br>And strains harmonious fill the azure arch above.", "Parent of Joy!  thou giv'st to life a zest!</br>At thy approach the vernal blooms expand!</br>The smiling orchard, rob'd in crimson vest,</br>Shews forth the wonders of thy magic hand!</br>And to the breeze which skims the verdant fields,</br>Where gayest flow'rets hill and dale adorn,</br>The hawthorn blossom pleasing fragrance yields</br>Sweet as the mossy rose, or dewy lawn</br>When Night's departing shades retreat before the dawn.", "Gay beauteous nymph!  fair virgin of the year!</br>To view thy countless gems in rich array,</br>And all thy joyful melody to hear,</br>Is bliss on earth no language can pourtray!</br>Far sunk in sensuality's last stage</br>Must that man be that can unmov'd behold</br>The wide creation, God's instructive page,</br>Its lovely treasures to the eye unfold,</br>And can from Nature's God his gratitude withhold.</br>"]
