["O Louse, inhabitant of school-boys coat,</br>Or who on Taylors pericranium crawl'st,</br>Luxurious animal!  whose dayly food</br>The richest emanations are of man,</br>Which from th' imperial seat of Reason flow.", "Beneath the Poet's rectilineal wigg,</br>When to the silent solitary gloom</br>Of his aerial mansion he ascends,</br>Thou rid'st triumphant; his companion sole</br>His labour's consort and invention's aid.</br>For when the peevish Muse her help denies,</br>And dinner hangs dependent on a rhyme;</br>He, by the pleasing titillation mov'd,</br>Scratches the wish'd idea from his brain.</br>Shall he in Dedications daub a lord,</br>Or sing his Mistress in the jocund Ode;</br>And vainly to himself ascribe the Strain?</br>Ungrateful Bard!  to thee of right belong</br>His Lordship's virtues and AURELIA'S charms;</br>To thee, his best of Patrons, Muses, Friends.</br>"]
