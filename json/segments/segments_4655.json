["Oft in the curious lore of antique time,</br>The tasteful reader beauty may espy,</br>Whether, or couched in prose, or stately rhyme,</br>There will the lover oft' be found to sigh,</br>And angel-woman, there, with lustrous eye</br>Radiant to gleam, while sparkling fancy, there,</br>Oft', to the raptur'd sense gives wings to fly</br>Thro' her elysium of conceptions fair,</br>With which gross mortal forms can ne'er compare;</br>The poet's heaven, where wrapp'd in blissful trance,</br>He bids a truce to sorrow and to care,</br>That to his chosen muse he may advance.</br>So Bacon, Barrow, Brown, and Benton shine,</br>So Milton glows intense, and Shakespear beams divine.</br>"]
