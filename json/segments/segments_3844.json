["Haste, O Fair!  and with thee bring</br>Many a little venom'd Sting;</br>Many a Tale that no one knows,</br>Of shall-be-nameless Belles and Beaux,</br>Just-imported Curtain Lectures,</br>Winks, and Nods, and shrewd Conjectures;</br>Half a Dozen strange Suspicions,</br>Built on stranger Suppositions;</br>Unknown Marriages, some twenty,</br>And Horns just fitted to some People's Heads,</br>And certain powder'd Coats, and certain tumbled Beds!</br>"]
