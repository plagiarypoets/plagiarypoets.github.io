["Where is the hand to paint in colours bright</br>The vivid splendour of the western sky,</br>That sparkling flood of evanescent light,</br>Pure and transparent, deepening in its dye.</br>Elysian bowers and isles of rest on high</br>Float o'er the amber tide, and pass away;</br>Each moment changing to the raptured eye.</br>Alas!  no mortal hand can that blest vision stay,</br>Guido's nor Titian's art can fix that fading ray.", "O!  I have gazed, when silent and alone,</br>Till I forgot the globe my feet have prest;</br>Have seen the shores of some bright world unknown,</br>And souls amid the mansions of the blest:</br>Scenes not for man, nor mortal senses drest:</br>Bright rosy meads, and seas of waving light</br>And fairy barks that on those waters rest;</br>They darken, they are gone; as fades the light,</br>And leave me still on earth enveloped all in night.", "So fade the prospects early fancy forms</br>When life is fresh, and all the world is new;</br>Bright are the clouds which soon must meet in storms,</br>Bright all with hope, too happy to be true.</br>Soon sets the beam, and darkness bounds the view,</br>So the etherial soul which did this body move</br>Leaves the dull clod on earth from which it grew;</br>Glances away, where sister souls above</br>Bloom in immortal youth, immortal light and love.</br>"]
