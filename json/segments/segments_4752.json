["How bright was my youth's early morn,</br>Ere reflection had clouded my brow;</br>I selected the rose from the thorn,</br>And was happy, I hardly know how.", "I join'd in the sports of the plain,</br>With rapture I heard the bright song;</br>In the dance, I was first of the train,</br>And was gayest among the gay throng.", "'Tis true, my heart oft breath'd a sigh,</br>But it rose from mild pity alone;</br>If a tear sometimes stray'd from my eye,</br>It flow'd not for griefs of its own.", "No sorrow corroded my heart,</br>No falsehood awakened a fear;</br>For my bosom, a stranger to art,</br>Believ'd every friend was sincere.", "But ah!  these fair visions of youth,</br>Disappointment has chas'd from my mind;</br>And the friends, whom I fancied all truth,</br>Alas!  can be sometimes unkind.", "I have seen the bright azure of morn,</br>With darkness and clouds shadow'd o'er;</br>I have found that the rose has a thorn,</br>Which will wound, when its bloom is no more.", "The sigh, that from sympathy rose,</br>Now heaves not for others alone;</br>And the tear, as it silently flows,</br>Confesses a source of its own.</br>"]
