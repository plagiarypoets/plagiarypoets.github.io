op'ned were,</br>A shrine of pearle and christall did appeare,</br>From whence delicious Oracles were spoken,</br>Which pleasing wonders did to all betoken,</br>Nor is the murmure of Cecropian

grac't,</br>Wherein the loves of Gods and men were plac't:</br>There Neptune in a pretious Margarite</br>Did woe and winne the beautious Amphitrite:</br>There Iphis did in humble sort obey</br>The cruell frownes of Anaxarete:</br>And Princes loves in arts affections clad,</br>Excell'd the passions they by nature had.</br>Thus deckt by art and nature did she come,</br>Whose feature strook the seeming shepheard dumbe,</br>Nor could his wav'ring thoughts themselves containe,</br>But now left off, and straightway pip'd againe:</br>Sometimes his notes he with shrill tunes did raise</br>To chaunt aloud the skipping Roundelaies:</br>And then againe his lowly voyce did fall</br>To sing a pleasant homely Pastorall:</br>And ev'ry song to the Nymphs honour was</br>Like shepheards musicke to a countrey Lasse:</br>Lik'ning her eyes unto the glimsing light,</br>That guides poore heardsmen to their home at night:</br>Her haire unto the golden flowres that grow</br>Along the fragrant banks of silver Po:</br>Her lips to waxe by curious workmanship</br>Form'd as a paterne to each other lip:</br>Thus sung he, till the black and shadie night</br>With ugly forme did feare away the

done,</br>Began to drive their tender flocks away,</br>But Jove did force this sillie maide to stay,</br>Telling her stories how the force of love</br>Had bow'd the hearts of Gods that dwelt above:</br>How Jove orecome by this celestiall power,</br>Deceiv'd poore Danae in a golden shower:</br>How with laments and teares Apollo rued</br>Faire Daphnes change, whom he so fast pursued:</br>Hereat she blusht and to depart she strove;</br>But all in vaine against the force of Jove.</br>This saw the night and glad she was to see</br>So fit revenge for the great injurie,</br>Wherewith Jove wrong'd her at Alcides birth,</br>Making her watch three daies upon the earth:</br>Therefore in hast the darke malicious night</br>To jealous Juno doth relate this sight:</br>Juno enrag'd with threatning speeches storm'd,</br>And the poore maide into an herbe transform'd:</br>Which Jove perceiving by a vaine embrace</br>The infant herbe with heav'nly powers did grace,</br>And on the night he did inflict this paine,</br>That while the pleasant Summer did remaine,</br>The lucklesse night should have but small command,</br>But in the frostie winter longest stand.</br>Yet could not Jove forget his former love,</br>But joyning earthly powers, and powers above,</br>Therewith he did adorne this glorious bud,</br>And fram'd it as a Micro-cosme of good,</br>Making the ground where this sweet plant did spring</br>To be a cordiall gainst each noysome thing,</br>Endu'd with force all evils to asswage,</br>And now began the famous golden age.</br>No publike bond of law, no private oth</br>Was needfull to the simple faith and troth:</br>Each had a censure in his owne consent</br>Without the feare of death or punishment:</br>Nor did the busie Client feare his cause,</br>Nor in strong brasse did they engrave their lawes,</br>Nor did the doubtfull parties faintly tremble,</br>While the brib'd Judge did dreadful looks dissemble:</br>Then safe from harme the vaunting Pine did stand,</br>And had no triall of of the Shipwrights hand,</br>But stood upon the hill where first it grew,</br>Nor yet was forc'd another world to view:</br>Nor unto greedie Merchants yet were knowne</br>The shores of any land beyond their owne:</br>Ev'ry defencelesse Citie then was sure,</br>Nor could deepe ditches make it more secure:</br>The harmelesse thoughts of that blest age did beare</br>No warlike Trumpet, Cornet, Sword, or Speare,</br>No furious Souldier needed to defend</br>The carelesse folke, which quiet lives did spend,</br>Nor did ambitious Captaines know the way</br>To passe the cliffie shores of their owne sea:</br>The earth yet free from any forc'd abuse</br>Brought forth all things fit for each creatures use,</br>Without the helpe of any humane care,</br>Untoucht by harrow, and uncut by share,</br>And mortall men upon those meates did feede,</br>Which of themselves did from the earth proceede,</br>The mountaine Strawberie, and bitter Sloe,</br>And Mulberies which on rough boughs doe grow,</br>And homely Akornes, which did whilom fall</br>From the high trees, which Jove his owne doth call:</br>The pleasant yeare was an eternall spring,</br>Where Westerne winds continual flowres did bring:</br>The fertile earth unmanur'd and untild,</br>The bounteous gift of plenteous corne did yeeld:</br>Nor did the field renew'd each sev'rall yeare</br>Make windy sounds with many a waightie eare:</br>Brookes did with Milke, and pleasant Nectar goe,</br>And yellow hony from the trees did flow:</br>Al good without constraint, heav'n, sea, men, ground,</br>No gold, no ship, no law, no plough, no bound.</br>Till Proserpine by this abused flame,</br>(Striving to purchase an immortall name)</br>Reveng'd with raging fire her ancient spite</br>On Tellus and the scornefull Amphitrite:</br>(Which oft had mockt her mansion place of hell,</br>And call'd it darksome hole, and duskie cell)</br>Therefore the Furies she in hast commands</br>To burne the fruitfull earth with fierie brands,</br>And when their hands such instruments did want,</br>She made them torches of this sacred plant:</br>By which they fir'd the world, and that once done,</br>About the earth in raging sort they runne,</br>And ever since they by these flames did cause</br>Famine, dissention, plagues, and breach of lawes.</br>(Yet was the hellish Queene with feare distract,</br>Least Jove should know and punish this foule fact:</br>Therefore she hir'd the Poets long agone</br>To cast the fault upon poore Phaeton)</br>Now when this honour'd herbe was once abus'd,</br>All paines, all plagues were on the world infus'd,</br>And then the wicked iron age began,</br>Shame, truth, and faith from earthly mansions ran,</br>And in their place came fraud, and cloked vice,</br>Treason, and force, and impious avarice:</br>The Mariner whom hope of lucre blinds,</br>Hasts to the sea unexpert in the winds,</br>And trees that long had stood on mountaines high,</br>As ships upon the uncouth waves doe lie:</br>The Merchant then the boistrous sea did plow,</br>Spite of the frowne of Neptunes angrie brow,</br>Nor could the horrour of one journeyes paine</br>Feare greedie thoughts from ventring so againe:</br>Neptune then grieved with the wounds and dints,</br>Which in his face this curious worke emprints,</br>(And mov'd with Cybels outcries, which did frowne</br>To see her hils defac'd, and Pines puld downe,</br>And Natures plaints, whose lawes it had beguil'd)</br>Made the Sea stormie, which before was mild:</br>Since which the ribs of broken ships doe show,</br>What hurts and dangers by this engine grow,</br>Which makes each fertile countrie want the more,</br>By seeming Steward of each countries store.</br>Now did the warie reaper with long bounds</br>Devide to portions the united grounds,</br>Which erst were common to each mortall wight,</br>As is the liquide ayre, or pleasant light:</br>Nor did they onely take the needfull corne,</br>And daily food, which from the earth was borne,</br>But to the bowels of their mother sought,</br>And cursed riches from the center brought,</br>Which the wise earth had cover'd unespide,</br>And neere unto the Stygian waves did hide.</br>First then began the phrases, Mine, and Thine:</br>Pure water turn'd to artificiall wine:</br>Pleasure unknowne, and more then simple mirth</br>Start up with gold from out the mangled earth:</br>Then bounds, then contracts at a racking price,</br>And from those bounds sprung boundlesse avarice:</br>Then hurtfull steele the workmans hand did feele,</br>And gold more hurtfull then the hurtfull steele:</br>And when both these were comen to perfect growth,</br>Fro thence came warre, that fights with help of both:</br>Then did the souldier, which in battell stands,</br>Shake glittring weapons with his bloodie hands:</br>All liv'd by wrong:  each friend his friend did feare,</br>And brethren seldome linkt in friendship were:</br>The husband seekes the death of his owne wife,</br>And she againe grieves at her husbands life:</br>The angrie stepdames fearfull poysons make,</br>Which their new husbands hated child may take:</br>And the sonne wearie of his fathers stay,</br>Longs for his death before his fatall day.</br>White Pieties dispersed reliques lie</br>Conquer'd, and spoil'd of earthly dignitie,</br>And then Astraea last of heav'nly powers</br>Forsooke the earth reeking with bloodie showers.</br>Yet was not vice ascended to the height:</br>Yet might our pond'rous soules endure the weight</br>Of our corrupted flesh:  yet might we say</br>The growth of sinnes perfection wants a day:</br>Till the fierce Giants of Viperean birth</br>Made loftie heav'n no more secure then earth,</br>Seeking Joves kingdome by presumptuous warres,</br>Building high mountaines to the trembling starres:</br>But Jove the hils did from Olympus tosse,</br>And cast great Pelion from the top of Osse:</br>And when the furious Giants thus were kild,</br>By the great weight which their own hads did build,</br>The earth gave life unto her childrens blood,</br>And fram'd them living bodies of her mud,</br>And (least no signe should of her stocke remaine)</br>She chang'd them to the formes of men againe,</br>Who not degen'rate from their bloodie birth,</br>Defi'd the heaven, and defil'd the earth.</br>Then first ambitious mortals gan to rise,</br>And with vaine pride did the great Gods despise,</br>Still warr'd they with the Gods, still had the worst,</br>And when their hands could do no more, they curst:</br>Nor could the flood that inward spot deface,</br>Still it continued in the humane race,</br>Creeping unseene, subjecting ev'ry part,</br>Till it possest our chiefest towre, our hart:</br>Which thus infected did a battell wage</br>Gainst the remainders of the golden age.</br>Then cursed Ate first began her raigne,</br>And plac't her throne upon the fluent maine,</br>Joying to see the billowes in their pride</br>Tosse totter'd ships with perill on each side:</br>Yet sorie Neptune should so largely sup,</br>And glad againe, when ought he vomits up.</br>By her hath ev'ry thing corrupted beene</br>From the earths center to the heav'nly Queene:</br>(Which stands above the reach of earthly feares,</br>The lowest of the pure celestiall sphaeres)</br>The fertile earth corrupted by these seedes</br>Brought forth unholesome plants, and fruitlesse weeds:</br>The water not content with her owne bounds,</br>Usurpt upon the neere adjacent grounds:</br>The ayre infected did infect the breath,</br>From whence arose the instruments of death:</br>The fire so hid her selfe, that none could see</br>Where her abode or proper place should bee:</br>Then sicknesse came on the infected earth,</br>Some fell in youth, some perisht in their birth,</br>And whereas mortals never died before,</br>Till spent with age their lights could burne no more,</br>Now fathers eyes were made a watrie sourse,</br>To wash their sonnes graves in prepost'rous course.</br>And had not the immortall Gods at last,</br>Pitying the sorrowes sillie men had past,</br>Cherisht poore soules with their eternall love,</br>And sent Apollo Paean from above,</br>To crosse the purpose which the hag intended,</br>Long since her malice all the world had ended:</br>Yet could not carefull Phoebus quite deface</br>The venome Ate on the earth did place,</br>Till Aesculapius great Apolloes sonne</br>(Envying the glorie shepheard Pan had wonne,</br>When of his love transform'd he did invent</br>The pleasure of a Musicke instrument)</br>Descri'd this herbe to our new golden age,</br>And did devise a pipe, which should asswage</br>The wounds, which sorrow in our hearts did fixe,</br>More then the sound of flutes, and fiddle-sticks,</br>And by the force thereof (as Poets faine)</br>Brought torne Hippolytus to life againe,</br>And watchmen set, and them Phisitians call'd</br>Men, whom the Muses had before enstall'd,</br>Whose carefull soules were by this potion fir'd,</br>And by the power of this sweete herbe inspir'd,</br>Which by the vertue of their sacred hands</br>Deliver'd men from death, and sicknes bands.", "Others affirme the Gods were ignorant</br>Of the confection of so sweet a plant:</br>For had they knowne this smokes delicious smack,</br>The vault of heav'n ere this time had been black,</br>And by the operation of this fume</br>Been purg'd for ever of her clowdie rheume:</br>Daintie Ambrosia with a loth'd disdaine</br>Had been made meate for each milk-pottage-braine:</br>Joves Ganymede had never smelt of drinke,</br>The heav'nly Mazers flowing ore the brinke,</br>Nor fixen Juno ever broke his head</br>For spilling Nectar on the gorgeous bed:</br>Gods would have reveld at their feasts of mirth</br>With the pure distillation of the earth,</br>The marrow of the world, starre of the West,</br>The pearle, whereby this lower Orbe is blest,</br>The joy of mortals, umpire of all strife,</br>Delight of nature, Mithridate of life,</br>The daintiest dish of a delicious feast,</br>By taking which man differs from a beast.</br>Thrice happie Isles, which steale the worlds delight,</br>And doe produce so rich a Margarite:</br>Had but the old Heroick spirits knowne</br>The newes, which fame unto our eares hath blowne,</br>Colchis, and the remote Hesperides</br>Had not been sought for halfe so much as these:</br>Nor had the fluent wits of ancient Greece</br>Prais'd the rich apples, or the golden fleece:</br>Nor had Apolloes garland been of bayes,</br>Nor Homer writ of sweete Nepenthes praise:</br>Nor had Anacreon with a sugred glose</br>Extold the vertues of the fragrant Rose:</br>Nor needed Hermes with his fluent tongue</br>Have join'd in one a rude uncivill throng,</br>And by perswasions made that companie</br>An order'd Politike societie,</br>When this dumbe Oratour would more perswade,</br>Then all the speeches Mercurie had made:</br>Nor honour'd Ceres been create divine,</br>And worshipt so at curious Eleusine,</br>Whom blinder ages did so much adorne</br>For the invention of the use of corne:</br>Nor Saturnes feast had been the joyfull day,</br>Wherein the Romanes washt their cares away,</br>But in the honour of great Trinidade</br>A new Tabacconalia had been made:</br>Had watrie Neptune knowne the force of this</br>He had prevail'd, and Athens had been his,</br>His gift the Olive would as farre exceed,</br>As Pallas gift excell'd his trampling steed:</br>Immortall Chiron had he knowne this leafe,</br>(Hurt by an arrow of Alcides sheafe)</br>Had never wisht the troden mortall way,</br>But might have well been cur'd, and liv'd for aye:</br>Had foule Thersites with his spitefull hart,</br>Crook'd in each inward, and each outward part,</br>By this Elixir been but once refin'd,</br>He would have chang'd his bodie, and his mind:</br>Or had the Bees that Platoes lips did grace,</br>Suckt hony from this sweete Tabacco-place,</br>He had surpast, and stain'd himselfe as farre,</br>As others by his stile obscured are:</br>With this had Circe in her pleasant cave</br>Temper'd the potion she Ulysses gave,</br>He never would have wisht, that his blest eyes</br>Might once behold his countries smoke arise:</br>Had ancient Heralds knowne this sacred plant,</br>Of which their lucklesse age was ignorant,</br>When they did give the worlds most worthie things,</br>As glorious ensignes to victorious Kings,</br>Tabacco had been richer armorie,</br>Then Lions, Crosses, or spread Eaglets be:</br>Did the French Druids live, and were obey'd,</br>Nicot (that first this herbe to France convey'd)</br>Should be the God of pleasures and delights,</br>Worshipt with pompe on Bacchanalian nights,</br>And in his praise the barb'rous Priests would sing</br>Untuned numbers in a jarring string,</br>Carving harsh rimes on ev'ry knottie tree,</br>More crookt and rugged, then the booke could bee,</br>Sounding in ev'ry homely verse they frame</br>The treble accent of God Nicots name:</br>Had the sage Chaldees which did name the stars,</br>And were the first, and best Astronomers,</br>Seene the great wonders, which our eyes have seene,</br>This plant had then a constellation beene.</br>Nor had the honour'd Ramme begun the yeare;</br>Nor the high Northerne pole adorn'd the Beare;</br>Nor Jove disgrac'd, nor with his Minions fild</br>Th' engraven vault, which first his hands did build:</br>Our herbe had been a Planet, and indu'd</br>With light above the greatest magnitude,</br>And when this starre had stood in good aspect</br>With happie Planets of the best effect,</br>He, whom the proud world them to light should bring,</br>Had been a Poet, or at least a King:</br>Saturne had never brag'd his chariot went</br>The next unto the azure firmament:</br>Nor had the Sunne in his Majestick pride</br>Been thron'd with equall Planets on each side:</br>Nor for high births had the Astrologer</br>Markt the conjunction of great Jupiter.</br>Were my quaint polisht tongue my soules best hopes,</br>And grac't with figures, colours, schemes, and tropes,</br>This herbe would surpasse in excellence</br>The great'st Hyperboles of eloquence:</br>Yet this sweete simple by misordred use</br>Death or some dang'rous sicknesse may induce,</br>Should we not for our sustentation eate,</br>Because a surfet comes from too much meate?</br>Should we not thirst with mod'rate drinke represse,</br>Because a dropsie springs from such excesse?</br>Should we not take some holesome exercise</br>To chafe our vaines, and stretch our arteries,</br>Because abus'd in a laborious kind</br>It hurts the bodie, and amates the mind?</br>So our faire plant, that doth as needfull stand,</br>As heav'n, or fire, or aire, or sea, or land,</br>As Moone, or Starres, that rule the gloomie night,</br>Or Tullies friendship, or the Sunnie light,</br>Her sacred vertue in her selfe enroules,</br>And leaves the evill in vaine-glorious soules,</br>And yet who dyes cloid with celestiall breath,</br>Shall dye with joy a Diagorian death.</br>All goods, all pleasures it in one doth linke,</br>Tis Phisick, clothing, Musick, meate and drinke:</br>It makes the hungrie soules forget their wants,</br>And nimbly daunce like skipping Corybants:</br>By force of this Timon that odious beast</br>Would have turn'd jester at each solemne feast,</br>And by one draught of this Americk grape</br>Have been Laberius or Sarmentus ape:</br>Nor would the Cynick in his homely tunne</br>Have askt the shining of the gen'rall Sunne,</br>But had he then this herbes great vertues knowne,</br>He would have beg'd it of the Macedone.</br>The Faunes and Satyres which doe lightly praunce,</br>The beasts that after Orpheus musick daunce,</br>At sight of this would have forgot the sound,</br>The Ecchoes would no more the voice rebound,</br>Orpheus himselfe would have forsooke his Lute,</br>And altogether stood amaz'd, and mute.</br>The lumpish Stoicks, which did thus decree,</br>A mortall man might without passion bee,</br>Had they once cast their carelesse eyes on this,</br>Would soone have showne what humane nature is:</br>The Epicureans, whose chiefe good was plac't</br>In earthly pleasures vaine voluptuous tast,</br>Had our Tabacco in their daies been found,</br>Had built their frame on a more likely ground.</br>Pyrrho that held all by opinion stood,</br>Would have affirm'd this were by nature good:</br>The rude Laconians, whom Lycurgus care</br>Barr'd from the traffick of exotick ware,</br>Had Malea been with such a treasure fraught,</br>Would have esteem'd their strictest acts at nought,</br>And with a slight pretence, or fained cause,</br>Have crackt the credit of their cobweb lawes.</br>When eloquent Hegesias caus'd men die</br>With disputation of lives miserie,</br>Had this life-giving pleasant potion then</br>Been once imparted to those desp'rate men,</br>It would have sooner forced them to live,</br>Then the commaunds great Ptolomie could give:</br>Had Phoebus Hyacinth, or faire Narcissus,</br>Venus Adonis, or sweete Cyparissus,</br>By the propitious Gods been turn'd to this,</br>Happie had been their Metamorphosis:</br>Yet it may be to this they were not turn'd,</br>Because their lovers griev'd to see them burn'd:</br>This is the Opium, which the Turks doe take,</br>When they their hearts would light and jocund make:</br>By this Medea did her drinke compose,</br>Which Aeson did from aged bonds unlose:</br>You finde not a diviner herbe then this,</br>In all Albertus de miraculis:</br>Or the huge Herbals, which vaine fooles obey,</br>In Porta, Fuchsius, and great Dodoney:</br>In it Phisitians have no skill at all,</br>It is an essence Metaphysicall,</br>Nor is a thing so exquisite, so pure,</br>Compos'd of any common temp'rature:</br>Nor can the Scepticks, or Empiricks see</br>This herbs great vertue, nature and degree:</br>Who takes this med'cine need not greatly care,</br>Who Galenists, who Paracelsians are:</br>Nor need he seeke their Rosaries, their Summes,</br>Their Secrets, their Dispensatoriums:</br>Nor fill his pocket with their costly bils,</br>Nor stuffe his maw with their unsav'ry pils,</br>Nor make huge pitfals in his tender vaines,</br>With thousand other more then hellish paines,</br>But by this herbes celestiall qualitie</br>May keepe his health in mirth and jollitie:</br>It is the fountaine whence all pleasure springs,</br>A potion for imperiall crowned Kings:</br>He that is master of so rich a store,</br>May laugh at Croesus, and esteeme him poore,</br>And with his smokie scepter in his fist</br>Securely flout the toyling Alchymist,</br>Who daily labours with a vaine expence</br>In distillations of the quint-essence,</br>Not knowing, that this golden herbe alone</br>Is the Philosophers admired stone:</br>It is your gallants med'cine singular,</br>As Possets to the wearied Ploughman are:</br>Alcinous trees, nor the Isles fortunate</br>Cannot afford so sweet a delicate:</br>Teucer had never purg'd his cares with wine,</br>Had he but dream't of Phisick so divine:</br>Nor Bacchus had been Patrone of delight,</br>Nor govern'd Tigers with his princely might,</br>Nor conquer'd all the nations of the earth,</br>Because he tam'd their savage minds with mirth:</br>Nor had Mercuriall, or herbe Gentiane</br>The glorious names of Gods, or Princes tane:</br>Moly of which the Prince of Poets wrote,</br>Spaines Triacle, or the strongest Antidote,</br>Is not so good against a Magicke spell,</br>Nor deadly poyson from th' heart t' expell,</br>As our most glorious plant:  which had it beene</br>In ancient times, and famous ages seene,</br>The fruitfull Olive, and sweet-smelling Bayes</br>Had never been the signes of peace, and praise:</br>Long since the blessed Thistle, and Herbe-grace</br>Had lost their names, and been accounted base,</br>Had great Tabacco pleas'd to shew her powers,</br>As now she doth in this blest age of ours,</br>Blest age, wherein the Indian Sunne had shin'd,</br>Whereby all Arts, all tongues have been refin'd:</br>Learning long buried in the darke abysme</br>Of dunsticall, and monkish barbarisme,</br>When once this herbe by carefull paines was found,</br>Sprung up like Cadmus followers from the ground,</br>Which Muses visitation bindeth us,</br>More to great Cortez, and Vespucius,</br>Then to our wittie Mores immortall name,</br>To Valla, or the learned Rott'rodame:</br>And our poore tongue, which long had barren laine,</br>Wanting the fall of sweete Parnassian raine,</br>Was lightned by this Planets radiant beames,</br>Which rising from the Westerne ocean streames,</br>Melteth the drie clowdes to celestiall showres,</br>And on our heads those heav'nly fountaines powres:</br>Had the Castalian Muses knowne the place,</br>Which this Ambrosia did with honour grace,</br>They would have left Parnassus long agoe,</br>And chang'd their Phocis for Wingandekoe;</br>Yet it may be the people voide of sense,</br>With savage rites, and manners fear'd them thence:</br>But our more glorious Nymph, our moderne Muse,</br>Which life and light doth to the North infuse,</br>Which doth with joint and mutuall honour grace</br>Her place with learning, learning with her place:</br>In whose respect the Muses barb'rous are,</br>The Graces rude, nor is the Phoenix rare:</br>Which farre exceedes her predecessours facts,</br>Nor are their wondrous acts, now wondrous acts:</br>Which by her wisdome, and her Princely powers</br>Defends the walles of Albions cliffie towers,</br>Hath uncontrol'd stretcht out her mightie hand</br>Over Virginia, and the New-found-land,</br>And spread the Colours of our English Rose</br>In the farre countries, where Tabacco growes,</br>And tam'd the savage nations of the West,</br>Which of this jewell were in vaine possest:</br>Nor is it marvaile that this pretious gem</br>Is thus beset with beasts, and kept by them,</br>When it is likely, that almightie Jove,</br>By such fierce keepers to obscure it strove,</br>Bearing against it an immortall hate,</br>As the gainsayer of eternall fate:</br>Besides a thousand dangers circle round,</br>What ever good within this world is found,</br>Least mortals should no worke, nor trade professe,</br>But spend their daies in lust, and idlenesse:</br>And least their fickle thoughts should soone disdaine</br>The things they got but with a little paine:</br>Therefore best fruites are cover'd with hard shels,</br>The sweetest water is in deepest wels,</br>And Indian Ants as big as Mastives hold</br>A place most fertile of desired gold,</br>Sicile the garner of the earth, her pride</br>Hath Scylla and Charybdis on each side,</br>And in times past had a plague worse then these,</br>Of the fierce Cyclops and Laestrygones,</br>The horride Dragon, which did never sleepe,</br>The Orchard of the golden fruite did keepe,</br>And in the countries, which be hot and drie,</br>The dreadfull beasts about the fountaines lie,</br>And Gotthish Spaniards have the royaltie,</br>Where glorious gold, and rich Tabacco be,</br>A nation worse then the Laestrygones,</br>And farre more savage then the Savages:</br>Yet doth not this divine Tabacco soile,</br>Which shines like a bright Diamond in a foile,</br>And doth as farre excell the golden graines,</br>As gold the brasse, or silver pewter staines,</br>Although the Chymists say, our mother beares</br>Gold in her wombe so many thousand yeares,</br>Ere she can perfect what she hath begunne,</br>And bring to full growth that terrestriall Sunne:</br>And though the Theban Lyrick crown'd with bayes</br>Begins his Odes with that sweet mettals praise,</br>Yet countervailes it not this herbs desart,</br>But only shares a yonger brothers part:</br>For this our praised plant on high doth sore</br>Above the baser drosse of earthly ore,</br>Like the brave spirit, and ambitious mind,</br>Whose Eaglets eyes the Sunne-beames cannot blind,</br>Nor can the clog of povertie depresse</br>Such soules in base, and native lowlinesse,</br>But proudly scorning to behold the earth,</br>They leape at Crownes, and reach above their birth:</br>Despised mud sinkes to the center straight,</br>But worthie things will strive to get on height:</br>So our sweete herbe all earthly drosse doth hate,</br>Though in the earth both nourisht, and create,</br>And as the nature is of smoke, and fire</br>Leaves this low orbe, and labours to aspire</br>Wrapt in the cincture of her smokie shroudes,</br>Mixing her vapours with the ayrie cloudes,</br>And from these fumes ascending to the skies,</br>Some say the dewes, and gentle showres arise,</br>And from the fire thereof the Cyclops strove</br>To frame the mightie thunderbolts of Jove:</br>This is a savour which the Gods doth please,</br>If they doe feed on smoke (as Lucian sayes)</br>Therefore the cause that the bright Sunne doth rest</br>At the low point of the declining West,</br>When his oft-wearied horses breathlesse pant,</br>Is to refresh himselfe with this sweet plant,</br>Which wanton Thetis from the West doth bring,</br>To joy her love after his toilesome ring:</br>For 'tis a cordiall for an inward smart,</br>As is Dictamnum to the wounded Hart:</br>It is the sponge that wipes out all our woe;</br>'Tis like the thorne that doth on Pelion grow,</br>With which who-ere his frostie limbes anoints,</br>Shall feele no cold in his benummed joints;</br>'Tis like the river, which who ere doth tast,</br>Forgets his present griefes and sorrowes past:</br>Musick, which causeth vexed thoughts retire,</br>And for a while cease their tormenting fire:</br>Musick the prize, which when the eares have stole,</br>They doe convey it to th' attentive soule:</br>Musick, which forceth beasts to stand at gaze,</br>And doth the rude and senselesse soules amaze:</br>Compar'd to this, is like delicious strings,</br>Which sound but harshly while Apollo sings:</br>The braine with this infum'd all quarrell ends,</br>Tullie and Clodius will be faithfull friends,</br>And like another Crassus one carouse</br>Will linke againe Pompey, and Caesars house,</br>And quickly stint the inhumane designes</br>Of furious Guelphes, and warlike Gibellines.</br>The man that shall this smokie Magick prove,</br>Shall need no Philters to obtaine his love,</br>But shall be deckt with farre more pleasing grace,</br>Then ere was Nireus or Narcissus face.</br>Here could I tell you, how upon the seas</br>Some men have fasted with it fortie daies:</br>How those, to whom Plinie no mouths did give,</br>Doe only on divine Tabacco live:</br>How Andron, which did passe the Lybian sands</br>Unto the place where Hammons Temple stands,</br>And never dranke, nor was he ever dry,</br>Supprest the heate of raging thirst thereby:</br>How a dull Cynick by the force of it</br>Hath got a pleasing gesture, and good wit:</br>How sparing Demea whom the Comick chaung'd,</br>By this was from his former selfe estraung'd:</br>How many Cowards base and recreant,</br>By one pipes draught were turned valiant,</br>And after in an artificiall mist</br>Have overthrowne their foes before they wist:</br>How one that dreamt of a Tabacco roll,</br>Though sick before, was straight made perfect whole.</br>Peace pratling Muse, offend sage eares no more,</br>Die in the seas which canst not get the shore,</br>And sinke, as overwhelm'd with too much matter,</br>Least telling all the world should thinke thee flatter:</br>Doe not, like curious Plinie, seeke to know,</br>Whence the earths smoke, and secret flames do grow,</br>Least this immortall fire, and sacred fume,</br>Like to Vesuvius doe thy powers consume:</br>But clok'd with vapours of a duskie hue,</br>Bid both the world and thy sweet herbe Adue.</br>"]
