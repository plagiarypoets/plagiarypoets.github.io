["Virgin, brighter than the morning,</br>Haste and finish thy adorning!</br>Hymen claims his promised day,&mdash;</br>Come from thy chamber, come away!", "Roses strew, and myrtles bring,</br>Till you drain the wasted Spring;&mdash;</br>The altars are already drest,</br>The bower is fitted for its guest,</br>The scattered rose begins to fade,&mdash;</br>Come away, reluctant maid!", "See what a war of blushes breaks</br>O'er the pure whiteness of her cheeks;</br>The shifting colours prove by turns</br>The torch of Love unsteady burns.</br>Pleading now, now lingering, fainting,</br>Her soft heart with fear is panting;&mdash;</br>Cling not to thy mother so,</br>Thy mother smiles, and bids thee go.", "Mind not what thy maidens say;</br>Though they chide the cruel day,</br>Though they weep, and strive to hold thee</br>From his arms that would enfold thee;</br>Kiss, and take a short farewell,&mdash;</br>They wish the chance to them befell.", "Mighty Love demands his crown</br>Now for all his sufferings done;</br>For all Love's tears, for all his sighs,</br>Thyself must be the sacrifice.</br>Virgin, brighter than the day,</br>Haste from thy chamber, come away!</br>"]
