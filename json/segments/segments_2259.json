["In the grove now I carelessly stray,</br>Or pensive recline by the stream;</br>And my lambkins they wander away,</br>Nor am I, O ye shepherds!  to blame.", "For when PHILLIDA grac'd the gay mead,</br>How sweet was the fields and the flow'rs!</br>And the hillocks, with daisies o'erspread,</br>And lightly then frolick'd the hours.", "How sweet in the shady alcoves,</br>Or with her in the valley to stray!</br>While the nightingales warbled their loves,</br>And my lambkins around us did play.", "Swift flew these fleet moments away;</br>It mayhap that they ne'er will return:</br>O!  wherefore!  can PHILLIDA say,</br>Has she left her fond shepherd to mourn?", "Now the valley no longer can please,</br>And the grove where she often did stray,</br>Serves only to banish my ease,</br>Since now the dear charmer's away.", "For my flocks they at freedom may stray,</br>And leave poor ALEXIS to mourn;</br>And my pipe I'll fling useless away,</br>Unless the dear nymph will return.", "As I pensive recline by the rill,</br>And silently sigh to the stream,</br>Or slumber beneath the green hill;</br>I ne'er but of PHILLIDA dream.</br>"]
