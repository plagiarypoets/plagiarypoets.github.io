["Then trembling lyre, from thee fair freedom's strain,</br>Will burst like torrent from its native bed,</br>Impetuous, strong, when contest ploughs the plain,</br>Glidingly sweet, where softer scenes are spread;&mdash;</br>Then, bright reveal'd, will stand each mountain's head,</br>Each valley's bosom and each forest deep,</br>Rob'd in their stole of snow, while o'er them shed</br>Smile the moon's midnight beams, as in the steep</br>Of the clear sparkling heaven she doth her station keep:&mdash;", "Shine in thy lay the northern summer's beam,</br>Bloom the bright flowers it wakes to instant birth,</br>Dash the unfetter'd torrent, the calm stream,</br>Flow bright between its banks of green-clad earth;</br>With sudden verdure stand the forest forth,</br>The pine-crown'd hill arise, down whos dark sides</br>Roll the white flakes before spring's sunny mirth,</br>That like compassion's once unfrozen tides,</br>Turn to a fruitful flood, that glads where'er it glides.", "Yes &mdash; as the varied scenes by nature given,</br>Or fancy, nature-taught creates around,</br>Call out thy strains to paint in earth or heaven,</br>All that she gives below, or in the bound</br>Of yon bright arch appears &mdash; thou wilt be found,</br>Still faithful to her hues, her feelings still&mdash;</br>Whether the battle gleam, the battle sound,</br>The maiden's eye with secret tear-drop fill,</br>Or the rous'd patriot's voice each burning bosom thrill.</br>"]
