["The sun is warm, the sky is clear,</br>The waves are dancing fast and bright,</br>Blue isles and snowy mountains wear</br>The purple noon's transparent light</br>Around its unexpanded buds;</br>Like many a voice of one delight,</br>The winds, the birds, the ocean floods,</br>The City's voice itself is soft, like Solitude's.", "I see the Deep's untrampled floor,</br>With green and purple seaweed strown;</br>I see the waves upon the shore,</br>Like light dissolved in star-showers, thrown:</br>I sit upon the sands alone,</br>The lightning of the noon-tide ocean</br>Is flashing round me, and a tone</br>Arises from its measured motion,</br>How sweet!  did any heart now share in my emotion.", "Alas!  I have nor hope nor health,</br>Nor peace within nor calm around,</br>Nor that content surpassing wealth</br>The sage in meditation found,</br>And walked with inward glory crown'd&mdash;</br>Nor fame, nor power, nor love, nor leisure,</br>Others I see whom these surround&mdash;</br>Smiling they live and call life pleasure;&mdash;</br>To me that cup has been dealt in another measure.", "Yet now despair itself is mild,</br>Even as the winds and waters are;</br>I could lie down like a tired child,</br>And weep away the life of care</br>Which I have borne and yet must bear,</br>Till death like sleep might steal on me,</br>And I might feel in the warm air</br>My cheek grow cold, and hear the sea</br>Breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony.", "Some might lament that I were cold,</br>As I, when this sweet day is gone,</br>Which my lost heart, too soon grown old,</br>Insults with this untimely moan;</br>They might lament &mdash; for I am one</br>Whom men love not &mdash; and yet regret,</br>Unlike this day, which, when the sun</br>Shall on its stainless glory set,</br>Will linger, though enjoyed, like joy in memory yet.</br>"]
