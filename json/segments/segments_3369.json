["Roving where love and contemplation stray,</br>Ideal vision drew the sacred Nine;</br>As on their all mellifluous lyres they play,</br>And O!  methought they breath'd a lay like thine,</br>Such was its melting sound, \"and energy divine!\"", "Methought they sung the song of soft complaint,</br>Alas!  they cried, Insipience strikes the string;</br>Each Briton's voice, alas!  how poor, how faint,</br>In what an apathetic strain they sing,</br>The renovated health of Albion's glorious King!", "With boundless rapture bid the power inspire,</br>The blooming Falconer's pathetick mind:</br>Let every Muse transfuse the Heav'nly fire,</br>And round her brow the living laurel bind,</br>T' astonish and to awe too arrogant mankind.", "Calliope the blooming wreath shall bear;</br>And bathe her temples from the Muse's spring;</br>Shield her soft breast from ev'ry female fear,</br>And bid her mount on Fancy's vent'rous wing,</br>The vast empyreal heights where few have dar'd to sing!", "The substance this; for I but faintly caught</br>The sounds the Falconer soars aloof to hear:</br>My nerveless note Heavenly Muse has taught,</br>To shrill the soul, or chain the raptur'd ear,</br>While Nature drops the fond, the proud extatick tear!</br>"]
