["I have not wandered with unheeding eye,</br>Midst nature's marvels; I have sought to blend</br>My mind with what I gazed on, and to pry</br>Into the hidden worth of charms, that lend</br>A loveliness to earth; my soul would rend</br>The cloud that veils our vision, and behold</br>The inward gaze and glory that transcend</br>Our farthest thought of beauty; see unroll'd</br>Creation's page, and mark &mdash; what truths are brightly told.", "And never did there meet my gladdened glance,</br>A wonder more awakening than the sight</br>Of that cloud-mingling mountain, on which dance</br>The dying splendours of the sun-set light</br>That gilds the glowing west; the icy height</br>Seems crown'd with roses, momently they fade,</br>As deeper sinks the day-star, but his flight</br>Flings hues more tender still, than first arrayed</br>The ensky'd snows that here a heavenly hand hath laid.", "And now those tints are vanished, with the rays</br>That gave them borrowed being, and now crowd</br>Before us the pale vapours; day decays</br>More palpably.  A cold uncoloured cloud</br>Spreads sadly o'er the giant-crag a shroud</br>Dimensionless; the evening shadows fall</br>And find us still to contemplation vowed;</br>For death had darkened over us, and the pall</br>Of our own pensive thoughts at length envelops all!</br>"]
