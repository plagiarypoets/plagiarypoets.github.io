["See, through the mazes of the midnight ball</br>With rapid feet yon splendid triflers fly;</br>From every tongue what flattering periods fall,</br>How smiles each face!  how sparkles every eye!</br>So loud their mirth, thou deem'st no sorrow nigh.</br>But learn thou, erring judge!  there Envy lours,</br>There Jealousy extorts the bitterest sigh,</br>There, all her poison'd chalice Scandal pours,</br>And Lassitude soon clogs the bliss-devoted hours.", "But O how sweet, how passing sweet to rove</br>Where sits unseen the Minstrel of the Night,</br>And trills such music o'er the listening grove</br>As sure might harmonize the rudest sprite!</br>Then while the Moon from her meridian height,</br>And all the countless stars that round her burn,</br>Shed o'er the tranquil scene their tender light;</br>The soul, sublimed, each earthly care may spurn,</br>And toward its native heaven with holy longing turn!", "Then, nought of discord harsh thine ear shall wound,</br>Like theirs who tread the city's crowded ways!</br>The distant water's faintly-murmuring sound;</br>The whispering wind, that through the foliage strays;</br>The tinkling bell of sheep, that startled gaze;</br>The clock's deep chime, from half-hid village spire;</br>The watchful dog, at fancied thief who bays;</br>Though simple all their tones, such thoughts inspire,</br>That from thy bosom far shall Passion's brood retire.", "Even Beauty triumphs in diviner charms,</br>And bids the heart with tenderer feelings glow,</br>When seen where nought, or sickens, or alarms;</br>Than mid the haunts of riot, glare, and show.</br>Where laugh the skies above, and plains below,</br>Her airy form more winning grace assumes,</br>With more luxuriant ease her tresses flow,</br>Her speaking eye more dazzling light illumes,</br>And o'er her dimpled cheek suffuse health's softest blooms!</br>"]
