["'Twas as bright PHOEBUS, from the ocean rose,</br>And sighing Zephyrs sprang to kiss the boughs;</br>That ROGER, artless, as his numbers are,</br>Reclining, thus address'd his faithless fair,&mdash;</br>\"O SUSAN!  canst thou so ungrateful prove?</br>And set at nought thy ROGER'S plighted love!</br>Canst thou forget what goodly fairings I,</br>Would bring thee home?  What pleasing ballads buy&mdash;</br>With minims set, and pins to deck thy hair?</br>Nor ever thought a village-lass so fair&mdash;</br>How canst thou, SUSAN, from thy vows depart?</br>Vows, whilst upon thy sheath I carv'd my heart;</br>The glass and spoon, you said, should disagree,</br>The much lov'd kettle lose it's use at tea;</br>Christmas should turn to Whitsuntide, and reel</br>The year about, &mdash; as doth thy fav'rite wheel,</br>E're thou would faithless prove, or change to be,</br>The pride, the joy, of any Swain but me.", "\"Now, ah!  ambitious of some wealthier spouse,</br>Thou disregard'st me, disregard'st thy vows.\"</br>"]
