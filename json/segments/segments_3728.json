["Close enwrapt in musing trance,</br>See yon pensive youth advance,</br>Drest in flowing sable robe,</br>Grasping in his hand a globe:</br>Mark his step, and mark his gait,</br>See he scorns the pomp of state;</br>Looks with pity on a throne,</br>Love to live and die alone,</br>For Melancholy mark'd him for her own.", "Hence, begone!  th' Enthusiast cries,</br>(Darting wild his flaming eyes)</br>Folly fond, and fashion gay,</br>Silken pleasure, hence away.</br>By the world forsook, forgot,</br>Let me seek thy shady grot,</br>Melancholy, heav'nly maid,</br>Thick embower'd in cypress glade,</br>And weave a chaplet Fortune cannot fade.", "While the shades that glimm'ring fall,</br>Gently steal along the wall,</br>Mantling some monastic pile,</br>Or cathedral's holy aisle,</br>Let me haunt the sacred gloom,</br>Watch, and whisper round the tomb:</br>Meditation mild, and fair,</br>Soars sublime, through fields of air,</br>To worlds of glory which the blessed share,", "Or when sober twilight gray</br>Closes up the eye of day,</br>Let me tread where giant oak</br>Never felt the Woodman's stroke;</br>Seek some Hermit's lone retreat,</br>Or some mossy grass-grown seat:</br>There entranc'd I love to lie,</br>And with keen and piercing eye</br>Explore the gems that glitter'd in the sky.", "Aweful grandeur!  splendid sight!</br>Glorious frame refulgent bright!</br>Lo!  the Moon, serenely sweet,</br>Tips with gold the Eagle's seat;</br>Gilds the cliff's rough rugged side,</br>Trembles o'er the wat'ry tide:</br>Not a breeze presumes to blow,</br>Solemn silence rules below;</br>Charm'd with the sight, my bosom learns to glow.", "Let me tread the pebbly shore,</br>When the wild waves rave and roar;</br>When the mighty whirlwinds sweep</br>O'er the bosom of the deep;</br>When the surges mountain high</br>Seem to dash against the sky;</br>String my arm with strength to save,</br>Beating back the boist'rous wave,</br>Yon ship wreck'd Sailor from a wat'ry grave.", "Oft I range the desart plain,</br>Oft attend the house of pain,</br>Bending o'er the bed of death,</br>Cheer the sufferer's parting breath;</br>Or unbolt the Felon's cell,</br>Where despair and anguish dwell;</br>Call repentance from on high,</br>On his sullen couch to lie,</br>And calm his woe to-morrow doom'd to die.", "How I glory to impart</br>Comfort to a sinking heart,</br>Smooth affliction's thorny bed,</br>Sooth the mourner, raise his head!</br>While my time I thus employ,</br>Catch a melancholy joy;</br>Far from cities far I flee,</br>Scenes like these I seek to see&mdash;</br>O Melancholy, let me dwell with thee!</br>"]
