["\"Accept, dear Phil, this rude, unskilful verse,</br>Tho' nor by Muse inspir'd, nor Grace refin'd,</br>Which I, in loose alternate rhime rehearse,</br>To soothe the sorrows of thy gentle mind.", "\"What, tho' no polish'd lines, like Pope's, appear,</br>No boldly-splendid thoughts my theme refine,</br>&mdash;Such as in Spenser's nobler page appear,</br>Or Collins, in thy strains majestic shine?", "\"I court not now the laurel'd wreath of Fame,</br>Or various praise of nervous, smooth, and clear.</br>Enough my honour, all I wish and claim,</br>If with my verse thy bosom I may cheer.", "\"Fair Friendship's voice shall breathe in ev'ry line</br>The faithful dictates of an honest heart:</br>Friendship alone inspir'd the fair design</br>To thee, these soothing verses to impart.", "\"No need is there of lofty Spenser's fire;</br>No need of tuneful Pope's energic art,</br>To strike, with trembling hand, a humble lyre,</br>And sing the genuine feelings of the heart.", "\"But if my numbers should offend thy ear,</br>Oh think they flow from an uneasy heart:</br>The voice of Anguish never can be clear,</br>And Melancholy mars the tuneful art.</br>"]
