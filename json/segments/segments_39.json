["Come Death the anchor-hold of all my thoughts,</br>My last resort whereto my soule appeales,</br>For all too-long on earth my fancy dotes,</br>Whilst age upon my wasted body steales.</br>That hart being made the prospective of horror,</br>That honored hath the cruelest faire that lives,</br>The cruelest faire, that sees I languish for her,</br>Yet never mercy to my merrite gives.</br>Thys is her Lawrell and her triumphes prize,</br>To tread me downe with foote of her disgrace:</br>Whilst I did build my fortune in her eyes,</br>And layd my lives rest on so faire a face;</br>Which rest I lost, my love, my life, and all,</br>So high attempts to low disgraces fall.", "[sig. C3]", "Come Time the anchor-hold of my desire,</br>My last Resort whereto my hopes appeale,</br>Cause once the date of her disdane t' expire:</br>Make her the sentence of her wrath repeale.</br>Rob her fair Brow, breake in on Beauty, steale</br>Powre from those eyes, which pitty cannot spare:</br>Deale with those dainty cheekes as she doth deale</br>With this poore heart consumed with dispare.</br>This heart made now the prospective of care,</br>By loving her, the cruelst Faire that lives</br>The cruelst Fayre that sees I pine for her,</br>And never mercy to thy merit gives.</br>Let her not still triumph over the prize</br>Of mine affections taken by her eies.</br>"]
