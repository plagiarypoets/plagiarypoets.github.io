["Friend of the pensive wanderer, Twilight, hail!</br>I joy to see thee roll thy sea of clouds</br>Athwart the crimson throne</br>Of the departing sun.", "For then what various objects, dimly seen,</br>By wonder-working Fancy touch'd, acquire</br>An awe-inspiring air,</br>And urge Fear's hurried step.", "Lo!  thine attendant, the low-sailing bat,</br>Flaps his brown wing, begins his circling flight;</br>E'en Midnight's tuneful bird,</br>To hail thee, pours the strain.", "I love thy simple garb; no brilliant stars</br>Adorn thy dusky vest, unlike to that</br>Worn by thy sister Night,</br>Save when she reigns in storms.", "Nor canst thou boast the many-tinted robe</br>Worn by thy beauteous herald, dewy Eve,</br>Thine is a veil of grey,</br>Meet for the cloister'd maid.", "Thou nurse of saddening thoughts, prolong thy stay,</br>Let me adore thee still!  Eve's glowing grace,</br>Night's fire-embroider'd vest,</br>Alike displease my eye;", "For I am Sorrow's child, and thy cold showers,</br>Thy mist-encircled forms, thy doubtful shapes,</br>Wake a responsive chord</br>Within my troubled soul.", "For oh!  to me futurity appears</br>Wrapt in a chilling veil of glooms and mists,</br>Nor seems one tint or star</br>To deck her furrow'd brow,", "But slowly cross her path, imperfect shapes</br>Of danger, sorrow, frenzy, and despair,</br>Force their uneasy way,</br>And pale my cold, sunk cheek.", "But see &mdash; the unwelcome moon unveils her head,</br>(Those hours are gone in which I hail'd her beams)</br>Distinctness spreads around,</br>And mimic day appears.", "I loathe the cheerful sight, as still my fate,</br>O Twilight!  bears a hue resembling thine;</br>And envy-struck, I shun</br>The scene I cannot share.", "I'll to my couch, yet not alas to rest;</br>By artificial gloom I'll suit my soul,</br>And e'en from pity hide</br>My dim and sleepless eyes.</br>"]
