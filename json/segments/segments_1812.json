["On Shinah's plain, where David's gem appeared,</br>The star that walked yon bright serene alone,</br>Whose mystic ray the Bethlehem shepherds cheered</br>While angel-bands in blest effulgence shone,</br>With radiance flaming from the ethereal throne;</br>On Shinah's plain, where Siloa's fountains rise,</br>Whose murmuring stream glides mournful now, and lone,</br>The holy pilgrim from afar descries</br>The Tomb of JESUS, &mdash; Lord Supreme of earth and skies.", "'Twas there the Ancient of eternal Day,</br>The blest Immanuel, slumbered in the grave!</br>He whose right arm enclothed with awful sway,</br>To countless worlds their form and being gave</br>When chaos reigned, and shoreless was the wave!</br>'Tis hallowed ground &mdash; proclaim it not! &mdash; for there</br>Is crime! &mdash; Calvary, polluted by the Islam slave,</br>A scathing curse for him will wrath prepare,</br>And bolts in heaven for those who the dark traffick share!", "Oh soon may Shiloh bless the fated land,</br>The unhallowed crescent there be seen no more;</br>The lawless wanderer, with Arabia's band,</br>Forsake their prophet, and the cross adore;</br>While songs of joy resound on Jordan's shore,</br>Soon may the banner of our Jesus wave</br>On glittering heights where lofty minarets soar;</br>Nations confess that He who died to save,</br>The blest Messiah, lives and reigns for evermore!</br>"]
