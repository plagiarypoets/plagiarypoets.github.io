["Fame pluckes a pinion from the wings of Time,</br>Dips it in nectar, graves thy mighty rime</br>Within her brasen sheetes, makes envy stand</br>(Mauger her heart) and light her duskie brand:</br>Whil'st she in crimson letters writes:  These, these,</br>Shall be the whole worlds Ephemerides.", "Did not Urania loose thy fetter'd minde,</br>Out of the clayeie prison, and resign'd</br>Her place to it?  did not thy purer lay</br>Flow from the fountaine of the Milkie way?</br>Did not she dictate to thee, how to skan</br>These moneths of woe, this Almanacke of man?</br>An Almanacke that ne'er shall b' out of date,</br>But last as long as time, as firme as fate.</br>She did, (heare, envie, heare and burst) and by</br>Her staffe thou took'st the height of Poetry:</br>Th' Arcadian Shepheardes shall make thee their starre,</br>And place this next to Tityrus Calendar.", "Like to another Phoebus thous dost take</br>Thy twelvemoneths taske through lifes short Zodiacke:</br>But these are too narrow bounds for thee,</br>Each moneth's an age, each age eternitie.</br>The names, not nature's of the moneths, I see</br>Described in thy coelestial poetrie.</br>Fresh May and lusty June triumph alone</br>In thy warme breast, December there is none.</br>Envie her selfe can finde no fault but this,</br>Perfect thy moneths, thy globe imperfect is.</br>No parallell is seene in all thy spheare,</br>Besides too, no Aequator doth appear.</br>"]
