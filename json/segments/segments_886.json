["Far off remov'd from ev'ry harsher noise,</br>Here let my busy thoughts in silence rove,</br>Repeat the fleeting scenes of former joys,</br>And the soft anguish of a faithful love:</br>With just resemblance bless the gen'rous fair,</br>Renew my trembling hopes and ev'ry softer care.", "But ah!  unequal to the vast design,</br>What daring numbers shall attempt thy praise,</br>Unrival'd mind!  or sing a love like mine,</br>Immortal passion, in immortal lays.</br>Thy ev'ry charm, or my too tender heart,</br>No sacred power of words no numbers can impart.", "Form'd but to please, with ev'ry grace combin'd,</br>From beauty's charms, o'er ev'ry heart you reign,</br>But still the greater beauties of your mind,</br>Your wit and virtue form a nobler chain;</br>Hail heav'nly maid; for all must think thee so,</br>Since to be fair and good, is all of hea'n we know.&mdash;", "Ah, cruel fates, regardless of my care,</br>How could you rend her from my bleeding breast?</br>Stab smiling joy, and plunge me in despair,</br>With all the weight of love and woe oppress'd?</br>Yet still my soul the blooming form retains,</br>And there, in absence spite, the lov'd idea reigns.", "While the kind charmer bless'd my ravish'd view,</br>Extatic bliss would ev'ry thought employ,</br>On silken wings the silent moments flew,</br>Time was not known, but all was love and joy.</br>How chang'd the scene!  desponding droops my soul,</br>And clogg'd with leaden grief the ling'ring moments roll!", "When warm'd in virtue's cause, the lovely maid</br>With sweetest skill, would all its charms display,</br>Swift from my breast, the guilty passions fled,</br>And new-born peace confess'd its gentler sway,</br>Virtue from her had truths before unknown,</br>Resum'd her antient seat, and with fresh vigour shone.", "But see, far shooting thro' the dusky gloom</br>Of dark futurity, a kindly ray</br>Points out the happiness of years to come,</br>Th' unclouded prospects of a brighter day,</br>When in my fair, of all, of heav'n possess'd,</br>Joys, constant, great as theirs, shall fire my raptur'd breast.</br>"]
