["MR. WEALTHY.</br>Well!  now my dear, beloved Wife,</br>We must extend our plan of life.</br>How will our country cousins stare,</br>To see me soon a great Lord May'r!", "MRS. WEALTHY.</br>The rich State-Coach you will not grace,</br>Adorn'd by Chaplain, Sword, and Mace.</br>As for myself, the golden Chain</br>I must confess will make me vain;</br>And then how much shall be delighted,</br>When by his Majesty you're knighted!</br>Adieu now to my one horse chair,</br>I'll have a Coach to take the air.</br>With speed we'll quit vile Wormwood-Street,</br>And decorate our Country-seat;</br>The House must be entirely furnish'd,</br>And all the Glasses, gilt and burnish'd.", "MR. WEALTHY.</br>Figures I'll buy to grace the nitches,</br>And make canals of all the ditches;</br>Which, stor'd with various kinds of fish,</br>On Sundays may afford a dish,</br>The Sheriffs richly to regale,</br>With Poultry, Beef, and Yorkshire Ale.</br>Thus much I promise all my party,</br>An English welcome, rough and hearty.", "MRS. WEALTHY.</br>Indeed, my dear!  you shock my sight;</br>I fear you'll never grow polite.</br>I, to be sure, was born an heiress,</br>And fit to be a Lady-May'ress;</br>But as for you, with all your riches,</br>You wear such dirty Leather-Breeches;</br>And such a frightful shabby wig,</br>It looks like bristles of a Pig.</br>Your Day-Book and your Ledger seem,</br>To be your most engaging theme.</br>What need so often to repeat,</br>Your expectations of the Fleet!</br>And then you talk so much of Trade,</br>Boasting your debts are punctual paid:</br>Which is not now at all the fashion.", "MR. WEALTHY.</br>You really put me in a passion.</br>Politeness is an empty name:</br>On Riches I depend for fame.", "MRS. WEALTHY.</br>With all your mighty boasted wealth,</br>You neither taste of peace or health.</br>I hate extravagance and waste,</br>Yet like things in the modern taste.</br>Your Father's meanness you inherit,</br>And have no proper pride or spirit.</br>When at the Mansion-House I live,</br>Such Entertainments I will give,</br>And such a Lord-May'rs feast and ball,</br>As shall delight the crouded hall.</br>No Barbers, Clowns, or paltry Singers,</br>Or Pick-Pockets with nimble fingers,</br>But people of the first degree,</br>Shall form the brilliant company.", "MR. WEALTHY.</br>We must not break establish'd rules,</br>To banish Knaves, Poltroons, or Fools;</br>The Aldermen must hold their place,</br>And serve the Cavalcade to grace;</br>By help of whom, the Lord-May'rs day,</br>Will City consequence display;</br>The Common-Council are invited,</br>And all their families delighted.</br>Our Barges are extremely fine,</br>Bless me!  what plenty when we dine.</br>The liquor like a mighty ocean,</br>Affords an inexhaustless potion,</br>Of which we quaff like eager fish;</br>Like Cormorants attach each dish;</br>Transported by our happy fare,</br>Talk Politics, Eat, Drink, and Swear.", "MRS. WEALTHY.</br>I hate these kind of brutal feasts,</br>Less fit for Men than savage beasts;</br>Below the brute creation sunk,</br>When by intemperance they're drunk.", "MR. WEALTHY.</br>I must confess 'tis very wrong,</br>Those faults to Citizens belong;</br>We glory in our Cent. per Cent,</br>On profit ever found intent;</br>And laugh at vain ideal scheme,</br>Fictitious fancies, idle dreams,</br>Chimeras of the ton, and taste,</br>And spendthrifts fortunes soon laid waste:</br>Marking the fall and rise of stocks,</br>We keep our deeds in iron box.", "MRS. WEALTHY.</br>Pray then shall Juliet come from France?</br>On Easter-Monday how she'll dance!</br>I think my dear, we'll fetch her over;</br>Or meet he when she comes to Dover;</br>Her education is complete,</br>And for her height, 'tis near six feet.", "MR. WEALTHY.</br>How much of all her charms you boast!", "MRS. WEALTHY.</br>I could engage she'll be a toast.</br>Juliet is quit her mother's daughter,</br>And will occasion desp'rate slaughter;</br>For, as you know, when I was young,</br>My beauty did not pass unsung:</br>I always made a mighty shew,</br>And hop'd to gain an Earl or Beau.</br>But after all my care and pains,</br>My father sought substantial gains</br>And threaten'd his severe displeasure,</br>If I refus'd your worship's treasure.</br>Thus, in the prime and pride of life,</br>I was compell'd to be your wife.</br>Nor should I murmur at my lot,</br>If you your vulgar ways forgot;</br>And was for Magistracy fit,</br>With grace and dignity to sit.</br>I cannot but, my dear, declare,</br>That now I wish, you wore your Hair.</br>Your aukward Taylor has no taste;</br>Your clothes must be superbly lac'd.</br>Yet, after all, you'll look so rough,</br>To my rich gems, and silver stuff.</br>Methinks, I see the servants wait,</br>To follow us to Court in state.</br>King of the City!  what a sound!</br>Myself the Queen!  my head turns round!</br>My Daughter too, the Princess Royal!</br>I hope our subjects will be loyal.</br>Inlist in Freedom's glorious cause;</br>The surest means to gain applause.", "MR. WEALTHY.</br>Of Cash I have such wond'rous plenty,</br>That Earls or Dukes, I'd purchase twenty;</br>And therefore have no cause to spare,</br>My riches to exalt my heir:</br>So that I am resolv'd to spend,</br>My money with a cheerful friend.</br>At Newington I mean to build</br>A Drawing-Room, with pictures fill'd;</br>Then I'll pull down that odious paling,</br>And have some wooden Chinese railing;</br>That we may see the road with ease;</br>Which all our visitors will please.</br>Upon our spacious rural lawn,</br>We'll keep some sheep, and feed the fawn;</br>Some able workmen shall repair,</br>The ruins and the root-house chair.</br>I have my eye on Farmer Craddock,</br>To buy his fields to make a Paddock.</br>How very great a paddock sounds,</br>Well stor'd with deer, and flocks, and hounds!</br>When I have gain'd sufficient treasure,</br>I then will be a man of pleasure:</br>Build and rebuild, plant and lay waste,</br>Agreeable to the rules of taste;</br>The country air will make me healthy,</br>And who so great as Sir John Wealthy!</br>"]
