["The evening gun proclaims the close of day,</br>The nightly picquets to the posts retire;</br>And sternly challenge all who pass their way,</br>Nor quit their watchful stand till morning fire.", "Save, where in yonder tent together met,</br>Upon the fatness of the land to dine,</br>Staff, Captain, Sub, their thirsty whistles wet,</br>And lose each care midst good roast beef and wine.", "In front, the murder-breathing burnished arms,</br>Are now arranged in many glittering piles;</br>To rest, till trumpets sound the harsh alarms,</br>Or in the East the ruddy morning smiles.", "But now the hours of deepest midnight reign;</br>Pale o'er each tent the moon her lustre throws;</br>No longer wine inspires, a jovial strain;</br>In balmy sleep each warrior finds repose.", "In Morpheus' arms each British exile lies,</br>Unconscious of the ills of those who roam;</br>While ever busy waken'd Fancy flies,</br>And in idea tastes the joys of home.", "But ah, no home nor haunts of youthful days,</br>Delight the wanderers on Indostan's shore;</br>They roam no longer o'er the broom-clad braes,</br>The converse of their friends enjoy no more.", "No more the cheerful lark at early dawn,</br>Or heav'nly blackbird from her lonely bower,</br>Invite them forth, to tread the dewy lawn,</br>And taste the sweetness of the morning hour.", "No more at winter's eve they now retire,</br>While rages wild the wintry storm abroad,</br>Where happy circles form around the fire;</br>Their native fond remembered first abode.", "Perhaps, remote, unfriended here may lie,</br>Some bosoms formed with purest love to move;</br>Some, who entangled in the guardian-tie,</br>The faithful husband, and the friend would prove.</br>"]
