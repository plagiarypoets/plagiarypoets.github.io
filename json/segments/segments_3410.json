["Fairest daughter of the day,</br>Lovely goddess, sprightly May,</br>Hither come, with roses crown'd,</br>Painting, where you tread, the ground:</br>At the lov'd approach of thee</br>Shoots the mulb'ry, tim'rous tree,</br>Vines their tender leaves unfold,</br>Nor the figtree dreads the cold:</br>Now the flowry lote is seen;</br>Last, the stately oak is green.", "Nymph divine, behold the flow'rs</br>Rise to grace thy vernal hours:</br>Woodbinds spangled o'er with dew,</br>Deck their arborets for you:</br>Th' anemony of various dye,</br>Who, when either wind is high,</br>Hides her ever gentle face,</br>Opens to thy soft embrace:</br>See the purple Iris blow,</br>Tinged by the watry bow:</br>Tulips rear their glitt'ring heads;</br>Pinks adorn the fragrant beds;</br>And for thee the lilies swell,</br>And the golden asphodel.", "Goddess, with thy vest of green,</br>Goddess, with thy youthful mien,</br>Come and bring thy mines of wealth,</br>Gladness and her parent health:</br>Bring along thy virgin train;</br>Chase away grim care and pain.</br>Now the Loves and Graces all</br>Throng obedient to thy call.</br>See where Shakespeare's scenes arise</br>To delight th' admiring eyes;</br>Where beneath the painter's hand</br>Blooms afresh th' inchanted land;</br>Where the injur'd Lear distress'd</br>Calls the sigh from ev'ry breast;</br>Torn from Love and Hamlet's arms,</br>There the lost Ophelia charms;</br>Harry, King of English birth,</br>Seems to call forth English worth,</br>Where th' harmonious tuneful choir</br>Wake to youthful May the lyre.</br>"]
