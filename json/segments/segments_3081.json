["\"Full many a flow'r is born to blush unseen,</br>And waste its sweetness on the desert air;\"</br>Droops while its tender blossoms yet are green,</br>Nor finds the gen'rous cultivator's care.", "Full many a youth on whom fair science smil'd,</br>Repress'd by penury, unseen, unknown;</br>Whose genius cramp'd &mdash; by fortune still beguil'd,</br>Droops like yon flower, ere yet it is full-blown.", "One 'midst the rest by emulation fir'd,</br>Now seeks the soft'ning hand of wealth and worth,</br>By modest pride submissively attir'd,</br>Nor yet forgetful of his humble birth,", "To you he bends, nor let him sue in vain;</br>Be you the cultivator's lenient hand</br>To raise this drooping blossom from the plain,</br>And bid its blushing sweetness all expand.", "By worth befriended, and by fortune blest,</br>Let sweet  benevolence exert her pow'r:</br>Be you th' all chearing sun to warm his breast,</br>Then mark the progress of an op'ning FLOWER.</br>"]
