["'Tis better far to sit &mdash; to be at rest,</br>Than press the world's lorn ways with weary feet.</br>Why should we rise?  why wend to east or west?</br>The gloom of night we do but go to meet.</br>Joy flees before us:  and are we so fleet</br>That we can outrun sorrow &mdash; 'scape from woe?</br>Let the storm come and rage around our seat,</br>Come when it listeth; when it listeth, go:</br>Why should we rise to toil?  our guerdon grief we know.", "'Tis better for to sleep, than lie awake</br>Watching the silent shadows of the night.</br>'Till in the east the mournful morning break,</br>And beam through gloomy mists the hateful light.</br>We turn and toss:  and memory in her flight</br>Reads but the records of deep-graven sorrow.</br>We dare not, in the future, hope delight:</br>For bitter wisdom from the past we borrow:</br>'Tis better far to sleep, and think not of the morrow.", "But better, far than earthly rest or sleep,</br>Is that repose which waits us in the tomb:</br>Oh!  it shall be unbroken, silent, deep:</br>Repose eternal, 'mid eternal gloom:</br>Sorrow shall be no more man's daily doom;</br>The storm shall pass unheeded o'er his head;</br>And, while he slumbers in the earth's dark gloom,</br>He shall not dream of time to come, or fled.</br>Oh!  then how sweet to die, and slumber with the dead.", "\"And who doth say so? &mdash; oh!  he hath not heard</br>What the blest voice of Grace and Wisdom spoke:</br>He hath not known, or will not know, the Word:</br>And o'er his path Hope's rays have never broke:</br>Oh!  happiest they who toil, and bless the yoke,</br>Ask here no rest; and, full of cheerful faith,</br>Pass fearless 'mid the storms that hath awoke,</br>Darkling around them, the Almighty's breath:</br>These look beyond the grave, and these may welcome death.\"</br>"]
