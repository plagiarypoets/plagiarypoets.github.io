["When daisies enamel the fields,</br>And jessamine sweetens the bow'rs,</br>When Nature's rich treasure she yields,</br>And strews ev'ry valley with flowers.", "When trickling fast down from the rock,</br>The clear rivulet murmurs along,</br>The shepherd pipes sweet to his flock,</br>And the wood-lark soft carols his song.", "Delighted I range o'er the hills,</br>Or I wander at noon in the grove,</br>Or list to the purling of rills,</br>Or I sing of the maid that I love.", "I sing of her beauties, her grace,</br>That she's gentle, engaging and kind,</br>I boast that the charms of her face,</br>Are exceeded by those of her mind.", "Then fondly I haste to her cot,</br>Where I sit myself down by her side,</br>Contented and pleased with my lot,</br>How I laugh at wealth, grandeur, and pride.</br>"]
