["While twilight's sober tints pervade the scene,</br>With shadowy softness; hark!  yon solemn knell,</br>Death speaking, wafted on the air serene,</br>With gloomy horror punctuates my mind....", "EPITAPH.</br>Here lies &mdash; beneath this cold unconscious stone</br>A youth, whose pious life with lustre shone,</br>A heart &mdash; the shrine of every virtuous thought;</br>A mind &mdash; with ev'ry graceful talent fraught.</br>Inspir'd by faith, his trembling hopes arose</br>To Heaven's dread throne, the balm for earthly woes;</br>Suppress those tears, subdue those struggling sighs,</br>Ye faithful friends who sorrowing linger nigh,</br>And, stranger &mdash; thou his chaste example view.</br>Resemble him &mdash; then share his raptures too;</br>Etherial raptures fill his sainted soul;</br>His heav'nly SIRE'S reward &mdash; his long-sought goal;</br>Symphonious sounds through Heaven's blue concave rise,</br>While Angels greet him in his kindred skies.</br>"]
