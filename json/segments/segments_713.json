["That potent monarchs sway'd,</br>And valiant warriors liv'd in days of old,</br>Tho' now their memory's decay'd,</br>We still believe, howe'er obscurity told,</br>As yet unknown the Poet's sacred flame,</br>That to the hero's deeds give endless fame.", "Unlighten'd by the Muse,</br>Oblivion shrouds the honours of that age,</br>In vain another path to fame they'd chuse,</br>No power can force it, nor no worth engage.</br>From mighty Homer, thus the glory springs</br>Of great Achilles, and the King of Kings.", "But for his verse, a thousand years agon,</br>That arduous siege had been unknown to fame;</br>Immortal still his work preserves the town,</br>Tho' now low ruins point its ancient frame.</br>Tho' gods its strong foundations laid in vain,</br>Thy ILLIUM, Homer, ever shall remain!", "So vast the force of the poetic rage,</br>That glory ever waits the tuneful song,</br>Aeneas shines in Virgil's sacred page,</br>And fair Corinna is in Ovid young;</br>Eliza's fame in Spencer doth remain,</br>And Addison immoralizes Anne.", "O could my numbers reach so bold a height,</br>While burning with my country's love I shine,</br>My lays should do some patriot's virtues right,</br>Or paint a Wilkes, or else describe a Glynn.</br>To latest days transmit their glorious fame,</br>And from the shining work deserve myself a name.</br>"]
