["&mdash; whom I met in earlier day,</br>Following, as SCIENCE led the way,</br>And warmly hail'd a gen'rous name</br>Glowing with FREEDOM'S sacred flame,</br>What time, by Cam's slow-gliding stream,</br>I mus'd at ease the pensive theme;</br>Or, as in some Aonian Grove,</br>Where Bards ecstatic lov'd to rove,</br>I struck, at FANCY'S call, the Classic Lyre,</br>And felt, or seem'd to feel, some Prophet's holy fire!", "We saw no Alps in grandeur climb,</br>Nor Ocean rous'd to thought sublime,</br>No Mountain-torrents roll'd around,</br>Nor Rocks gave out the mystic sound:</br>Yet clear was Morning's earliest Light,</br>The Star of Evening mild and bright;</br>And, lofty on his mid-day throne,</br>The Sun, in beauty glorious, shone;</br>Sweet was the Gale that brush'd the wavy field,</br>And NATURE'S simplest forms could charms unnumber'd yield!", "But now no more! &mdash; for time has sped,</br>And many a golden Day-dream fled;</br>While backward as I turn my eye,</br>Friends, now no more, awake the sigh;</br>And, ah, as swift the Rivers glide,</br>To lose themselves in Ocean's tide;</br>And, as the Birds forget to sing,</br>And Trees put off the dress of Spring,</br>So thou, my Friend, art hast'ning on to death,</br>And I shall cease from Song, and soon resign my breath!", "But, rise some scenes of fresh delight&mdash;</br>Some vision'd bliss still charm my sight;</br>And, long as aught of Life shall last,</br>Let some new Day-dream chace the past;</br>Still fire me, FREEDOM'S ardent throng,</br>And fill me, soul-enchanting Song;</br>Still, FRIENDSHIP, deign with me to rest,</br>And raise your Altar in my Breast!</br>But, when the nobler Virtues cease to fire,</br>Oh, thou, ye Visions, close, and Life itself expire!</br>"]
