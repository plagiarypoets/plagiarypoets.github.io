["Down the variegated side</br>Of Edgecombe's far-recorded Knowl,</br>(Joy of Nereids, Cornwall's pride)</br>Where Art extends her mild controul</br>But just to check what Nature's liberal hand</br>Has spread in gay luxuriance wide</br>Of rocks, dells, groves, a fairy land;</br>The Muse, astonish'd, trac'd her ling'ring way,</br>Unsettled what to leave, and wond'ring where to stay.</br>"]
