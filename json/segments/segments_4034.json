["From the West, where Dee &mdash; the princely halls</br>Of Easton leaving, and its fair domains&mdash;</br>Close at my garden's foot by Cestria's walls,</br>Rolls his full tide, I turn to other plains&mdash;</br>Where, throned in rural quiet, Nature reigns;</br>And as I rove her happy scenes among,</br>Not one light sigh my gladdened spirit deigns</br>(Though some were valued) to the city-throng;</br>Here purer sweeps the breeze, here flows a softer song.", "Mark'd from my window, at the call of Spring,</br>The bursting orchard spreads its gaudiest bloom;</br>The lambkin bleats, the rook is on the wing,</br>And every twittering hedge-row breathes perfume;</br>And from each nectar'd flower ascends the hum,</br>Where clustering thick, the busy hive is met;</br>In yellow lustre glows he golden broom,</br>'Mid the dark grass the primrose-star is set,</br>And on its dewy bank sleeps the sweet violet.", "But chiefly here, thou blue-resounding main,</br>I see, I hear, as with yon rocky bar,</br>Which flings its arms athwart thy mighty reign,</br>Vainly thou wagest an eternal war;</br>Thy foamy crest is visible afar,</br>The fisher's skiff is tossing on the surge:</br>Here giant crags oppose thy billows' jar,</br>Whence their scar'd flight the screaming sea-mews urge;</br>There Scarbro's castled cliff indents the horizon's verge.", "Yet lovelier far, and welcomer to me,</br>Whom late I left in autumn's sere decay,</br>Mourning my loss &mdash; Mine own Acacia tree,</br>Thou hail'st me back in all thy green array!</br>O still thy tall and graceful stem display,</br>When He who rear'd to other worlds is gone&mdash;</br>Memorial of a master pass'd away,</br>Wave still thy boughs; in lieu of funeral stone,</br>O be his name by thee to coming days made known!</br>"]
