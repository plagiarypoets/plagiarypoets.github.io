["What sound, wide trembling on the passing gale,</br>Arrests the startled soul with sudden dread?</br>The knell of fate!  and, lo!  a victim pale</br>Borne to the silent mansions of the dead.", "'Tis he, whose bark, late driving in the breeze,</br>Rode proudly buoyant on life's swelling wave;</br>Which, while it gaily shone and mock'd the seas,</br>Sank in the treacherous whirlpool of the grave.", "See, round the corse the list'ning rustics stand,</br>In thought mysterious wrapt and holy dread;</br>While fear on every face, with livid hand,</br>Pourtrays a short resemblance with the dead.", "Lost for a while is all their former mirth,</br>And every ray that brighten'd life is gone;</br>The scenes of nature fade, while, far from earth,</br>They wander, trembling on a world unknown.", "Oh!  hear that warning voice, and dare to trust</br>In those celestial worlds in mercy given;</br>Which, while they humble man to kindred dust,</br>On Hope's strong pinions lift his soul to Heav'n.", "But fly, ye sons of Dissipation, fly</br>Th' awakening sounds, and shun intrusive care;</br>Repress the tear of grace; &mdash; the struggling sigh:</br>Nor rouse the slumbering conscience to despair.", "Fly &mdash; lest contrition from your breasts should pour</br>This prayer (which soon may flow for you and me):</br>Lord, suffer not, in this our mortal hour,</br>For any pangs of death to fall from thee.</br>"]
