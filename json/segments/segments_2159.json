["Scotland!  thy bosom nursed me &mdash; ravines dark</br>And shapeless rocks first met my youthful view,</br>And, from a child, I deemed it joy to mark</br>The majesty of nature as she drew</br>Each wild and varied scene, and changed her hue</br>With every changing season; but the wind</br>Of adverse fortune sharp and keenly blew</br>On my defenceless head, &mdash; for this I find</br>My way to climes remote, and leave thy glens behind.", "Still, Scotland!  still I love thee, and my love</br>Burns brighter as my footsteps leave thy shore&mdash;</br>Thy towering hills may rear their heads above</br>The tempests which surround them, bleak and hoar</br>Piercing the clear blue sky, though ocean roar</br>And lash around their bases; but for me</br>I may behold thy rugged wilds no more,</br>Except in slumbers, when I dream of thee</br>In a far distant land, beyond the heaving sea.", "I could have wished to linger, and contend</br>With harsh Misfortune, rather than to stray</br>To foreign realms &mdash; I could have wished to spend</br>My years where dwelt my fathers, and then lay</br>My bones beside their ashes, to decay</br>And rot with kindred dust, &mdash; while o'er my urn</br>Some aged friend might bend with tresses grey,</br>And, for the love I bore him, weep and mourn;</br>But fate forbids &mdash; I go, and never may return.", "Though India's sky be milder &mdash; though the breeze</br>Satiate the senses, breathing with perfume&mdash;</br>Though the fruits drop with richness from the trees,</br>And variegated flowers successive bloom</br>In endless beauty, shall my soul resume</br>Far from my native soil its wonted tone?</br>No, sunk in speechless grief and hid in gloom,</br>Remember scenes of pleasure past and gone,</br>I'll lay me down, and die forgotten and unknown.</br>"]
