["Unjust defamer of a gen'rous  youth,</br>False to the sacred confidence of love,</br>To say that Thyrsis wrong'd with doubt my truth,</br>And pray'd thy arts, my passion's strength to prove.</br>To prove a faithful heart he long had known,</br>Fix'd by the noblest ties to him alone.", "A thousand dear occasions have display'd</br>The pure effusions of a lasting fire;</br>And oft has gentle Thyrsis fondly said,</br>He knew my flame would but with life expire.</br>Then can I think, with mean dissembling art,</br>He sought thy frauds to practice on my heart.", "When languid sickness chac'd his rosy hue,</br>And dim'd the lustre of his radiant eyes,</br>Still was my aching breast to Thyrsis true,</br>And seem'd e'en more his fading charms to prize:</br>Nor could the slaving victims of thy rage,</br>Tho' lost their auburn beauty, less engage.", "Ah!  well I know what first provok'd thy spite</br>And made my Thyrsis early feel thy pow'r,</br>&mdash;Where bless'd with him I heeded not thy slight,</br>And in his absence loath'd each tardy hour.</br>This made his tresses dear thy vengeful sway,</br>This brought thy snows on manhood's blooming May.", "But try thy utmost, tyrant!  to debase</br>The various graces of that wond'rous form;</br>Let deep indentures mark his lovely face,</br>And youth's bold tide his veins no longer warm;</br>Till thou canst sully his angelic mind,</br>Love's rosy charms will still my bosom bind.</br>"]
