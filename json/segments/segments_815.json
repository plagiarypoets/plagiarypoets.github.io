["Ah me!  the luckless chime</br>I little counted, for I simply thought;</br>Nor deem'd, that Heav'n did note</br>The wrecks of Time!</br>But ah!  the hour is past!</br>The hour, which never cease to weep</br>Fair Liberty, all light of wing;</br>The Muses, ever wont to sing;</br>All as they pensive tread the mountain-steep!</br>And could I bid all peace to thy fair Shade&mdash;</br>A Greet, of stop too high for shepherd's straw,</br>Whose uncouth yearnings use an humbler strain;</br>I would the bold full-passion'd plain',</br>Sacred to Wonder, and to Sorrow too!</br>Wou'd I might sweep the antic wilde,</br>'Mong holy tow'rs, by Time unpil'd;</br>Whose reliques, shew'd in moon-beam light,</br>Pity might teare to Sickness quite!</br>&mdash;Or view the princely heaped tomb,</br>That Wonder deigns to look upon,</br>The Pyramid &mdash; whence might be sought</br>Tall Metaphor, and gloomy Thought,</br>And toily Plan that Grief hath wrought!", "&mdash;Or to some mountain I wou'd up,</br>Where torrents tumble from the top;</br>Now peep at sky, in fiery show;</br>Now see the high-voic'd waves below!</br>While peopled hulks are whembling by,</br>And store of fragments beating high,</br>I'd catch a new-felt sympathy!</br>The grain might then full well proportion'd be;</br>Not simply sullen shou'd it move,</br>But bolt, as thunder from above!</br>Or like the light'ning it shou'd blaze,</br>Full fancy fire the orb in which it plays!</br>The Muse shou'd then &mdash; a Mourner come;</br>All sable-clad shou'd slow stalk on,</br>In stately sad solemnity!", "But well I ween,</br>Thy Passing dirged by the starry tribe,</br>All as thou mak'st full wing, to gladly gain</br>Yon higher seat of Fame!</br>What boots thee then an earthly fame beside!</br>Yet O!  let this fair Eulogy be taught,</br>Which kings may blush to hear \"twas Peace he sought,</br>A Prince, who bold in Faith, to Fame's tribunal came;</br>Car'd to be good &mdash; the rest he left to Fame.\"</br>"]
