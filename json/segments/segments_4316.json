["Ye fond desires!  that flush the purple cheek,</br>And revel in the sunny eye of Joy!</br>Ye melting Looks!  that Love's soft language speek,</br>Divinest rhetoric you can employ;</br>Ye sighs!  that from the blissful bosom break,</br>With not unpleasing, amorous annoy;</br>Farewell: &mdash; and quickly catch the white-wing'd hour,</br>Ere fell Despair, ungracious fiend!  destroy</br>Affection's soft recess, and Rapture's rosey bow'r.", "For ever, silent be my sylvan flute,</br>Which COLIN'S tuneful lip did, erst, inspire;</br>No more may it the grey-ey'd Morn salute;</br>Or lead the jocund Eve-star's sheeny Quire;</br>Ye fays!  for ever more your minstrel's mute:</br>So, sit ye, songless, by the glow-worm's fire;</br>Or hide beneath the mountain's misty brow;</br>Or to the copse's cheerless depth retire:</br>Ah me!  I have no heart for elphin-pastime now!", "Sore is my sorrow, and beyond repair:</br>Of all the nymphs that blest those ardent eyes,</br>She was, in sooth, the most bewitching fair,</br>And might be deem'd an Inmate of the Skies;</br>What modest graces mark'd her angel-air,</br>With sweet unconscious charm, which mock'd disguise,</br>And round her lucent form, resistless, spread?</br>Ye fond Desires!  ye melting Looks!  ye Sighs!</br>Farewell! &mdash; from transport's fold my long-lov'd MARY'S fled.</br>"]
