["'Twas noontide &mdash; and, breathless beneath the hot ray,</br>The far-winding vales of the wilderness lay:</br>By the Koonap's lone brink, with the cool shadow o'er me,</br>I slept &mdash; and a Dream spread its visions before me.", "Methought, among scenes which I loved when a boy,</br>I was walking again, with young feelings of joy;</br>For my soul, like the landscape, seem'd soften'd and chang'd</br>To what it was once, when in childhood I ranged</br>Those fair haunts, to gather the bright summer flowers,</br>Or chase, with fond rapture, the birds through the bowers.</br>&mdash;On my dreaming ear waters were murmuring still,</br>But the wild foreign river had shrunk to a rill;</br>And Caha's dark mountains had melted away;</br>And the brown thorny desert, where antelopes stray,</br>Had become a sweet glen, where the young lambs were racing,</br>And yellow-hair'd children the butterflies chasing:</br>And the meadows were gemm'd with the primrose and gowan;</br>And the ferny braes fringed with the hazel and rowan;</br>And the foxglove look'd out from the oziers dank;</br>And the wild-thyme and violet breath'd from the bank.</br>&mdash;And green shelter'd glades 'mid the landscape were seen,</br>Half hid by the grey rocks, that high o'er them lean,</br>Where the light birch above its loose tresses was waving,</br>And the willow below in the blue stream was laving</br>Its silvery garlands of soft downy buds:</br>And the mellow thrush sang to his mate in the woods;</br>And the brood of the wild-duck plash'd over the pool,</br>New-fledg'd from their nest, 'mong the well-cresses cool.</br>&mdash;And trouts from the limpid stream lightly were springing;</br>And larks in the dewy air merrily singing;</br>And down in the copsewood the cushat was cooing;</br>And high o'er the moorland the huntsman hallooing;</br>The pipe of the shepherd was heard from the mountain,</br>And the milk-maiden's carol replied from the fountain:</br>With the lowing of herds from the broom-blossom'd lea;</br>'The cuckoo's soft not from the old beechen tree;</br>The waving of woods in the balm-breathing gale;</br>The dash of the mill-wheel afar down the vale:</br>&mdash;All these were around me: &mdash; and with them there came</br>Sweet voices, that call'd me aloud by my name,&mdash;</br>And looks of affection from innocent eyes,&mdash;</br>And light-hearted laughter, &mdash; and shrill joyous cries:</br>And I saw the mild features of all that were there,</br>Unalter'd by years, and unclouded by care!", "Then it seem'd as that scene slowly melted away,</br>Like the bright cloud of morn in a midsummer's day;</br>And I lost the blithe sounds of the pastoral glen,</br>'Mid the rattle of wheels, and loud murmurs of men.</br>&mdash;I stood on a mount, and saw, towering around,</br>A proud ancient city, with palaces crown'd;</br>Where statesmen and heroes seem'd passing along,</br>With poets and sages &mdash; a glorious throng!</br>I heard, from on high, the loud heralds proclaim,</br>With their silver-toned voices, each patriot name;</br>I mark'd, yet afar, their mild dignified mien,</br>And their aspect benevolent, simple, serene;</br>And linger'd, in heart-greeting silence, to gaze</br>On the faces of those I had lov'd in their lays.</br>&mdash;But these feelings were brief; for, as closer they came,</br>Their bearing and looks seem'd no longer the same;</br>And features, that distance had soften'd or veil'd,</br>Grew harsh and distinct, till I shudder'd and quail'd&mdash;</br>Disturb'd with dark thoughts, like the heavings of ocean,</br>When it feels, amid calm, the far-coming commotion!", "&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;", "Then the visionary pageant again seem'd to change,</br>And a land lay before me, of aspect strange&mdash;</br>Where the tumult of voices disturb'd me no more,</br>But I heard the hoarse surf dashing wild on the shore,</br>As bewilder'd I stood.  Yet, I was not alone;</br>For still, amid crowds, my Dream pass'd on:</br>Mid crowds &mdash; but silent, and sad as death;</br>For it seem'd as if each man held his breath,</br>And cower'd with his body, in mortal fear,</br>Like a caitiff beneath the conqueror's spear.</br>&mdash;Then I turn'd, and lifted my wondering eye,</br>And beheld a grim Spectre enthron'd on high,</br>And his name, it was written &mdash; TYRRANY!</br>I gazed &mdash; and beheld how his scourge-bearing hand</br>Was high outstretch'd o'er the shuddering land;</br>And his eyes, that like those of the basilisk shone,</br>Blasted whatever they glared upon.</br>&mdash;Yet crowds of votaries, kneeling around,</br>Were worshipping him, with a whispering sound;</br>And, ever and anon, his priests on high</br>Hymn'd forth his praises to the sky.</br>&mdash;Full many a race lay mingled there:</br>Swart Afric's tribes with their wooly hair,</br>The enslav'd Madegass, and dejected Malay,</br>And degenerate Belgian, slavish as they,</br>Prone and promiscuous round him lay.</br>As I drew more near, 'mid the suppliant train,</br>My heart swell'd high, with grief and pain,</br>Proud England's children there to view,</br>Commingled with that crouching crew:</br>And I marvell'd much that no manly hand</br>Was rais'd to redeem the desolate land;</br>For I saw that the monster's magic mould,</br>Though braced with iron and bound with gold,</br>Was fram'd but of base and crumbling dust,</br>Unfit to withstand the avenger's thrust.</br>&mdash;While thus I was musing, a crashing stroke,</br>As when the red lightning shivers the rock,</br>Fell! &mdash; And I started and awoke!", "Awaking, I heard but the wild river sounding;</br>I gaz'd, but saw only the klip-springer bounding;</br>And the eagle of Winterberg, high o'er the woods,</br>Sailing supreme, 'mid his still solitudes.</br>"]
