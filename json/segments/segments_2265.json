["There's something sweet in sitting thus alone,</br>Thinking of hearts, alas!  which beat  no more&mdash;</br>'Till fancy peopleth with their voice the moan</br>The night-breeze makes, as with the poplar hoar</br>It passing struggles: &mdash; on the pebbly shore</br>Seated at night, when winds and waves were still,</br>I've thus thus the dark stream, whispering evermore</br>While lapsing to the ocean, heard &mdash; at will</br>Would I could wake such strains as now my spirit fill!", "I listen to the wind &mdash; it speaks of days</br>Of youthful study and of youthful bliss,</br>When the wild, deep, deep-rooted thirst of praise</br>Was wakened first on such a night as this&mdash;</br>When wandering forth from sports I well could miss,</br>I saw the bright round moon in purest sky,</br>Listening the sea's blue wavelets curling kiss</br>The silver shore, which to my raptured eye</br>Stretched glittering far and wide in heaven's bright panoply.", "Gods!  there is inspiration in the night!</br>Unknown, uncherished in the busy hour,</br>When all things walk abroad by common light,</br>And bound upon the turf, or crop the flower</br>Of day; now purer thoughts exert their power</br>With simple, perfect, undistracted sway:</br>Night stilleth those rude cares that would devour</br>Our soft serenity, and drives away</br>Those useless sluggish drones, who waste our hours by day.", "Now muster round the awful shades of those</br>I might have loved, alive &mdash; and worship, dead;</br>And each great spirit, as it flitting goes</br>Back to the world of night, a thrilling dread,</br>Severely pleasing, leaves:  I bow my head</br>To all and each of this immortal throng;</br>Hoping &mdash; vain thought! &mdash; that when my earthly bed</br>Receives me, then this mighty train among</br>I too may walk, a sprite immortalized by song!</br>"]
