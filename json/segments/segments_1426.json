["Oh Warton!  to thy soothing shell,</br>Stretched remote in hermit cell,</br>Where the brook runs babbling by,</br>For ever I could listening lie;</br>And catching all the muses' fire,</br>Hold converse with the tuneful quire.", "What pleasing themes thy page adorn!</br>The ruddy streaks of cheerful morn,</br>The pastoral pipe, the ode sublime,</br>And melancholy's mournful chime,</br>Each with unwonted graces shines</br>In thy ever lovely lines.", "Thy muse deserves the lasting meed;</br>Attuning sweet the Dorian reed,</br>Now the lovelorn swain complains,</br>And sings his sorrows to the plains;</br>Now the sylvan scenes appear</br>Through all the changes of the year;</br>Or the elegiac strain</br>Softly sings of mental pain,</br>And mournful diapasons sail</br>On the faintly-dying gale.", "But ah!  the soothing scene is o'er!</br>On middle flight we cease to soar,</br>For now the Muse assumes a bolder sweep,</br>Strikes on the lyric string her sorrows deep,</br>In strains unheard before.</br>Now, now the rising fire thrills high,</br>Now, now to heaven's high realms we fly,</br>And every throne explore;</br>The soul entranced, on mighty wings,</br>With all the poet's heat, up springs,</br>And loses earthly woes;</br>Till all alarm'd at the giddy height,</br>The Muse descends on gentler flight,</br>And lulls the wearied soul to soft repose.</br>"]
