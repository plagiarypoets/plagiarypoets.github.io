["When arts and arms, beneath ELIZA's smile,</br>Spred wide their influence o'er this happy isle;</br>A golden reign, uncurs'd with party-rage,</br>That foe to taste, and tyrant of our age;</br>Ere all our learning in a libel lay,</br>And all our talk, in politics, or play:</br>The stateman oft would soothe his toils with wit,</br>What SPENCER  sung, and nature's SHAKESPEAR writ;</br>Or to the laurel'd grove, at times, retire,</br>There, woo the Muse, and wake the moving lyre.", "As fair examples, like ascending morn,</br>The world at once enlighten and adorn;</br>From them diffus'd, the gentle arts of peace</br>Shot brightning o'er the land, and swift encrease:</br>Rough nature soften'd into grace and ease;</br>Sense grew polite, and science sought to please.", "Reliev'd from yon rude Scene of party-din,</br>Where open baseness vys with secret sin,</br>And safe embower'd in WOBURN'S airy groves,</br>Let us recall the times our taste approves;</br>Awaken to our aid the mourning Muse;</br>Thro every bosom tender thought infuse;</br>Melt angry faction into moral sense,</br>And to his guests a BEDFORD'S soul dispense.", "And now, while Spring extends her smiling reign,</br>Green on the mountain, flowery in the plain;</br>While genial Nature breathes, from hill and dale,</br>Health, fragrance, gladness, in the living gale;</br>The various softness, stealing thro the heart,</br>Impressions, sweetly social, will impart.", "When sad EUDOCIA pours her hopeless woe,</br>The tear of pity will unbidden flow!</br>When erring PHOCYAS, whom wild passions blind,</br>Holds up himself, a mirror for mankind;</br>An equal eye on our own hearts we turn,</br>Where frailties lurk, where fond affections burn:</br>And conscious, Nature is all the same,</br>We mourn the guilty, while the guilt we blame!</br>"]
