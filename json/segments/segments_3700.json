["Ye shepherds and nymphs of the plain,</br>To whom the glad moments belong;</br>Come cheerfully join in the strain,</br>And echo with pleasure my song;</br>The tabor and pipe's sprightly sound,</br>Shall gladness dispense through the grove,</br>The day shall with rapture be crown'd,</br>'Tis sacred to Laura and love.", "For Laura, the pride of the dale,</br>Young Corydon claims as his bride;</br>With pleasure I dwell on the tale,</br>And see, where she comes by his side.</br>She comes in her bridal array,</br>'Tis elegant, simple and neat,</br>How the looks of each swain seem to say,</br>Dear Maid, I could die at your feet!", "But haste!  the soft flutes breathe around,</br>Whilst onward the virgins all move,</br>Who strew with fresh flowrets the ground,</br>To grace the procession of love;</br>To still as she journies through life,</br>May flowrets be strew'd in her way;</br>And no thorn, luckless emblem of strife,</br>One painful sensation convey!</br>"]
