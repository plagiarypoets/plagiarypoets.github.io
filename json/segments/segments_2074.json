["A Pensive sadness overwhelms my soul,</br>And fills my mind with melancholy dread;</br>For, hark!  I hear the dismal, aweful toll,</br>Which lends my thoughts to contemplate the dead.", "Perhaps some gay Lothario now is laid</br>\"In narrow cell,\" and freed from mortal care;</br>Perhaps some charming, artless, lovely maid,</br>Her sex's pride, the fairest of the fair.", "Ah!  what is beauty?  what is elegance?</br>What is the radiance of the brightest eye?</br>When Death begins to lead the dreadful dance,</br>We turn to dust, and are but vanity!", "Say, can bright Beauty's magic powers save</br>Its lov'd possessor from the loathsome tomb?</br>Or, while Ambition's colours round us wave,</br>Can we escape th' inevitable doom?", "Nor wealth, nor honours, nor proud looks avail;</br>Inexorable Death no favour shews;</br>We all must travel thro' the gloomy vale</br>That leads to endless joys or endless owes.</br>"]
