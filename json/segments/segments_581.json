["What, Celia, should we blame our Stars, that they</br>Our Loves or interrupt or separate;</br>Or cruelty combine their partial Sway,</br>To make our mutual Joys the less compleat?</br>Our Stars themselves know Change as well as we,</br>And sudden Clouds their spangled Glories hide,</br>Yet soon those Clouds withdraw, and then we see,</br>Again they triumph and resume their Pride:</br>The same vicissitude all Nature shares,</br>Dies and revives, looks gay or gloomy, like the Stars.", "Tho' Winter Frosts deform the blest Retreat</br>Of rural Innocence and artless Love;</br>And drive the Turtle from his constant Mate,</br>Alone to wander thro' the leafless Grove;</br>Yet soon as genial Spring renews the Shade,</br>Beneath the wonted Bower the Lover tells</br>His mighty Anquish to the listning Maid,</br>While she in Blushes all her Flame reveals.</br>The Turtle mourns his Solitude no more,</br>But woo's his Mate, and bills as closely as before.", "While am'rous THAMES thro' many a winding, wooes</br>The briny THETIS to his ouzy Bed,</br>The conscious Goddess owns his faithful Vows,</br>And in her Bosom folds her dewy Head;</br>But at the Moon's Command flies far away,</br>Severe her Laws the rigid Planet keeps,</br>And the unwilling Lovers must obey,</br>The Goddess murmurs and the River weeps;</br>Till at ther gracious Nod they rush amain,</br>And loose their blending Streams in boundless Joys again.", "Then think not, Celia, Pleasure is no more,</br>Nor of our present hapless Lot complain;</br>Another Change will our past Joys restore,</br>And we shall live to meet, and love again.</br>As well may pious Saints bemoan their Fate,</br>When they are summon'd to resign their Breath,</br>And leave the Pleasures of a mortal State,</br>Th' wander in the dreary Vale of Death:</br>But oh, blest Change!  when once the Pilgrims prove,</br>The Musick of the Spheres, and taste SERAPHIC LOVE!</br>"]
