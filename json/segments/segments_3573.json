["Absence, the foe of every fond desire,</br>Prolongs its stay, and robs my soul of rest;</br>Yet absence vainly strives to quench the fire,</br>Almighty love has kindled in my breast.</br>What can her presence than her absence more?</br>Absent, my thoughts are fix'd on her alone:</br>Present, I could but silently adore,</br>To the sweet maid my passion is unknown:</br>But whether here she bides or far away,</br>My heart, soul, thoughts, with her, and her alone must stay.", "Rise shades of darkness, rise, and quench the light:</br>When she's away, no lack of day I find;</br>More dear to me the sable veil of night,</br>Her image solely then employs my mind;</br>No other object then can intervene</br>To rob my soul of that sublime delight;</br>When by these eyes the fair one is not seen,</br>Oh!  what avails to me the use of sight?</br>She, she alone, should every sense employ,</br>She, who to every sense can yield the purest joy.</br>"]
