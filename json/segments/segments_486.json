["Hail meek-ey'd maiden, clad in sober grey,</br>Whose soft approach the weary woodman loves,</br>As homeward bent to kiss his prattling babes,</br>He jocund whistles thro' the twilight groves.", "When PHOEBUS sinks behind the gilded hills,</br>You lightly o'er the misty meadows walk,</br>The drooping daisies bathe in dulcet dews,</br>And nurse the nodding violet's slender stalk:", "The panting Dryads, that in day's fierce heat</br>To inmost bowers and cooling caverns ran,</br>Return to trip in wanton evening-dance,</br>Old SYLVAN too returns, and laughing PAN.", "To the deep wood the clamorous rooks repair,</br>Light skims the swallow o'er the wat'ry scene,</br>And from the sheep-cotes, and fresh-furrow'd field,</br>Stout plowmen meet to wrestle on the green.", "The swain that artless sings on yonder rock,</br>His nibbling sheep and lengthening shadow spies,</br>Pleas'd with the cool, the calm, refreshful hour,</br>And with hoarse hummings of unnumber'd flies.", "Now every passion sleeps; desponding Love,</br>And pining Envy, ever-restless Pride;</br>An holy calm creeps o'er my peaceful soul,</br>Anger and mad Ambition's storms subside.", "O modest EVENING, oft' let me appear</br>A wandering votary in thy pensive train,</br>List'ning to every wildly-warbling throat</br>That fills with farewell notes the dark'ning plain.</br>"]
