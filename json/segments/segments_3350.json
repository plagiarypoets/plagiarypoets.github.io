["How sweetly the moments all flew!</br>They are past, and return not again,</br>Yes!  sweet were the pleasures I knew,</br>When, Lucy, gave charms to the plain.", "Return ye dear moments, return!</br>The Peace of my mind you'll restore;</br>For, Lucy, I languish and burn,</br>And must I then see her no more:", "No more the dear maid must I see,</br>My heart sure with anguish will break;</br>The world has no pleasures for me,</br>Or none that my heart can partake:", "In vain to forget her I strive;</br>No time can my passion remove,</br>While memory keeps it alive,</br>And shews me the maid that I love.</br>"]
