["Rotund, or oval, in whatever form,</br>My jocund eyes thy pleasing presence meet,</br>Hail, bounteous Pudding!  hot, or cold, all hail!</br>Whether my blue-eyed Kate, with lily hand,</br>In simple neatness eminent, whose smile</br>Is love ineffable, into thy lap</br>Insueth store of Eggs, and spicy Sweets</br>Whose fragrance is inferior to herself;</br>Or whether Joan, in woolly Vestment clad,</br>Dwelling in Straw-thatcht Cott, with busy glee</br>Thy composition kneads, and fills thy Cave</br>With golden Pomes profuse, or leaves thee coarse,</br>Of Suet, Butter, and aught else devoid</br>Tending to flavour, serv'd in wooden Bowl.</br>Oh!  welcome thou, mine Appetite's best Guest;</br>Whether the Oven's heat embrowns thy Crust,</br>With Sugar frosted, crumbling at the touch;</br>Or whether thou in ragged Clout enwrap'd</br>Hast felt the boiling Tempest of the Pot.</br>But chiefly come, and deck mine humble Cloth</br>With all the rich magnificence of Plumbs</br>Array'd most gorgeously, whilst down thy sides</br>Hot melted Butter rolls its golden wave,</br>As amorous of thy charms.  Here might the Sons</br>Of Luxury deprav'd look on with Eyes</br>That envy'd, while they gaz'd.  Give me but this,</br>And let the bloated Alderman devour</br>Turtle, that boasts diversity of food,</br>And rarest dainties, still more dainty made,</br>By being tortured from their native taste.</br>I shall not grudge their feast.  Be Pudding mine</br>And I can pass yon celebrated stall,</br>Where the firm Salmon tempts the greedy eye</br>Of stopping Passenger, and where the sight,</br>\"Nor cast one longing lingring look behind.\"</br>"]
