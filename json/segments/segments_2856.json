["Within yon Cottage humbly wall'd with Clay,</br>And standing lonely by the Church-Yard Side,</br>A simple Rustic dwells, who knows no Guile,</br>No Friend to Luxury, or saucy Pride.", "Artless his Language is, and plain his Dress,</br>And to his Shoulders graceful flows his Hair,</br>Comb'd smooth on Sundays, when his Duty calls</br>To strengthen with Amen the Parson's Prayer.", "Loud in the Church his well-known Voice is heard,</br>Chaunting with pious Thought Old Sternhold's Strains,</br>Whilst many a Voice ill-tun'd in Chorus joins,</br>Gladd'ning his Heart, and paying well his Pains.", "When the neat Village Maid, with modest Look,</br>With her lov'd Swain in Wedlock's Bands is join'd,</br>Gravely He stands, attentive to the Rite,</br>Nor strikes one wanton Thought across his Mind.", "And when within the cold and dreary Grave,</br>His Rustic Neighbour or his Friend is laid,</br>Careful he sees each Duty well perform'd,</br>Nor fails to wish a Requiem to the Shade.", "Nor is He Foe to Mirth, but oft at Eve,</br>When Youths and Maidens dance upon the Green,</br>Or round the Maypole, where at Season due,</br>Suspended high the flow'ry Garland's seen,", "Then whilst with nimble Steps the Ground They beat,</br>Whilst merrily the Pipe and Tabor sound,</br>Pleas'd at the harmless Pastime, He stands by,</br>And sportive jests with all the Damsels round.", "To Him the Tenets of the Schools unknown,</br>He by the Parson's Rules his Actions guides,</br>Those Rules he can deduce from Holy Writ,</br>And on his Skill therein himself He prides.", "Frequent on Sundays, when the Sermon's done,</br>Along the Church-way Path He gravely walks,</br>And 'midst a Circle of unletter'd Swains,</br>Expounds the Sermon, and of Scripture talks.", "Then home returning to the cleanly Hut,</br>(Which speaks the Housewife's neatness and her care)</br>There sings a Psalm, to pass the Sacred Eve,</br>Whilst round his Children silent sit to hear.</br>"]
