["Amid the garden's fragrance laid,</br>Where yonder limes behold their shade</br>Along the glassy stream,</br>With HORACE and his tuneful ease</br>I'll rest from crouds, and care's disease,</br>And summer's piercing beam.", "Behold the busy, wand'ring BEE!</br>From bloom to bloom, from tree to tree</br>She sweeps mellifluous dews;</br>For her the silken gems arise,</br>For her display their shinking dyes,</br>Their balmy breath diffuse.", "Sweet Murmurer!  may no rude storm</br>This pleasurable scene deform</br>To check thy gladsome toils;</br>Still may the buds unsullied spring,</br>Still flow'rs and sunshine court thy wing</br>To these ambrosial spoils.", "Nor shall my Muse hereafter fail</br>Her fellow-lab'rer thus to hail,</br>And lucky be the strains!</br>For long ago did nature frame</br>Your seasons and your arts the same,</br>Your pleasures and your pains.", "Like thee, in lowly, sylvan scenes,</br>And river-banks and fruitful greens</br>Delights my vagrant song;</br>Nor strives by soaring high in air,</br>Tho' swans and eagles triumph there,</br>To draw the giddy throng.", "Nor where the raven, where the owl</br>By night their hateful orgies howl,</br>Will she her cares imploy;</br>But flies from ruins and from graves,</br>From ghostly cells and monkish caves</br>To day-light and to joy.", "Nor will she tempt the barren waste;</br>Nor deigns th' ungrateful stores to taste</br>Of any noxious thing;</br>But leaves with scorn to others' use</br>The bitter hemlock's baneful juice,</br>The nettle's sordid sting.", "From all which nature fairest knows,</br>The vernal blooms, the summer rose,</br>She draws her mingled wealth;</br>And when the lovely task is done,</br>She consecrates a double boon,</br>To pleasure and to health.</br>"]
