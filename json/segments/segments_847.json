["Marriage!  forbear, thou rash ungarded youth!</br>Attend the friendly precepts of the muse:</br>She dares unfold the harsh unwelcome truth,</br>To curb thy fires, and check thy ardent views;</br>Dissolves the magic charm that lures thine eye,</br>Where pangs and sharp remorse in treach'rous ambush lie.", "Of mystic rapture, tho' thy favour'd eye</br>Have drunk deep draughts at many a transient view;</br>These visionary charms too soon will die,</br>No longer pleasing, when no longer new.</br>O!  vain to hope these fleeting joys shall last,</br>When novel days, and weeks, and honey-moon are past!", "And tho' with skill she drive the pointed steel,</br>And many a selvedge runs with busy speed:</br>Can selvedges divert the pangs you feel,</br>When clouded comes the dismal hour of need?</br>When dear earn'd shillings fly ten thousand ways,</br>In shape of caps, and cloaks, and stockings, shoes, and stays?", "And if in song she charm thy ravish'd ear,</br>And trip it graceful in the mazy dance;</br>What strain, what step, may sooth thy fate severe,</br>When dreary winter's shiv'ring months advance?</br>Joyous no more to share in flowing bowls,</br>Now doom'd to curse the cost of candles, and of coals!", "How beats thine heart, when fashion's changeful laws</br>Enjoin new modes, and each frail female shines,</br>With tow'ring head-dress rich in flowing gauze?&mdash;</br>To join the giddy throng thy partner pines;</br>With eager zeal to shew an early taste,</br>In Folly's num'rous train she grieves to list the last.", "When Summer-sabbath crowns the lagging week,</br>And ruddy Phoebus gilds the landscape round,</br>Then spruce acquaintance shall thy table seek,</br>And gossip neighbours at thy board be found:</br>Succeeds a lengthful train, unknown before,</br>Aunts, cousins, sisters, nieces, drain thy conjugal store.", "But O!  what pen may paint the pure delight,</br>When wealth, when virtue, lasting bliss insures;</br>When youthful beauty waits the hallow'd rite,</br>And parent's willing voice the boon secures.</br>Not here the muse pours forth her sorrowing song,</br>To this auspicious theme her gayest notes belong!</br>"]
