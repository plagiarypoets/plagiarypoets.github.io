["Of Old, in Scottish land, a Sire there lived,</br>Whose toil in youth had stores prepared for age,</br>Who now from care, though scarce from toil reprieved,</br>With earthly thoughts an easier war could wage,</br>And lest of fear or favour felt the edge:</br>His children grown, had sought employment round,</br>As different toils their various tastes engage,</br>And he, though scarce by need to labour bound,</br>Yet loved to tend his team, and till the fruitful ground.", "On slope of sunward hill his cot was placed,</br>In cultured holm, 'mid furze-surrounded scene,</br>Where isles of corn were gained from Alpine waste,</br>And 'mid enclosing rocks were pastures seen;</br>Before his door was spread the daisied green,</br>Where browzed the cottage nurse, his brinded cow,</br>By grandchild led, the furzy knolls between,</br>Who sought the spots where sweetest daisies grow,</br>And lesson conned the while, along that mountain's brow.", "That wealthy cot of rude exterior seemed,</br>Its charms the dwellers, not the gazers, found;</br>In eyes romantic scarce befitting deemed,</br>To grace the blooming wilds that laughed around:</br>And all within to antique modes was bound;</br>The hearth amid the central floor was placed,</br>Where sire and sons might sit in circle round;</br>And up the spacious vent, with wicker braced,</br>Might school-boy grandchild mark each zenith star that passed.", "One southward window looked adown the green,</br>Where wont his daughter young her wheel to ply,</br>And view the roses round her casement sheen,</br>Or tulips bright in tidy garden nigh,</br>Whose flowers might Sunday's ornament supply,</br>Or lie, for mark, beside her pastor's hymn;</br>Here too, when snowy loured December's sky,</br>She lov'd to see, through window frosted-dim,</br>The blackbirds peck her crumbs, or round her garden skim.", "To fairy lake was there a streamlet spread,</br>Whose grassy banks were bright with purest green,</br>And here, when June his brightening influence shed,</br>The housewife's pearly webs were bleaching seen,</br>From seed to cloth that still her care had been;</br>There, too, the maid betrothed might stranger view,</br>In satin snood and kilted kirtle clean,</br>Her linen stores prepare, of lilied hue,</br>Pure like her virgin self, the married couch to strew.", "Apart, on airy knoll, his stacks were seen,</br>Y-thatched with broom, with twisted sedges bound;</br>And garden here was stretched in chequered green,</br>With ranks of leafy trees protected round;</br>And here his leisure hours employment found&mdash;</br>To tend the sunny hives, the soil to feed,</br>For various plants to fit the equal ground,</br>To trim the walk, to root the envious weed,</br>Or rill, by sedges choked, in purer stream to lead.", "Here, too, on Sunday morn, in corner green,</br>Where branching lime her shadowy arches raised,</br>He loved to sit:  where through the leafy screen</br>The humming bees, with honeyed blossoms pleased,</br>Like hymn from distant church, innumerous praised</br>The God to whom his morning prayers were said;</br>And here, at times, from weekly tasks released,</br>Around his knee, his youthful grandsons played,</br>Or glad in sacred lore their infant skill displayed.", "This wight's fair fame the Elder's charge had won,</br>And well his equal life such trust approved&mdash;</br>By haughtiest wealth as independent known,</br>By poorest toil as fellow labourer loved;</br>His praise was dear to all; if he reproved,</br>Nor frowned the rich, nor jealous railed the poor:</br>From him whose life in equal toils has moved,</br>Will poverty severest truths endure,</br>And who, nor needs nor fears, with wealth shall chide secure.", "The reverend man my earlier years have seen,</br>On Sunday morn the church-way gate beside,</br>(An antique porch, with fry mantled green,</br>By beech's earliest boughs o'ershadowed wide,)</br>There stood the Patriarch gray, and near his aide</br>The entering peasants laid their friendly mite</br>For brethren's wants:  while each, with grateful pride,</br>From his applauding eye the warm delight</br>Received, of charity \"twice blessed,\" of kindness done aright.", "I've seen him, too, at times the boon divide,</br>By pitying brethren thus collected kind,</br>Yet few were those, I wot, whom kindred's pride</br>To general pity careless then resigned&mdash;</br>For not as now was wealth to few confined,</br>Who owned no kindred tie with lowlier toil&mdash;</br>But far diffused; each peasant then could find,</br>(While smaller farms left free th' enriching soil)</br>Some kind relation near, whose wealth relieved his coil.", "Yet those whom poverty reluctant sent,</br>With kindest care the Elder's hand relieved,</br>As patriarch old within his evening tent,</br>The pilgrim's wearied footsteps glad received;</br>No fears were there, lest charity deceived,</br>Should nourish listless vice with boon prepared</br>For humble want; in equal toils had lived,</br>Both he who dealt and he the boon that shared,</br>And wasting idler there, of welcome still despaired.", "Bright from his cottage lay, far stretched below,</br>A chequered valley, rich in woods and corn,</br>Where many a hamlet's light was seen to glow</br>At darkening eve; where soft at earliest morn</br>From many a cot the spiry smoke was borne,</br>First mark of man a-stir; a village wide,</br>Where gardens broad the straggling cots adorn,</br>Was near below; shone verdant down beside,</br>Where lowed the milky herd, the hamlet's common pride.", "How sweet at eve, when loom and anvil's sound,</br>That thro' that village day had ceaseless rung,</br>Was hushed; when forth from busiest sheds around,</br>Their tasks performed, the eager tradesmen flung,</br>To drink the breeze of heaven in joyous throng,</br>And pleasure seek in healthful change of toil:</br>Some feed their cherished cows; with hatchet strong</br>Some fuel-store prepare; in softer moil</br>Some prop the blooming pea, and court the genial soil.", "And some, when now those leisure cares are done,</br>Beneath some elm on western slope convene,</br>Where name-carved bench is placed for evening sun,</br>And northern grove protects the quiet scene;</br>There many a rustic theme consumes the e'en,</br>And all of ill or good that peasants feel</br>From laws and wars and kings is heard between;</br>Some tell their wrongs, the cause would some reveal,</br>And some, sagacious more, propound the means to heal.", "And here the Elder too might oft be found,</br>Here loved at eve to list the eager theme,</br>To hear the peasants deal their praises round,</br>Or cast on \"ruling powers\" their whispered blame;</br>Could oft, with word revered, allay the flame</br>Of vexed complaint:  his glance, with anger fired,</br>Could break the young declaimer's airy dream</br>(By lawless books, those whispering toads, inspired)</br>That soars to freedoms wild, of slow experience tired.", "Yet small the charm declaimer's theme can bring</br>(If public wants not pinch the peasant's store,</br>And teach him jealousy) to village ring,</br>That meets to toll the rustic business o'er</br>And themes of home.  Their fond attention more</br>Was won (while yet such kindred theme was given)</br>While Elder scanned th' assembled preachers' lore,</br>Whose rival eloquence had fondly striven</br>To win the hearts of men, and deck the rites of heaven.", "They loved to hear how 'mid some mountain dell</br>Where emerald grass with pearly daisies shone,</br>And blooming furze diffused its fragrant smell,</br>While o'er some neighbouring grove on hillock lone</br>By ancient church the wandering eye was won&mdash;</br>How mingling here with breeze's fading sound,</br>Was heard in cadence mild, like hermit's tone,</br>The preacher's voice; and how innumerous round</br>Delighted hearers sat, in fond attention wound.", "How there that preacher stood, like him of old,</br>Who, 'mid the wilds of Judah's desert plain,</br>To gathering thousands awful warning told</br>Of high Messiah's dread approaching reign;</br>How there, like him he poured his eager strain</br>'Mid lonely dell of far sequestered height,</br>Repentant hearts for christain life to gain,</br>And trembling souls to fit for awful rite,</br>Where Saviour's dying love bursts full on mortal sight.", "When rose their choral hymn's aerial tide,</br>How sweet the mellowed sound apart to hear,</br>Beneath some mountain grove's o'ershadowing side,</br>Like songs of Eden poured on Adam's ear</br>From groves where angels walked; while, listening near,</br>By hillock green, young wedded pair was seen,</br>Who soothed, with fond caress, their infant's tear,</br>Lest childish wail invade the listening scene,</br>And break those sounds of praise where angels heark to men.", "Such theme the peasant loved:  such scene sublime</br>By grandsire's foot he oft had tripped to see,</br>And recollections fond of earliest time,</br>And charms beloved of native scenery,</br>Were mingled there with rites that holiest be;</br>And round the Elder oft, such tale to hear,</br>They eager thronged beneath their village tree;</br>To them than senates' lore that tale more dear,</br>Or all of war and fight that fills the city's ear.", "So passed their eve:  and then would Elder stray</br>To neighb'ring cot, where, lov'd and welcome guest,</br>He whiled in rural tall the hours away:</br>The father's serious tale, the youngster's jest,</br>The damsel's song, the child in frolic blest;</br>Each gay, by turns amused the cheerful sire:</br>The young enjoy their mirth, the old their rest,</br>And all to please their honoured guest conspire,</br>While, mid the jovial ring, gleams bright their bickering fire.", "And might, at times, misfortune's frown severe</br>Such gladsome scene to hopeless sadness turn;</br>Did pinching want extort a murmuring tear,</br>And bid their wearied hearts in silence mourn,</br>Or urge despair in angry words to burn;</br>While stranger's kindness half-degrading seemed,</br>And tore their wounded pride with newer thorn:&mdash;</br>The Elder's step was ne'er intrusive deemed:</br>Familiar oft before, for kindness still esteemed.", "And oft when frightened wealth in vain had tried</br>Each wonted art the peasant vexed to sooth,</br>Had smiled, and glozed, and half-concealed his pride,</br>And mingled promise fair and speeches smooth,</br>Yet met but sullen looks in every booth;</br>The Elder's voice, in all its words sincere,</br>Could lull to peace his brethren's passions wroth;</br>Their sufferings just in patience taught to bear,</br>Or shewed by rightful path to reach their ruler's ear.", "Even she, that maid, around whose youthful breast</br>Consumption's serpent coils were firmly wound,</br>Whose feverish heart each visit now oppressed,</br>While shrunk her startled ear from every sound,</br>The Elder's converse still delightful found;</br>While he, to win her ear, would cheerful tell</br>Of evenings spent her parents' hearth around,</br>Where friend to friend was joined in social spell:</br>Then led her thoughts from earth on bliss supreme to dwell.", "How different he, the haughty pastor, sent</br>Amid this humble flock \"the Word\" to preach!</br>Who ne'er within such humble threshold went,</br>Save (yearly task) some stern advice to teach,</br>Or, called perchance, at death's impending breach:</br>Can dying men of such regard the care,</br>Whose tardy steps with death the port but reach?</br>A signal known, his visit speaks despair,</br>Alarms the feverish heart, and thought bewilders there.", "When reapers keen on harvest fields were met,</br>This wight for many an useful deed was loved:</br>Disjointed limb his ready skill could set,</br>And wound from sickle rough his salve removed,</br>Whene'er the youngster's mirth too freely roved,</br>One little word from him its flight restrained;</br>And maid that, blushing, half that flight approved,</br>Yet blessed his care for purer mirth regained,</br>And youth in freedom met &mdash; thus age preserved unstained.", "At Harvest-home he loved the mirthful feast,</br>Where master's  welcome servants' cares beguiled</br>Where met the youth in mutual kindness blessed,</br>Who late in rival strength had eager toiled:</br>When down the dance the maiden grateful smiled</br>On him whose care her harvest's toil had eased;</br>When rustic mirth flung round in antics wild,</br>And youth rejoiced from yearly toils released,</br>While age sat gladsome near, like guardian angel pleased.", "And much he wont th' ungenerous pride to blame</br>Of masters stern, to mushroom riches grown,</br>Who thus to mix with labour deemed it shame,</br>And gave for wonted feast the sordid boon;</br>'Twixt youth and age the bait for discord sown,</br>That neither pleased, and both with strife defiled;</br>For careful age will hoard the pittance thrown,</br>And youth, of age's decent care despoiled,</br>Will seek unsanctioned mirth, to sinful joys beguiled.", "With bitterest smile the Elder oft would list,</br>When men of wealth, in piteous mood, complained</br>Of peasants now depraved, of virtues ceased,</br>And rural manners old, with vice distained,</br>And schemes of pride where simplest order reigned&mdash;</br>Alas!  themselves the cause!  their pride of shew</br>To mix with lowlier toil has long disdained&mdash;</br>Each jealous rank repels each rank below,</br>Familiar guardian once, a stern inspector now.", "How far the ill descends!  the farmer's hall,</br>Where lived the servants once, beneath the care</br>Of master kind &mdash;
