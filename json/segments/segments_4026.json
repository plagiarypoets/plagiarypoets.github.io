["In a snug rural cot at the foot of yon hill</br>Lives Delia, the toast of each amorous swain;</br>There I've heard, sadly pensive, the clack of a mill,</br>And the soft tinkling streamlet that waters the plain;</br>For the spot seem'd a Heaven where Delia had been;</br>There I sigh'd, and her name have I carv'd on a tree;</br>Yet Delia, so fair, might Horatio disdain,</br>Did she know how he loves, tho' of humble degree.", "What swain could behold so enchanting a face,</br>And not feel, like Horatio, the transports of love!</br>When she trips o'er the lawn with such exquisite grace,</br>And her chantings resound thro' the echoing grove;</br>Then, elated with joy, I bound over the plain</br>With my pipe and my crook, who so happy as me?</br>Yet Delia, so fair, might Horatio disdain,</br>Did she know how he loves, tho' of humble degree.", "In silence, ah!  let me my passion control,</br>If her rank won't admit such affection as mine;</br>So pure, so sublime, it enlarges the soul,</br>And yet I must sigh, must unnotic'd repine.</br>But why should I sigh, and thus fondly complain?</br>She knows not her name was engraven by me;</br>Sure &mdash; Delia could never Horatio disdain,</br>He so ardently loves, tho' of humble degree.</br>"]
