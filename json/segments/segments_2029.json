["Spirit of elder Time!  immortal Song!&mdash;</br>The high and the inspired have told thy worth;</br>Thou shed'st around us, like the night's bright throng,</br>A ray of softness, gracefulness, and mirth:</br>Thou art, and hast been, from thine earliest birth,</br>A charm with Man's affections intertwined:&mdash;</br>A beauty and glory upon earth:&mdash;</br>A power and a creation of the mind,</br>Which is itself divine &mdash; mysterious &mdash; undefined!", "With the young minstrel, in his visioned moods,</br>Thou art a \"visible presence;\" &mdash; thy decree</br>Throngs with majestic forms his solitudes,</br>His feelings &mdash; thoughts &mdash; receive their life from thee:</br>Spirit of Song!  the melancholy sea</br>Gives up its ancient secrets to thy hand;&mdash;</br>Thou speak'st the language of eternity:</br>Histories of long-lost years at thy command</br>Sound on the thousand tongues and echoes of the land!", "Thou sing'st the sweetness of the morn's first  hour,</br>When to the founts her loveliest tints are given;</br>Thou sing'st of love &mdash; in court, in hall, or bower;</br>Of those who with hard fate have nobly striven;</br>Thou sing'st of war &mdash; of helms and corslets riven,</br>Of the dread grandeur of the battle-field;</br>Where flees the foe, by horse and horseman driven,</br>Flash the sharp brands the victors madly wield,</br>Red in the blood of all &mdash; that strive or basely yield.", "Spirit of Verse!  in deepest reverence</br>I bow before thine ever glorious shrine;</br>Thee I have loved with passion most intense;</br>And though I feel thy meeds can ne'er be mine,</br>Yet may I pour one low and gentle line,</br>A breath of song:  I know it to be vain,</br>This cherished wish, a living wreath to twine;</br>'Tis not for me such honour to attain&mdash;</br>Some few may list, perhaps, and not condemn my strain.</br>"]
