["Ah, say not, young Shepherdess, I am to blame,</br>When I tell you the swains are untrue;</br>Nor think that each youth is possess'd of a flame</br>Who swears he's devoted to you.", "The artful Lysander, his love is exprest</br>In accents so winningly sweet,</br>As might tempt the fleet moments delighted to rest</br>Inactive, their pleasure-wing'd feet.", "Gay Damon will tell you, though splendid the sun,</br>'Tis not half so brilliant as you;</br>And thus in a strain of high compliments run,</br>Perhaps not a syllable true.", "Aricius walks stately and proud o'er the plain,</br>In the mirror his image he'll view;</br>But when you appear, even Aricius the vain</br>Enraptur'd kneels captive to you.", "But, dearest Lamira, may you never prove</br>With humiliation this truth:</br>That interest governs their actions, not love,</br>That your gold has more charms than your youth!", "In vain lavish Nature had spread o'er your cheek</br>Those roses unsullied by Art;</br>In vain from your eyes sprightly Genius might speak</br>The thoughts that ennoble your heart&mdash;", "Had not Fortune, indulgent, embellish'd each grace</br>With varnish that never can fade;</br>Whose lustre, when wrinkles shall alter your face,</br>Shall throw a new light o'er the shade.", "Enough of the youths of Arcadia I've told,</br>Nor further intend to advise;</br>Lamira may fancy my censures too bold,</br>But my pen paints the heart, not the eyes.</br>"]
