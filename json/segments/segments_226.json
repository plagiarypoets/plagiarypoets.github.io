Heroic claims a Loftier Strain.</br>In the Narration of some great Design,</br>Invention, Art, and Fable all must joyn:</br>Here Fiction must employ its utmost grace;</br>All must assume a Body, Mind,

Treasure of his mind,</br>The Poet does a thousand Figures find,</br>Around the work his Ornaments he pours,</br>And strows with lavish hand his op'ning Flow'rs.</br>'Tis not a wonder if a Tempest bore</br>The Trojan Fleet against the Libyan Shore;</br>From faithless Fortune this is no surprise,</br>For every day 'tis common to our eyes;</br>But angry Juno, that she might destroy,</br>And overwhelm the rest of ruin'd Troy:</br>That Aeolus with the fierce Goddess joyn'd,</br>Op'ned the hollow Prisons of the Wind;</br>Till angry Neptune, looking o're the Main,</br>Rebukes the Tempest,

aside,</br>Thinking our God, and Prophets that he sent,</br>Might Act like those the Poets did invent,</br>To fright poor Readers in each Line with Hell,</br>And talk of Satan, Ashtaroth, and Bel;</br>The Mysteries which Christians must believe,</br>Disdain such shifting Pageants to receive:</br>The Gospel offers nothing to our thoughts</br>But penitence, or punishment for faults;</br>And mingling falshoods with those Mysteries,</br>Would make our Sacred Truths appear like Lyes.</br>Besides, what pleasure can it be to hear,</br>The howlings of repining Lucifer,</br>Whose rage at your imagin'd Hero flyes,</br>And oft with God himself disputes the prize?</br>Tasso, you'l say, has done it with applause;</br>It is not here I mean to Judge his Cause:</br>Yet, tho our Age has so extoll'd his name,</br>His Works had never gain'd immortal Fame,</br>If holy Godfrey in his Ecstasies</br>Had only Conquer'd Satan on his knees;</br>If Tancred, and Armida's pleasing form,</br>Did not his melancholy Theme adorn.</br>'Tis not, that Christian Poems ought to be</br>Fill'd with the Fictions of Idolatry;</br>But in a common Subject to reject</br>The Gods, and Heathen Ornaments neglect;</br>To banish Tritons who the Seas invade,</br>To take Pan's Whistle, or the Fates degrade,</br>To hinder Charon in his leaky Boat</br>To pass the Shepherd with the Man of Note,</br>Is with vain Scruples to disturb your mind,</br>And search Perfection you can never End:</br>As well they may forbid us to present</br>Prudence or Justice for an Ornament,</br>To paint old Janus with his front of Brass,</br>And take from Time his Scythe, his Wings and Glass,</br>And every where, as't were Idolatry,</br>Banish Descriptions from our Poetry.</br>Leave 'em their pious Follys to pursue;</br>But let our Reason such vain fears subdue:</br>And let us not, amongst our Vanities,</br>Of the true God create a God of Lyes.</br>In Fable we a thousand pleasures see,</br>And the smooth names seem made for Poetry;</br>As Hector, Alexander, Helen, Phillis,</br>Ulysses, Agamemnon, and Achilles:</br>In such a Crowd, the Poet were to blame</br>To chuse King Chilp'eric for his Hero's name.</br>Sometimes, the name being well or ill apply'd,</br>Will the whole Fortune of your Work decide.</br>Would you your Reader never should be tir'd?</br>Choose some great Hero, fit to be admir'd,</br>In Courage signal, and in Virtue bright,</br>Let ev'n his very failings give delight;</br>Let his great Actions our attention bind,</br>Like Caesar, or like Scipio, frame his mind,</br>And not like Oedipus his perjur'd Race;</br>A common Conqueror is a Theme too base.</br>Chuse not your Tale of Accidents too full;</br>Too much variety may make it dull:</br>Achilles rage alone, when wrought with skill,</br>Abundantly does a whole Iliad fill.</br>Be your Narrations lively, short, and smart;</br>In your Descriptions show your noblest Art:</br>There 'tis your Poetry may be employ'd;</br>Yet you must trivial Accidents avoid.</br>Nor imitate that  Fool, who, to describe</br>The wondrous Marches of the Chosen Tribe,</br>Plac'd on the sides, to see their Armyes pass,</br>The Fishes staring through the liquid Glass;</br>Describ'd a Child, who with his little hand,</br>Pick'd up the shining Pebbles from the sand.</br>Such objects are too mean to stay our sight;</br>Allow your Work a just and nobler flight.</br>Be your beginning plain; and take good heed</br>Too soon you mount not on the Airy Steed:</br>Nor tell your Reader, in a Thund'ring Verse,</br>I sing the Conqueror of the  Universe.</br>What can an Author after this produce?</br>The lab'ring Mountain must bring forth a Mouse.</br>Much better are we pleas'd with his Address</br>Who, without making such vast promises,</br>Sayes, in an easier Stile and plainer Sence,</br>\"I Sing the Combats of that pious Prince</br>Who from the Phrygian Coast his Armies

fame,</br>And future glory of the Roman Name;</br>Of Styx and Acheron describe the Floods,</br>And Caesars wandring in th' Elysian Woods:</br>With Figures numberless his Story grace,</br>And every thing in beauteous Colours trace.</br>At once you maybe pleasing, and sublime;</br>I hate a heavy melancholy Rhyme:</br>I'de rather read Orlando's Comic Tale,</br>Than a dull Author always stiff and stale,</br>Who thinks himself dishonour'd in his stile,</br>If on his Works the Graces do but smile.</br>'Tis said, that Homer, Matchless in his Art,</br>Stole Venus Girdle, to ingage the

does their minds ingage,</br>Puff'd with vain pride, presume they understand,</br>And boldly take the trumpet in their hand;</br>Their Fustian Muse each Accident confounds;</br>Nor can she fly, but rise by leaps and bounds,</br>Till their small Rock of Learning quickly spent,</br>Their Poem dyes for want of nourishment:</br>In vain Mankind the hot-brain'd fools decryes,</br>No branding Censures can unveil his eyes;</br>With Impudence the Laurel they invade,</br>Resolv'd to like the Monsters they have made.</br>Virgil, compar'd to them, is flat and dry;</br>And Homer understood not

"The great Success which Tragic Writers found,</br>In Athens first the Comedy renown'd,</br>Th' abusive Grecian there, by pleasing wayes,</br>Dispers'd his natu'ral malice in his Playes:</br>Wisdom, and Virtue, Honor, Wit, and Sence,</br>Were Subject to Buffooning insolence:</br>Poets were publickly approv'd, and sought,</br>That Vice extol'd, and Virtue set at naught;</br>And Socrates himself, in that loose Age,</br>Was made the Pastime of a Scoffing Stage.</br>At last the Public took in hand the Cause,</br>And cur'd this Madness by the pow'r of Laws;</br>Forbad at any time, or any place,</br>To name the Person, or describe the Face.</br>The Stage its ancient Fury thus let fall,</br>And Comedy diverted without Gall:</br>By mild reproofs, recover'd minds diseas'd,</br>And, sparing Persons, innocently pleas'd.</br>Each one was nicely shown in this new Glass,</br>And smil'd to think He was not meant the Ass:</br>A Miser oft would laugh the first, to find</br>A faithful Draught of his own sordid mind,</br>And Fops were with such care and cunning writ,</br>They lik'd the Piece for which themselves did sit.</br>You then, that would the Comic Lawrels wear,</br>To study Nature be your only care:</br>Who e're knows man, and by a curious art</br>Discerns the hidden secrets of the heart;</br>He who observes, and naturally can Paint</br>The Jealous-Fool, the fawning Sycophant,</br>A Sober Wit, an enterprising Ass,</br>A humorous Otter, or a Hudibras;</br>May safely in these noble Lists ingage,</br>And make 'em Act and Speak upon the Stage:</br>Strive to be natural in all you Write,</br>And paint with Colours that may please the Sight.</br>Nature in various Figures does abound;</br>And in each mind are diff'rent Humors found:</br>A glance, a touch, discovers to the wise;</br>But every man has not discerning Eyes.</br>All-changing Time does also change the mind;</br>And diff'rent Ages, diff'rent pleasures find:</br>Youth, hot and furious, cannot brook delay,</br>By flattering Vice is eas'ly led away;</br>Vain in discourse, inconstant in desire,</br>In Censure, rash; in pleasures, all on fire.</br>The Manly age does Readier thoughts enjoy;</br>Pow'r, and Ambition do his Soul employ:</br>Against the turns of Fate he sets his mind;</br>And by the past the future hopes to find.</br>Decrepit Age, still adding to his Stores,</br>For others heaps the Treasure he adores.</br>In all his actions keeps a frozen pace;</br>Past Times extols, the present to debase:</br>Incapable of pleasures Youth abuse,</br>In others blames, what age does him refuse.</br>Your Actors must by Reason be control'd;</br>Let young men speak like young, old men like old:</br>Observe the Town, and study well the Court,</br>For thither various Characters resort:</br>Thus 'twas great Johnson purchas'd his renown,</br>And in his Art had born away the Crown;</br>If less desirous of the Peoples praise,</br>He had not with low Farce debas'd his

please,</br>And your Intrigue unravel'd be with ease:</br>Your Action still should Reason's Rules obey,</br>Nor in an empty Scene may lose its way.</br>Your humble Stile must sometimes gently rise;</br>And your Discourse Sententious be, and Wise:</br>The Passions must to Nature be confin'd,</br>And Scenes to Scenes with Artful weaving joyn'd:</br>Your Wit must not unseasonably play;</br>But follow Bus'ness, never lead the way.</br>Observe how Terence does this error shun;</br>A careful Father chides his Am'orous Son:</br>Then see, that Son, whom no advice can move,</br>Forget those Orders, and pursue his Love:</br>'Tis not a well-drawn Picture we discover;</br>'Tis a true son, a Father, and a Lover,</br>I like an Author that Reforms the Age,</br>And keeps the right Decorum of the Stage,</br>That alwayes pleases by just Reason's Rule:</br>But for a tedious Droll, a Quibling Fool,</br>Who with low nauseous Baudry fills his Plays;</br>Let  him begon and

Malignant Fevers, burn.</br>Hated, at last, his Practice gives him o'er:</br>One Friend, unkill'd by Drugs, of all his Store,</br>In his new Country-house affords him peace,</br>'Twas a rich Abbot, and a Building Ass:</br>Here first the Doctor's Talent came in play,</br>He seems Inspir'd, and talks like Wren or May:</br>Of this new Portico condemns the Face,</br>And turns the Entrance to a better place;</br>Designs the Stair-case at the other end.</br>His Friend approves, does for his Mason send,</br>He comes; the Doctor's Arguments prevail.</br>In short, to finish this our hum'rous
