oft-times bent to lascivious sport,</br>And comming where Endimion did resort,</br>Hath courted him, inflamed with desire,</br>Thinking some Nymph was cloth'd in boyes attire.</br>And often-times the

convart,</br>To an internall passion of the hart,</br>By motion of that sodaine joy or feare,</br>Which we receive either by the eye or eare,</br>For by retraction of the spirit and blood,</br>From those exterior parts where first they stood,</br>Into the center of the body sent,</br>Returnes againe more strong and vehement:</br>And in the like extreamitie made cold,</br>About the same,

it selfe agayne,</br>To pitty him by her unkindnes slayne.", "She, as it seemd, who all this time attended,</br>Longing to heare that once his tale were ended,</br>Now like a jealous woman she repeats,</br>Mens subtilties, and naturall deceyts;</br>And by example strives to verifie,</br>Their ficklenes and vaine inconstancie:</br>Their hard obdurate harts, and wilfull blindnes,</br>Telling a storie wholy of unkindnes;</br>But he, who well perceived her intent,</br>And to remove her from this argument,</br>Now by the sacred Fount he vowes and sweares,</br>By Lovers sighes, and by her halowed teares,</br>By holy Latmus now he takes his oath,</br>That all he spake was in good fayth and troth;</br>And for no frayle uncertayne doubt should move her,</br>Vowes secrecie, the crown of a true Lover.", "She hearing this, thought time that she reveald,</br>That kind affection which she long conceald,</br>Determineth to make her true Love known,</br>Which shee had borne unto Endimion;</br>I am no Huntresse, nor no Nymph (quoth she)</br>As thou perhaps imagin'st me to be,</br>I am great Phoebe, Latmus sacred Queene,</br>Who from the skies have hether past unseene,</br>And by thy chast love hether was I led,</br>Where full three yeares thy fayre flock have I fed,</br>Upon these Mountaines and these firtile plaines,</br>And crownd thee King of all the Sheepheards swaines:</br>Nor wanton, nor lacivious is my love,</br>Nor never lust my chast thoughts once could move;</br>But sith thou thus hast offerd at my Shrine,</br>And of the Gods hast held me most divine,</br>Mine Altars thou with sacrifice hast stord,</br>And in my Temples hast my name ador'd,</br>And of all other, most hast honor'd mee,</br>Great Phoebes glory thou alone shalt see.", "Thys spake, she putteth on her brave attire,</br>As being burnisht in her Brothers fire,</br>Purer then that Celestiall shining flame</br>Wherein great Jove unto his Lemmon came,</br>Which quickly had his pale cheekes over-spred,</br>And tincted with a lovely blushing red.</br>Which whilst her Brother Titan for a space,</br>Withdrew himselfe, to give his sister place,</br>Shee now is darkned to all creatures eyes,</br>Whilst in the shadow of the earth she lyes,</br>For that the earth of nature cold and dry,</br>A very Chaos of obscurity,</br>Whose Globe exceeds her compasse by degrees,</br>Fixed upon her Superficies;</br>When in his shadow she doth hap to fall,</br>Dooth cause her darknes to be generall.", "Thus whilst he layd his head upon her lap,</br>Shee in a fiery Mantle doth him wrap,</br>And carries him up from this lumpish mould,</br>Into the skyes, whereas he might behold,</br>The earth in perfect roundnes of a ball</br>Exceeding globes most artificiall:</br>Which in a fixed poynt Nature disposed,</br>And with the sundry Elements inclosed,</br>Which as the Center permanent dooth stay,</br>When as the skies in their diurnall sway,</br>Strongly maintaine the ever-turning course,</br>Forced alone by their first moover sourse,</br>Where he beholds the ayery Regions,</br>Whereas the clouds and strange impressions,</br>Maintaynd by coldnes often doe appeare,</br>And by the highest Region of the ayre,</br>Unto the cleerest Element of fire,</br>Which to her silver foot-stoole doth aspire,</br>Then dooth she mount him up into her Sphere,</br>Imparting heavenly secrets to him there,</br>Where lightned by her shining beames hee sees,</br>The powerfull Plannets, all in their degrees,</br>Their sundry revolutions in the skies,</br>And by their working how they simpathize;</br>All in theyr circles severally prefixt,</br>And in due distance each with other mixt:</br>The mantions which they hold in their estate,</br>Of which by nature they participate;</br>And how those signes their severall places take,</br>Within the compasse of the Zodiacke:</br>And in their severall triplicities consent,</br>Unto the nature of an Element,</br>To which the Plannets do themselves disperce,</br>Having the guidance of this univers,</br>And do from thence extend their severall powers,</br>Unto this little fleshly world of ours:</br>Wherin her Makers workmanship is found,</br>As in contriving of this mighty round,</br>In such strange maner and such fashion wrought,</br>As doth exceede mans dull and feeble

fire and ayre participate,</br>And some of watry and of earthy state,</br>As hote and moyst, with chilly cold and dry,</br>And unto these the other contrary;</br>And by their influence powerfull on the earth,</br>Predominant in mans fraile mortall bearth,</br>And that our lives effects and fortunes are,</br>As is that happy or unlucky Starre,</br>Which reigning in our frayle nativitie,</br>Seales up the secrets of our destinie,</br>With frendly Plannets in conjunction set,</br>Or els with other meerely opposet:</br>And now to him her greatest power she lent,</br>To lift him to the starry Firmament,</br>Where he beheld that milky stayned place,</br>By which the Twynns and heavenly Archers trace,</br>The dogge which doth the furious Lyon beate,</br>Whose flaming breath increaseth Titans heate,</br>The teare-distilling mournfull Pliades,</br>Which on the earth the stormes and tempests raise,</br>And all the course the constellations run,</br>When in conjunction with the Moone or Sun,</br>When towards the fixed Articke they arise,</br>When towards the Antaricke, falling from our eyes;</br>And having impt the wings of his desire,</br>And kindled him, with this coelestiall fire,</br>She sets him downe, and vanishing his sight,</br>Leaves him inwrapped in this true delight:</br>Now wheresoever he his fayre flock fed,</br>The Muses still Endimion followed;</br>His sheepe as white as Swans or driven snow,</br>Which beautified the soyle with such a show,</br>As where hee folded in the darkest Night,</br>There never needed any other light;</br>If that he hungred and desired meate,</br>The Bees would bring him Honny for to eate,</br>Yet from his lyps would not depart away,</br>Tyll they were loden with Ambrosia;</br>And if he thirsted, often there was seene</br>A bubling Fountaine spring out of the greene,</br>With Christall liquor fild unto the brim,</br>Which did present her liquid store to him.</br>If hee would hunt, the fayre Nymphs at his will,</br>With Bowes and Quivers, would attend him still:</br>And what-soever he desierd to have,</br>That he obtain'd if hee the same would crave.", "And now at length, the joyful tyme drew

Theologicall:</br>And first composing of this number nine,</br>Which of all numbers is the most divine,</br>From orders of the Angels dooth arise,</br>Which be contayned in three Hirarchies,</br>And each of these three Hirarchies in three,</br>The perfect forme of true triplicity;</br>And of the Hirarchies I spake of erst,</br>The glorious Epiphania is the first,</br>In which the hie celestiall orders been,</br>Of Thrones, Chirrup, and the Ciraphin;</br>The second holds the mighty Principates,</br>The Dominations and the Potestates,</br>The Ephionia, the third Hirarchie,</br>Which Vertues Angels and Archangels be;</br>And thus by threes we aptly do define,</br>And do compose this sacred number nyne,</br>Yet each of these nyne orders grounded be,</br>Upon some one particularity,</br>Then as a Poet I might so infer,</br>An other order when I spake of her.</br>From these the Muses onely are derived,</br>Which of the Angels were in nyne contrived;</br>These heaven-inspired Babes of memorie,</br>Which by a like attracting Sympathy,</br>Apollos Prophets in theyr furies wrought,</br>And in theyr spirit inchaunting numbers taught,</br>To teach such as at Poesie repine,</br>That it is onely heavenly and divine,</br>And manifest her intellectual parts,</br>Sucking the purest of the purest Arts;</br>And unto these as by a sweet consent,</br>The Sphery circles are equivalent,</br>From the first Moover, and the starry heaven,</br>To glorious Phoebe lowest of the seaven,</br>Which Jove in tunefull Diapazons fram'd,</br>Of heavenly Musick of the Muses nam'd,</br>To which the soule in her divinitie,</br>By her Creator made of harmony,</br>Whilst she in frayle and mortall flesh dooth live,</br>To her nyne sundry offices doe give,</br>Which offices united are in three,</br>Which like the orders of the Angels be,</br>Prefiguring thus by the number nyne,</br>The soule, like to the Angels is divine:</br>And from these nines those Conquerers renowned,</br>Which with the wreaths of triumph oft were crowned.</br>Which by their vertues gain'd the worthies name</br>First had this number added to their fame,</br>Not that the worthiest men were onely nine,</br>But that the number of it selfe divine,</br>And as a perfect patterne of the rest,</br>Which by this holy number are exprest;</br>Nor Chivalrie this title onely gaynd;</br>But might as well by wisedome be obtaynd,</br>Nor in this number men alone included,</br>But unto women well might be aluded,</br>Could wit, could worlds, coulde times, could ages find,</br>This number of Elizas

by a heaven-inspired prophecy,</br>Divinest Poets first derived these,</br>The fayrest Graces Jove-borne Charites;</br>And in this number Musick first began,</br>The Lydian, Dorian, and the Phrigian,</br>Which ravishing in their soule-pleasing vaine,</br>They made up seaven in a higher strayne;</br>And all those signes which Phoebus doth ascend,</br>Before he bring his yearely course to end,</br>Their several natures mutually agree,</br>And doe concurre in thys triplicitie;</br>And those interior sences with the rest,</br>Which properly pertaine to man and Beast,</br>Nature herselfe
