["Last Midsummer morn, as I stray'd thro' the grove,</br>Young Dolly I met by the way;</br>I told her her charms had subdu'd me with love,</br>And caus'd her awhile for to stray.", "Silly Damon, she cried, what would you be at?</br>Your fooling give over, I pray;</br>For all your fond wooing, your cooing, and chat,</br>No longer shall make me delay.", "Then I press'd her hand close, saying, can you deny</br>A favour so striking as this?</br>But still she rejected, and cried out, oh fie!</br>When I eagerly stole a sweet kiss.", "With rapture I gaz'd on her delicate charms,</br>(For I could not resist it, I vow;)</br>Then clasping her lovingly in my fond arms,</br>Said she, I must go to my cow.", "Then away o'er the plain together we went</br>'Till come to a cool river side;</br>Where we tarried awhile, 'till I gain'd her consent,</br>For ever to be my true bride.", "Adieu!  then, ye trouble, and plagues of this life,</br>With Dolly I sure shall be blest;</br>For when that kind Providence makes her my wife,</br>We'll lull all our cares into rest.</br>"]
