["Thy hills, thy pastures Mirfield, and the shade</br>Of Kirklee's pendant woods, and Calder's stream,</br>Pride of the sinuous vale!</br>Shall in remembrance live,", "While yet the breeze that fans the whispering grove,</br>The sun's warm radiance, and the softer gleam</br>Of the moon's pensive orb</br>Can soothe the Poet's soul.", "Yet not thy hills, thy pastures, and thy groves</br>Of pendant shade, or Calder's sinuous stream,</br>With sunny radiance bright,</br>Or the moon's pensive beam,", "Tho' sweet to sense, the genuine rapture wakes.</br>No &mdash; dearer far, the cordial Muse reveres</br>The hospitable roof,</br>And Pilling's social name.</br>"]
