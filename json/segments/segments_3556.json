["Hail, ancient Pile!  within whose Moss-grown Cells</br>Erst the pale Virgins spent the Midnight Hours;</br>Mistaken Zeal! &mdash; With Grief my Bosom swells,</br>That to the Lamp should droop such op'ning Flowers,</br>Form'd of Man's Heart to make the purest Joy,</br>And prove God's great Behest &mdash; \"increase and multiply.\"", "Again all hail! &mdash; that Nature now resumes</br>Her genial Reign! &mdash; Monastic Vice no more</br>Pollutes these vainly-consecrated Rooms:&mdash;</br>But o'er yon ivy'd Walls the Night Birds soar;</br>And the pale Moon supplies the Taper's Light,</br>Nor Sighs, nor sorrowing Chants, disturb the peaceful Night.", "Thy tyrant Arm, capricious Henry!  drew</br>The pamper'd Votaries from these Bigot Scenes;</br>In lucky Rage, their mystick Shrines o'erthrew,</br>And to thy Crown annex'd their rich Demesnes.</br>Thro' the wide Portals rush'd the Virgin Train,</br>And here, Despair no more sustains her black Domain.", "So in old Times, fast in a brazen Tower</br>Immers'd beneath the baleful Yew-Trees' Shade,</br>Victim to Spells, and fascinating Power,</br>To Guilt averse, lay some enchanted Maid;</br>'Till her brave Knight to Love and Virtue true,</br>Redeem'd his long-lost Prize and the fell Paynim slew.", "But crush not, Time, with thy all withering Hand</br>These verdant Relicts yet for Ages hence;</br>Let them in British Art unrival'd stand,</br>A Monument of sculptur'd Excellence;</br>To them, e'en Attick Elegance shall bow,</br>And all the boasted Fanes, Ilyssus!  on thy Brow.", "Should to these Shades some faithful Lovers stray</br>By Love's best Food, indulgent Silence, led;</br>Haply, some Virgins 'wailing Ghost may say,</br>\"Fly hence, 'tis Slavery's Seat, Religion's dread,</br>With Rapture pluck the Fruit God's Hand hath given</br>That Path's alone the surest and the best to Heav'n.\"</br>"]
