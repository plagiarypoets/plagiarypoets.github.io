["How idle, how weak are thy strains,</br>Repeated so oft in the grove,</br>Describing the pleasures and pains,</br>That constantly wait upon Love.", "When forc'd from my Maria to go,</br>The maid to my bosom I press;</br>No language can utter my woe,</br>No melody speak my distress.", "But when I am charm'd with the sight,</br>When blest by the voice of my fair;</br>Ye shepherds, your notes of delight,</br>My bliss makes the notes of despair.</br>"]
