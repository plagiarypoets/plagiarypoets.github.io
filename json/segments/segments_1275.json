["For me &mdash; what various tasks demand my care!</br>What pleasing toil, what sweet solicitude!</br>Each tender plant requires its separate share,</br>For while the labourer sleeps, the soil grows rude:</br>More shade or genial warmth must be supplied,</br>More foresight lent to guard, more gentleness to guide.", "More firm resolve to check the wild desire,</br>More skill to guide it to its proper end;</br>When modest merit wishes to retire,</br>More prudent warmth to flatter and commend;</br>More self-command, more watchings, broken sleep,</br>More care for worldly things, yet seem to hold them cheap.", "Dear, lovely babes, that bring this weight of care,</br>Sweet cares!  that bind ye closer to my heart,</br>A heart more proud your filial loves to share</br>Than all that ease and affluence could impart,</br>O meekly bend to my indulgent reign,</br>Which asks no tyrant's nod, no mind-subduing chain.</br>"]
