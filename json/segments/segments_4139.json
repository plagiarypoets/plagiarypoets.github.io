["It is the doom of those who love, and make</br>Their love a theme for song, to have it heard</br>By every ear but her's for whom they wake,</br>And warble, thus, in the night hour of sadness;</br>To know their raptures many a breast have stirr'd,</br>Into like paroxysms of doting madness,</br>And yet could shake not with one softening thrill,</br>The only bosom they had hopes to fill,</br>With such fond phrenzy; 'tis their grief and shame,</br>Still to strike any mark &mdash; save that at which they aim.</br>"]
