["'Tis sweet in manhood's prime to feel the glow</br>Of youthful joy revisiting the heart:</br>Sweet as when o'er the dreary landscape blow</br>Spring's first warm gales, and milder sunbeams dart</br>Their smiles in Nature's face, &mdash; and, with a start</br>Beauty and fragrance wake, as from a trance.</br>Surely that joy will never quite depart;</br>I feel its warmth, unchill'd by life's advance,</br>Whene'er my early haunts meet my delighted glance.", "Oh!  can I ne'er forget those sunny hours,</br>When, glad of heart, along thy banks I stray'd,</br>Dear native Stream, and pluck'd the springing flowers</br>That grew thereon, and childhood's gambols play'd;</br>Ere yet, with ruthless hand, stern Care had laid</br>His yoke upon me, and his rugged lore,</br>In many an arduous lesson had display'd;</br>Yea, still, in memory's fondly cherish'd store,</br>Those happy hours shall live till memory be no more!", "And to my eye, 'mid recollections sweet,</br>Through fairy-regions still thou seem'st to stray;</br>The same fresh verdure still invites my feet</br>To wander, and I hear from every spray</br>The same glad notes from woodland songsters gay:</br>And that awakening sense of bliss long fled,</br>Pervades my bosom with resistless sway,</br>While, musing on the past, once more I tread</br>Thy peaceful borders green, by pensive Fancy led.", "It seems to me as if Time's mighty wing,</br>That sweeps great empires from their base, o'er thee</br>Had pass'd, as o'er some blest and holy thing</br>Not subject to its power; for, still I see,</br>Just as when life's bright morning smiled on me,</br>In the same quiet course thou rollest on:&mdash;</br>Yet, in thy wanderings, what diversity,</br>What varying aspects hast thou undergone!</br>Nor varied less hath been my fate though more unknown.", "I've gaz'd upon thee with delight, when smooth</br>And glistening in the beams of spring's bright reign,</br>With murmuring sound that troubled breasts might soothe,</br>Thou sought'st through meadows fair, the distant main:</br>E'en so in youth, from sorrow free, and pain,</br>My days flow'd on in laughing Joy's career,</br>While Fancy, with her gay, fantastic train,</br>Attending, bade on every hand appear</br>Those visions which through life Remembrance holds so dear.", "But not alone from buoyant health and youth</br>Sprung all the transports that then thrill'd my breast;</br>For on my mind, e'en then had heavenly Truth</br>That deeper sense of happiness imprest</br>Which makes the humblest lot supremely blest:</br>This op'd the source from whence sad Sorrow drew,</br>In after life, when many troubles prest,</br>Rich healing balm.  Her cheering influence too</br>Enchanting POESY o'er each fair prospect threw.", "The charm of song upon my spirit's gladness</br>With wondrous  power in that gay season fell,</br>Blending with joy a shade of pleasing sadness,</br>And calling up, as by some wizard spell,</br>Bright dreams of which I strove in vain to tell;</br>Each vivid image glow'd, and past away.</br>But with still more delight my mind would dwell</br>On brighter glories, which Truth's steady ray</br>Reveal'd &mdash; the realms of rest, and peace, and endless day.", "I've seen thy waters with a torrent's force</br>Resistless, and with loud and rushing sound,</br>Dash forward in their wild impetuous course,</br>As if they scorn'd thy channel's narrow bound;</br>While Winter on the naked landscape frown'd</br>In sullen majesty, and with a blast</br>Terrific, call'd his gathering storms around:</br>Black Ruin follow'd quick where'er they pass'd,</br>And o'er Creation's face thick gloom and horror cast.", "And cheerless was the scene, and dark the hour:&mdash;</br>So, once, my fate, all desolate and drear,</br>And overwhelm'd by fell Affliction's power,</br>Seem'd stript of all that made existence dear,</br>And prompted many a sigh and bitter tear:</br>But as returning Summer's gladdening beam</br>Appeas'd thy waves, so Time, in his career,</br>Still made receding grief and trial seem</br>But as the fading race of some distressful dream.", "We feel a joy surpassing that which springs</br>From present pleasure, when the pensive mind,</br>Silently musing on departed things,</br>To soft reflection's influence is resign'd;</br>For Fancy, then, with Memory's power hath join'd</br>Her witching art; and on past Sorrow's brow</br>With fairy-hands a roseate wreath they bind;&mdash;</br>While as they rise, remember'd scenes of woe,</br>Stript of their former gloom, in tender beauty glow.", "In all the countless throngs of former days,</br>Whose feet have prest thy banks, hath there appear'd</br>No Son of Song thy lapse obscure to praise:</br>Because, forsooth, no cataract was heard</br>Roaring amid thy course &mdash; no mountain rear'd</br>Its hoary crest above thee to the skies:</br>Because, forsooth, the world's contempt they fear'd,</br>Which might thy little Naiad's charms despise,</br>And view these meads and groves with undelighted eyes?", "Yes, there was One, albeit, who breath'd thy name</br>In tuneful verse; for thou were not unknown</br>To him, whom Genius and poetic fame</br>In vain conspir'd to bless; &mdash; whose \"frantic moan,\"</br>More thrilling than the wild and tender tone</br>Of his own lyre, arose upon the wind</br>That swept thy marge, when, pensive and alone,</br>Amid these scenes, his worn and clouded mind</br>Gaz'd anxiously around, some resting-place to find.", "He sought the abode of Peace: &mdash; but Genius gave</br>No light to guide the wanderer on his way:</br>Fame stood aloof, &mdash; was silent, and look'd grave;</br>And Fancy's flights but led him more astray;</br>E'en Learning shone but with a feeble ray,</br>And tardy Fortune could afford no aid:</br>At length, fair Truth, resplendent as the day,</br>Before his eyes the \"best of books\" display'd</br>And sunshine cheer'd his path e'en through Death's fearful shade.", "Child of Misfortune!  whose'er thou art,</br>That, lingering near, his sculptur'd form mayst see</br>Within yon sacred Pile; ere thou depart,</br>E'en though the Muse may not be dear to thee,</br>Shed o'er his grave the tear of sympathy;&mdash;</br>And may that peace which bless'd his life's decline,</br>(From all his woes and bitter anguish free,)</br>His hopes, his holy confidence be thine;</br>Affliction then may frown, &mdash; but thou wilt not repine.", "Thy beauties, humble as they are, fair Stream,</br>Are dear to me, and lovely in mine eyes;</br>And, had I skill to manage well the theme,</br>Might lead my timid Muse to enterprise;</br>But she, as oft as difficulties rise</br>To check her ardour, from th' unfinish'd strain</br>In conscious weakness and dejection flies;</br>But, re-assur'd, as oft returns again,</br>Reluctant to forego the pleasure with the pain.", "And still in silent loneliness my mind,</br>E'en while my hands stern Labour's shackles wear,</br>In POESY a solace sweet shall find,&mdash;</br>An ample recompense for toil and care:</br>And hither oft at eve will I repair,</br>And while I muse, or frame some simple lay,</br>(Which like thy murmurs, Lavant, few shall hear,)</br>Calm Meditation by my side shall stray,</br>And Peace, as is her wont attend my lonely way.", "Now sinks to glorious rest th' all cheering sun,</br>Surrounded by a gorgeous cloudy train;</br>While, 'mid a silent host of shadows dun,</br>Twilight begins her mild, but transient reign;</br>But through obscurity involves the plain,</br>The light of day still gilds yon stately spire:</br>So shines the mind which Faith and Hope sustain,</br>Fair, far above earth's scenes, and low desire,</br>Illumin'd by a spark of pure ethereal fire.", "Soft as the dews the deepening shades descend,</br>And spread a solemn, sacred calm around,</br>Till night's broad wings o'er all the scene extend.</br>Nought breaks the stillness save the gentle sound</br>Of rippling waves, that glimmer as they bound</br>On their dark way.  Who would not wish to dwell</br>For ever where such tranquil joys are found?</br>But Duty speaks in yonder curfew bell,</br>And warns me to depart &mdash; blest scenes awhile farewell!</br>"]
