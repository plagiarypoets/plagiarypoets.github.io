["Who shall awake with magic song</br>The wildly-throbbing soul?</br>Who dart the Muse's light along,</br>And bid her thunders roll?</br>Or who with strain of gentlest note</br>In low and liquid warblings float,</br>Soft stealing thro' the silent air,</br>While PITY breathes her mildest lay,</br>And from her eye's Aprilian ray,</br>Slow drops a quivering tear?", "Rude MADNESS, idiot King of Power,</br>Who from the Muse's breast</br>Tore him that in her sacred bower</br>She knew and lov'd the best;</br>Stare not in gloomy silence more,</br>Rage all thy storms of passion o'er,</br>And weave the wildrings of the soul:</br>Pale COLLINS dropt his sacred lyre;</br>He saw thy frenzied orbs of fire,</br>Thy meteor eyeballs roll!", "SUBLIMITY'S enraptur'd child,</br>Say, whither art thou fled?</br>Gone to awake with music wild</br>The slumbers of the dead?</br>Or dost thou still, O tearful Bard,</br>Lorn MELANCHOLY'S wand'rings guard</br>In some remote and solemn grove;</br>With dewy garlands deck the grave,</br>Where FREEDOM lulls her hapless brave,</br>Or dress the tomb of Love?", "Lorn tearful Bard, whose wild-wove lay</br>Each thrilling Passion sung;</br>When Music now soft died away,</br>Now wild and warlike rung;</br>I see, I see thy solemn shade</br>Quick starting from yon haunted glade</br>With tresses tost, and eyes that weep;</br>High o'er the gulf screams danger loud,</br>And FEAR on phantoms wrapt in cloud</br>Howls dreadfully and deep!", "Fell ANGER with his clenching hand</br>Rude dashes on the lyre;</br>Wild throws it on the trembling land,</br>And grasps his torch of fire!</br>Look, look no more &mdash; In murm'ring low</br>I hear the sigh of anguish flow!</br>Sad JEALOUSY, away: &mdash; 'tis thine!</br>Thy hollow smile and fitful sob</br>Too wildly bid my bosom throb;</br>I do not call thee mine!&mdash;", "Hark!  'Tis REVENGE, while thunders peal,</br>With blast of threat'ning breath,</br>Calls on the fiends that darkling deal</br>The hidden point of Death!</br>Fierce as he winds the stormy strain,</br>Rise visages that writhe with pain,</br>And hands the purple steel that grasp;</br>At each dread pause wild groans DESPAIR,</br>And dying PITY on the air</br>Slow heaves a ling'ring gasp!", "But sounds arise more soft and sweet,</br>Melodiously forlorn;</br>They breathe thro' yonder green retreat</br>From MELANCHOLY'S horn!</br>Ye glades, repeat the soothing sound&mdash;</br>Ye runnets, steal in warblings round.</br>From yonder gloom bright visions break!</br>See, HOPE her golden tresses wave,</br>And JOY, whose songs contentment gave,</br>The smiling Morn awake!", "Soul-soothing Bard, in what bright sphere</br>Now breathes thy sacred Lyre?</br>What Angel-youths enraptur'd hear;</br>What heavenly Themes inspire?</br>Thy hand no more sublimely flings</br>Empassion'd Horror on its strings&mdash;</br>Deep and majestically wild;</br>Peace breathes thro' every softer Lay,</br>And INSPIRATION'S gentlest ray</br>Plays round his warbling Child!", "Farewel, sweet Bard &mdash; thy grave around</br>Shall still with flow'rs be dress'd,</br>While SYMPATHY and LOVE be found,</br>To warm the human breast!</br>There TRUTH and FRIENDSHIP, hand in hand,</br>Shall dew with tears the blooming land,</br>And scatter wreaths of ev'ry hue!</br>Still, as she goes, the Muse would stay,</br>Still seems to hear thy thrilling lay,</br>And weeps a last adieu!</br>"]
