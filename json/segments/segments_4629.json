["Ah, Damon, dear shepherd, adieu!</br>By love and first nature allied,</br>Together in fondness we grew;</br>Ah, would we together had died!</br>For thy faith which resembled my own,</br>For thy soul which was spotless and true,</br>For the joys we together have known,</br>Ah, Damon, dear shepherd, adieu!", "What bliss can hereafter be mine!</br>Whomever engaging I see,</br>To his friendship I ne'er can incline,</br>For fear I should mourn him, like thee.</br>Tho' the Muses should crown me with art,</br>Tho' honour and fortune should join;</br>Since thou art denied to my heart,</br>What bliss can hereafter be mine?", "Ah, Damon, dear shepherd, farewell!</br>Thy grave with sad offers I'll bind;</br>Tho' no more in one cottage we dwell,</br>I can keep thee for ever in mind:</br>Each morning I'll visit alone,</br>His ashes who lov'd me so well,</br>And murmur each eve o'er his stone,</br>\"Ah, Damon, dear shepherd, farewell!\"</br>"]
