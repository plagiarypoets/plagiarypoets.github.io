["Sweet Spring returning twines the annual wreath,</br>Breathes the soft zephyr and unfolds the flower,</br>And nature wakes again</br>The choral voice of joy.", "The meadow smiles in renovated green,</br>The blooming orchard sheds its rich perfume,</br>And bursting buds renew</br>The honours of the grove.", "The garden now, where art and nature join</br>Simplicity, and elegance, and taste,</br>The province of the fair,</br>Invites the culturing hand.", "But most Spring charms where nature reigns alone</br>In woody wilds, or on the mountain's side,</br>Where crimson columbines</br>And purple violets blow.", "Now sinks the sun beyond the western hills,</br>His setting glory tinging all the clouds</br>With rich and varying hues,</br>That mock the pencil's power.", "Sweet are the charms of Spring, but doubly sweet</br>When lingering twilight steals upon the day;</br>When the mild star of eve</br>Glows in the blue serene.", "While falling dews refresh each drooping flower,</br>And fragrance mingles with the gentle breeze,</br>Calm Meditation hails</br>Her still and chosen hour.", "She views in blooming nature, nature's GOD,</br>And, while his bounties meet each raptur'd sense,</br>She joins her voice in praise</br>With angels round his throne.</br>"]
