["Stay thy forebodings, busy, busy mind,</br>Why need thou feel the bitter blasts that blow?</br>Why need thou shudder at the Winter's wind,</br>The petryfying frost or driving snow?", "Do not for THEE reviving embers glow?</br>Is not for THEE the social table spread?</br>Does not for THEE the horn of plenty flow?</br>Thou art no beggar of thy daily bread!&mdash;", "Yet thou sitt'st trembling o'er thy brooding thoughts,</br>As if thou wert unshelter'd and forlorn&mdash;</br>Shudd'ring at scenes of woe, all fancy wrought&mdash;</br>\"Some shiv'ring soul to luckless fortune born,</br>From weeping wife and famish'd children torn,</br>Wilder'd and lost in trackless depths of snow!\"</br>At such self-painted prospects must thou mourn!</br>Must the sigh heave, and tears of sorrow flow!", "It is perhaps full human so to do!</br>For what were life if pity took her flight;</br>It is full well to weep for others woe,</br>Yet, let thy faith persuade thee \"all is right.\"", "The wretch that sinks, may rise from his dark night</br>To scenes of brighter bliss that shall not cease,</br>Meet his lov'd friends in realms of endless light</br>Perpetual sunshine and perpetual peace.</br>"]
