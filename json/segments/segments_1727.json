["Lingering I gazed upon that ghastly crowd,</br>And there behold what I can scarce relate,</br>Upon my sole avouch, without a cloud</br>Of witness behind: &mdash; my steady mate</br>Unshrinking Conscience, under whose breast-plate</br>Of truth, and sentiment serene and pure,</br>A man may stand, and freely face his fate&mdash;</br>She urges me to tell all out &mdash; secure</br>Of the event, as one who of his facts is sure.", "Certain I saw, and still, methinks, I view</br>A body moving on without a head,</br>As moved the others of that wretched crew&mdash;</br>The hand that head held firmly, &mdash; and instead</br>Of lamp or lantern, the blind feet it led</br>Grasped by the locks: &mdash; it glared on us, and \"woe,\"</br>It cried, \"woe, woe,\" &mdash; as on the spectre sped&mdash;</br>So here were two in one, and one in two,</br>By what mysterious link, who linked alone can know.", "Soon as the shape right at the bridge's base</br>Stood fixed, the arm was stretched to its height,</br>Raising close up to me this grisly face,</br>That not a word might 'scape me &mdash; \"Here's a sight</br>Of horror for thee, whate'er living wight</br>Thou art, who visitest these seats of pain:&mdash;</br>Hast met with damned ghost in such a plight</br>As this? &mdash; But wouldst thou give to earth again</br>My name and story, (thus the phantom spoke me plain,)", "\"Know that my name is Bertrand, he of Born,</br>Who to King John gave counsels of such guilt,</br>That son 'gainst father raised rebellion's horn&mdash;</br>Not worse Achitophel, who hilt to hilt</br>Set Absolom and David in foul tilt:</br>And thus, by retribution stern, but just,</br>As I the bond of nature's junction spilt</br>Dissevering hearts that rest on sacred trust,</br>So is this plotting head dissevered from its bust.\"</br>"]
