["With all your wings, ye moments, fly,</br>And drive the tardy sun along;</br>Till that glad morn shall paint the sky,</br>Which wakes the muse, and claims the raptur'd song.", "See nature with our wishes join,</br>To aid the dear, the blest design;</br>See Time precipitate his way,</br>To bring th' expected happy day;</br>See, the wish'd-for dawn appears,</br>A more than wonted glow she wears:</br>Hark!  Hymeneals sound;</br>Each muse awakes her softest lyre;</br>Each airy warbler swells the choir;</br>'Tis music all around.", "Awake, ye nymphs, the blushing bride,</br>T' eclipse Aurora's rosy pride;</br>While virgin shame retards her way,</br>And Love, half-angry, chides her stay:</br>While hopes and fears alternate reign,</br>Intermingling bliss and pain;</br>O'er all her charms diffuse peculiar grace,</br>Pant in her shiv'ring heart, and vary in her face.", "At length consent, reluctant fair,</br>To bless thy long-expecting lover's eyes!</br>Too long his sighs are lost in air,</br>At length resign the bliss for which he dies:</br>The muses, prescient of your future joys,</br>Dilate my soul, and prompt the chearful lay;</br>While they, thro' coming times, with glad surprize,</br>The long successive brightning scenes survey.", "Lo!  to your sight a blooming offspring rise,</br>And add new ardour to the nuptial ties;</br>While in each form you both united shine;</br>Fresh honours wait your temples to adorn:</br>For you glad CERES fills the slowing horn,</br>And heav'n and fate to bless your days combine.", "While life gives pleasure, life shall still remain,</br>Till Death, with gentle hand, shall shut the pleasing scene:</br>Safe, sable guide to that celestial shore,</br>Where pleasure knows no end, and change is fear'd no more!</br>"]
