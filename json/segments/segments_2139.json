["Ah!  wretched victim at seduction's shrine,</br>Who would believe thou once wert fresh and gay?</br>Poor faded remnant of a form divine,</br>Thou once wert beauteous as the rising day:</br>Thy heart could once on wings of rapture rise,</br>Thy reputation was without a spot,</br>Pleasure would sparkle in thy beaming eyes,</br>No mortal e'er could boast a happier lot:</br>But thou art now, alas!  by all mankind forgot.", "I have beheld thee beautiful and young,</br>As bright and pure as the unsullied snow</br>That to the mountain-top still fondly clung,</br>Tho' spring had dawn'd upon the vales below.</br>Thy step was that of nimbly bounding roe;</br>And, tho' thy soul was not restrain'd by art,</br>And all thou did'st irregular and wild,</br>Thou then possess'dst an uncorrupted heart,</br>Each action and each thought proclaim'd thee nature's child.", "But now, alas!  how hard it were to trace,</br>Beneath that pale and wasted form of thine,</br>One remnant of that loveliness and grace,</br>Which ev'n a cynic would have called divine.</br>Deep thought has dimm'd that bright and sparkling eye,</br>Whose glance could once give keenest extasy;</br>Thy cheek, where once the bloom which health bestows,</br>Might well have rivall'd summer's fairest rose,</br>Is pale as if thou'dst sunk in death's long calm repose.", "But time will come when he who ruin'd thee,</br>Shall feel the scorpion in his tortur'd breast;</br>Then thou shall be repaid for misery,</br>Thy grievous wrongs shall amply be redress'd,</br>And thy now shatter'd bark shall safely ride</br>In that far-distant long-desired heaven,</br>Where no rude storms disturb the peaceful tide,</br>And where to gentle souls like thine is given</br>To know the unfading joys that are but known in Heav'n.</br>"]
