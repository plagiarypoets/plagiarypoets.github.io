["And shall the Muse, so studious to declare</br>Its power in humble verse or rustic song,</br>Forget that now the tributary tear</br>Should flow where merit and where praise belong?</br>Ah, no!  The bosom fraught with Beauty's fire</br>Shall change to mournful song the animated lyre.", "Where native sweetness and its charms prevail,</br>Where Beauty smiles beyond the reach of art</br>The Muse shall dare to sing; &mdash; tho' what avail,</br>If gloomy sorrow pierce the feeling heart?</br>'Twere vain in pensive numbers to deplore,</br>Since Beauty's power is fled, and sweetness charms no more.", "Yet still, whate'er was form'd to give delight,</br>To captivate the will, or charm the sense,</br>Cast in the fairest mould, did there unite,</br>And all the heartfelt joys of love dispense:</br>On whose soft notes my ravish'd ear has hung,</br>And bless'd the melting sweetness falling from her tongue.", "Not Philomela's soft melodious strains</br>Sound half so sweet, when thro' the twilight grove</br>The pensive warbler to the Moon complains,</br>And tells her melancholy tale of love.</br>Alas!  no tuneful warblings can inspire,</br>No voice like her's can charm, and kindle fond desire.", "E'en the sweet Linnet on the blooming spray</br>Attempts in vain its power to declare;</br>Dull are its notes, and dull its warbling lay,</br>While Love and Beauty entertain the ear.</br>Alas!  'twere vain for Merit to aspire,</br>For charms unrivall'd still here set the heart on fire.", "Yet what avails it that th' exuberant tear,</br>The heart-felt sigh, the tributary verse,</br>Should thus employ a long, a fruitless care,</br>And strive the charms of Beauty to rehearse;</br>When Absence, cruel Pow'r, no pray'rs can move,</br>No tear can soften, nor the gentle voice of Love!", "Adieu, ye shades!  and you, ye flow'ry plains!</br>Who oft have witness'd to my tender vows!</br>Adieu!  since here no more melodious strains</br>Shall charm the sense, and lull to soft repose.</br>Ah yes!  the purling streams and flowery lawn</br>Shall but re-echo back my solitary moan.", "For ah!  what now to me are flow'ry fields,</br>The spring's gay vesture, or the shady grove,</br>Or all the beauties which kind Nature yields,</br>Depriv'd and destitute of her I love?</br>To this pall'd sense no pleasure can remain,</br>For flow'ry fields and shades can but increase my pain.", "Oh!  would some fond, indulgent Muse but give</br>Its kind attention to a Votary's pray'r,</br>In never dying verse her charms should live,</br>And future Ages bless the friendly tear</br>That flow'd where Love and Beauty bore a part,</br>And ABSENCE, cruel ABSENCE, pierc'd the bleeding heart.</br>"]
