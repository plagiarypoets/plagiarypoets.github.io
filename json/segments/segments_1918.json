["Daughter of Innocence, descend,</br>Thou stranger to repining Care;</br>Whose breast no serious passions rend,</br>Let human hearts thy influence share,</br>Why wilt thou still our eager search elude,</br>And thy fair form seclude?", "Tho' Plenty decks the sumptuous board,</br>And gaudy Splendour rules the feast;</br>Can these felicity afford,</br>If thou, Content, be not a guest?</br>Not all the wealth that rears an Indian throne</br>Thy absence can atone.", "See idle Folly's frantic train,</br>Loud Riot rules their midnight hour;</br>Their bosoms, rack'd with guilty pain,</br>Ne'er own'd thy soothing, balmy power.</br>Remorse with deadly venom points her dart;</br>They feel the rankling smart.", "The simple hind, whose lowly cot,</br>Thy ever-placid smiles adorn;</br>Blest in his undistinguish'd lot,</br>With joy salutes each rising morn;</br>And when he quits his daily toils for rest,</br>No evil haunts his breast.", "Be thou, O Nymph, my constant guide,</br>Thro' varying life's tempestuous seas;</br>'Tis thou canst stem each adverse tide,</br>And find th' unruffled port of Ease;</br>Thou canst in ev'ry storm a calm create,</br>And smile at angry Fate.", "O grant me oft the temp'rate bliss</br>With thee to pass the silent hour</br>(To changeful Fortune's frown submiss),</br>In calm Retirement's shady bow'r;</br>Or with thy peaceful family to dwell,</br>In some sequester'd cell;", "Where Health is found with ruddy brow,</br>And Meekness flies the voice of Fame;</br>And Contemplation feels the glow</br>Of pure Devotion's hallow'd flame;</br>And radiant Hope, who darts her eagle-eye</br>To scenes beyond the sky.", "Sincerity, with artless mien,</br>Firm Faith, whom Doubt can ne'er annoy;</br>Thy beauteous race shall join the scene,</br>Sedate Repose, and tranquil Joy;</br>With Industry, who slavish Want disdains,</br>And spurns Sloth's lagging chains.", "Deign, Gentle Power, on earth t' abide,</br>And shed thy breathing sweets around;</br>Now o'er the social hours preside,</br>Now tread the solitary ground;</br>Celestial Happiness thy constant friend,</br>Shall all thy paths attend.</br>"]
