["I loathe to live, and yet I fear to die;</br>There is a dreary chill upon my heart;</br>I know that earth's a scene of vanity,</br>And from its toils and cares would fain depart</br>But from futurity appall'd I start!</br>I have no promis'd hope beyond the tomb,</br>And consciences' keen arrows through me dart</br>A dire conviction of my dreaded doom,&mdash;</br>Filling my troubled soul with agony and gloom.", "Now all the sins and errors of the past,</br>Rise up in dread array before my sight;</br>And dark despair hath o'er my bosom cast</br>Her pall of murky gloom as black as night.</br>Oh!  my forsaken God, forget not quite</br>Thine erring creature in this awful hour;</br>Shed o'er my soul a beam of heavenly light,</br>And by thy great, thine all-redeeming power,</br>Dispel the heavy clouds that o'er my spirit lower.", "Lo, at thy feet a suppliant I bow!</br>A naked, poor, and vile, and wretched thing:</br>Oh, come not with thy dreaded terrors now,</br>As to thy mercy-seat appall'd I cling!</br>Nor on my helpless head those thunders fling,</br>Which even angels might regard with dread;</br>But unto me the promis'd succour bring,</br>Bought by his gracious love who groan'd and bled,</br>And for rebellious man a life of suffering led.", "Cast me not off, my Father, and my God!</br>Though far from thee I long have gone astray;</br>I now, with humble fear, can kiss the rod</br>Of thine afflicting providence, and say,</br>\"Thy will be done!\"  'tis ours but to obey.</br>Yes, unto thee, the omnipresent friend,</br>The Saviour-Lord of all who keep thy way,</br>I fly, and on my knees before thee bend;</br>To thee alone I come, on thee alone depend!</br>"]
