["'Tis pleasant in the young fresh morn of May,</br>When blossoms bud, and flow'rets bloom,</br>To walk around, and hail the 'wakening day,</br>Through hawthorn-scented fields, and breathe their soft perfume;</br>But sweeter far than this it is to rove</br>Through the heart's fairy world &mdash; the early dream of love!", "'Tis pleasant in the summer's golden hours,</br>When clust'ring roses blush along our way,</br>To muse by cooling streams &mdash; in shady bowers,</br>Till Eve's pale beam subdues the god of day;</br>But sweeter far than this it is to rove</br>Through the heart's fairy world &mdash; the early dream of love!", "'Tis sad to watch th' autumnal vine leaves fall,</br>Faded and dying at the close of day;&mdash;</br>(Those emblems of mortality recall</br>Visions of early hopes &mdash; long past away!)</br>But far more sad than this, it is to mourn</br>The blossoms of the heart &mdash; that never can return!", "'Tis sad to mark, when winter's icy breath</br>Freezes  the stream, and strips the blighted spray,</br>All nature sunk in the repose of death,</br>Till spring's warm blushes wake her into day;</br>But far more sad than this, it is to mourn</br>The winter of the heart &mdash; whose spring shall ne'er return.</br>"]
