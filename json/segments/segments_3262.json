["O Thou!  (what e'er thou art, where e'er inshrin'd,)</br>That once wast Weekly, turn thy kind regard</br>A while on me. &mdash; Behold me sit disconsolate!</br>With down-cast eyes, by vile mundungus curst!</br>Yet thus depress'd, mark (warm'd with grateful love)</br>My sinking genius struggling with her fate,</br>Clasp the last remnant of departing song,</br>And aim to sigh in mournful sounds thy praise,</br>To sing thy requiem in her latest verse.", "Oh!  friend to life; to virtue; soul of both!</br>To death, thy victor, most effective foe!</br>Oh!  kind dispenser of the sovereign plant,</br>With all its native virtues, genuine sweets,</br>Ne'er did thy hand with touch unhallow'd dare</br>Debase for gain what god-like Rawleigh gave&mdash;</br>How have I bless'd thee, when surrounding joys</br>Brought on the balmy gale (the Zephyrs left</br>And all the plaintive plain) have clapt their wings,</br>And hover'd round my soul!  when all the Nine</br>With each delightful whiff have pour'd their fires</br>In streams of transport, on my swelling breast!</br>When Bacchus smil'd, as conscious that his glass,</br>Thus introduc'd, would more than doubly please;</br>When Venus laugh'd with all her Loves around;</br>For Venus and the Loves so soft and fair,</br>(Whatever vain coquets and fops may do)</br>Still court the fragrance of the spicy breeze.</br>Yet still the soul (her guardian, Pallas, near)</br>Shun'd the false joy of the superfluous glass,</br>Nor Beauty charm'd but with the Virtues led.", "But now alas!  how chang'd the blissful scene,</br>What sullen murmurs rise at partial fate!</br>While with dejected mien I breathe a gale</br>Rank, noxious, burning hot!  that prompts, alas!</br>The sip eternal, void of genuine joy!</br>That leads, with dwarfish steps insensible,</br>That foe to peace, gigantick drunk'ness on.</br>Reflecting deep on all the varying woes,</br>In varying shapes that load the wings of time,</br>On fortune's sport with sublunary joys,</br>(Those fleeting visions of deluded man,</br>For ever boding future wants and woes,</br>Their time a moment, their existence air,</br>When miss'd vexation, yet when grasp'd a cloud!)</br>But chief, oh!  Weekly, on my loss in thee,</br>Now fly the Nine, as once from him that sung,</br>Or strove to sing, on true Tobacco's sons</br>Saracastick lay, while folly tun'd the verse.</br>Oh!  ere they leave me, Weekly, let me bless,</br>Oh let me bless, the hand that bless'd so long,</br>Thy hand now cold:  but ah!  they haste away.</br>Rest to thy dust &mdash; and transport to thy soul!</br>Blest be thy mem'ry &mdash; and eternal too!</br>More struggles in my breast &mdash; but &mdash; puff &mdash; alas,</br>This drowsy weed &mdash; binds up my falt'ring tongue,</br>Damps all &mdash; puff &mdash; my thoughts &mdash; and &mdash; puff&mdash;</br>I sink to slumbers, and can &mdash; sing &mdash; no more.</br>"]
