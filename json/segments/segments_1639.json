["My own, my dearest &mdash;, wilt thou hear</br>From one who fondly loves thee, and surveys</br>Thy noble mind with admiration's tear,</br>And often dwells delighted on its praise;</br>Ah!  wilt thou hear admonitory lays?</br>The tender chidings of a heart that glows</br>Whenever joy illumes thy checquer'd days;</br>Bleeds in compassion o'er thy bosom's woes,</br>And sympathizing seeks to lull them to repose?", "Oh!  I would have thee shun the gloomy thought</br>That with misanthropy beclouds thy mind!</br>Let not its lofty sentiments be fraught</br>With hatred for thy brethren of mankind:</br>Perfection, here, alas!  we cannot find;</br>But wrath indignant never yet could move</br>To penitence the soul to vice resign'd:</br>Oh, no!  'tis pitying forgiving love,</br>Which, o'er the erring heart, alone will conquering prove.", "Spirit sublime!  ah!  thou art here alone&mdash;</br>I've watch'd thee oft, through many a varying mood,</br>Mark'd sensibility's profoundest tone,</br>And wept to view thy bosom's solitude:</br>And yet, I trust 'tis for thy final good;</br>Not always too perhaps it shall be so;</br>A friend my yet be giv'n to thee, endued</br>With all thou seekest, even here below:</br>At least, in Heav'n a kindred spirit thou shalt know.", "One friend there is, my &mdash;, ever near,</br>And ever ready sympathy to give;</br>Who thy complaints compassionate will hear,</br>With pow'r and will each sorrow to relieve.</br>Dost thou untouch'd, uninterested grieve?</br>Oh!  He is good, beyond what words can say;</br>Pure, perfect, changeless:  Him in faith receive,</br>Such as discover'd by the Gospel's ray,</br>And safely thou shalt walk through life's most dang'rous way.", "Think not I mean to hint the dreadful fear</br>That this support thou dost neglect to find;</br>I know, devotion, ardent and sincere,</br>Entrances oft thy warm, enthusiast mind:</br>But when I see those reasoning pow'rs refin'd</br>Perhaps too boldly, sacred themes pursue,</br>And to the sceptic's cavilling inclin'd,</br>I tremble, lest the Sun's too dazzling hue</br>Should blind, or dim, thy intellectual view.", "Reason, though noblest attribute of Man,</br>Is yet imperfect in this fallen sphere;</br>Strive as it will, it cannot grasp the plan</br>Which fram'd us as we are, and plac'd us here:</br>In humble silence let us then revere,</br>What we hereafter shall completely know.</br>Oh!  when confiding trust, with faith sincere,</br>And holy love, within our bosoms glow,</br>We taste the highest bliss conferr'd on Man below!</br>"]
