["I dreamt of Arqua, and the hallow'd tomb</br>Where sleeps the lyre, whose undulating string</br>Stream'd notes of lady-love among the bloom</br>Of music-breathing flow'rs, in early spring:</br>Their dew, love's tears &mdash; the fragrance of which they fling</br>On earth and air, the odour of the sigh</br>Of her so lov'd &mdash; the hue, bright as the wing</br>Of Iris, was the love-smile of her eye,</br>That beam'd upon the chords with softest witchery.</br>"]
