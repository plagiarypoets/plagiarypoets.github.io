["CORYDON TO HIMSELF.</br>Ah!  Corydon, why dost thou stray</br>From the plains thou wer't wont to admire?</br>Or why dost thou wander away,</br>From the cot that was once thy desire?", "LAURA CASUALLY MEETING HIM.</br>O hear!  'tis the same now with me,</br>I wander, yet I know not for why;</br>But mistaken's my path as you see,</br>And it makes you, blithe shepherd, look shy.", "CORYDON.</br>Why shy does bright Laura appear?</br>Is she vex'd she has met with her swain?</br>Perhaps we each other may cheer,</br>Our lost road we perhaps may regain.", "LAURA.</br>O Lord!  nay, what time have I lost,</br>I'll go seek my poor sheep with all speed;</br>They wonder in what I've been cross'd,</br>I must leave you, young shepherd, indeed.", "CORYDON.</br>With leave I will tend o'er your sheep,</br>I will watch them by day and by night;</br>Will sing till your flocks are asleep,</br>And when wak'd, they shall be my delight.", "LAURA.</br>Oh!  Corydon, you are too kind,</br>To make them so much all your care;</br>To absence they'd soon be resign'd,</br>But I love them, and cannot forbear.", "CORYDON.</br>Dear lass, sure you do not mistake,</br>Or can think I e'er wish'd you to fly;</br>No, I hope you'll them never forsake,</br>If you do, they will certainly die.", "LAURA.</br>Ah me!  I've forgot my lov'd crook,</br>I have left it, and cannot tell where?</br>Perhaps 'tis beside yonder brook,</br>I'll go fetch it, and bring it you here.", "CORYDON.</br>Then both to the brook let's repair,</br>And the groves with our harmony fill;</br>I'll then lead you on, my sweet fair,</br>To the cottage that stands on yon hill.", "LAURA.</br>The distance indeed is too long,</br>Lazy hours I am sure I've but few;</br>When we meet next I'll give you a song,</br>And so now, gentle shepherd, adieu.</br>"]
