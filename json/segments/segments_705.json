["Bold was the man, as Horace somewhere sings,</br>Who first in fragile bark, adven'trous, try'd</br>T' explore old Ocean's undiscover'd springs,</br>And view, unmov'd, the monsters of the tides.</br>See the trim vessel o'er the billows ride!</br>To distant climates cut her liquid way;</br>And safe return with orient's richest pride,</br>The pearl sea-latent, and the gem, whose ray</br>Would emulate in small the glorious lamp of day.", "Thus Argo, fraught with demi-gods of old,</br>With shouts of victory to Colchis bore</br>In triumph thro' the seas, the fleecy gold,</br>Thus too fair Tyre (to credit antient lore)</br>Erst Carthage  hight &mdash; new regions to explore,</br>Sent from her breast th' amphibious progeny</br>Which reach'd e'en Thule's unfrequented shore,</br>And taught the naked savage to supply</br>The cassiterid grains of glossy, silver'd dye.", "He too the subject of Portia's theme</br>Should shine, whom distant ages must approve,</br>'Yclept Columbus &mdash; near ally'd in name,</br>In actions nearer &mdash; to the peaceful dove,</br>By Noah sent in quest of land to rove.</br>Hispania glad the wandering patriot view'd,</br>Return'd with olive crown'd in peace and love;</br>Oh!  had her sons his lenient plans pursu'd,</br>Guiltless alike of fraud, and shedding human blood!", "Gladly would I th' unwilling tale refrain,</br>And, not approving, spare, at least, to blame;</br>But honest ardour prompts th' indignant strain,</br>And meek Religion's much perverted name.</br>Ah!  cease, blind zeal, thy persecuting flame,</br>Has sated ignorance no cause to plead?</br>Thy God, tho' pontiffs may dispense, will claim</br>That blood, which thou so causeless hast shed,</br>And lay, with heavier weight, on thy devoted head.", "But God is just &mdash; behold, by force acquir'd,</br>Peruvia's gem, and rich Potosi's ore.</br>Say where's thy fancy'd happiness retir'd?</br>Dost thou not languish 'midst the shining store?</br>And have not countless millions made thee poor?</br>While, thro' thy sieve, the liquid treasures flow,</br>T' enrich Hollandia's more propitious shore,</br>To teach 'midst Belgic boys the flax to grow,</br>And shew what art, push'd on by industry, can do.", "Not so did Albion, Freedom's genuine child,</br>She sent her sons to cut the western wave,</br>Humane, not weak; tho' resolute, yet mild;</br>Not sparing those who milder means might save,</br>Nor pocketing th' affront she never gave.</br>She hop'd, nor vain, I trust, that hope will be,</br>To see the savage, by her precepts brave,</br>Fostering young science in th' Hesperian sea,</br>Assert his birthright claim, and nobly dare be free.</br>"]
