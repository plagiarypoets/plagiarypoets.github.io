["Far from the bustling city's noise and pride,</br>Within the bosom of a silent vale,</br>A village stands, fast by a stream's smooth glide,</br>That pours in mazy lapse along the Dale,</br>There dwells a Quaker, shunning mortal strife,</br>Who thinks a virtuous peace the dearest pledge of life.", "From neither dress nor principles he swerves,</br>But is thro' half a century the same;</br>When perfect manhood strung his vig'rous nerves,</br>As now relaxing age has bow'd his frame,</br>Simple alike his manners and his sense,</br>Impress'd with ancient form and strong benevolence.", "Strong for an intuitive pow'r, he pleads,</br>Some emanation of th' Eternal Light;</br>An energetic rule; beyond all Creeds,</br>An home-felt fount and test of all that's right;</br>Not to one people injuriously confin'd,</br>But like the orb of day, enlightens all mankind.", "All war and rapine zealously he blames,</br>And madding Kings in human gore imbu'd;</br>Yet, not displeas'd, hears Gaul's despotic aims</br>In her sequacious thousands are subdu'd;</br>Nor with reluctance hears the martial tale,</br>That GEORGE'S free-born legions thro' the world prevail.", "No gay romance he reads, nor wicked play,</br>Nor can their page a sanctuary find,</br>But each polluting book is cast away,</br>That wakes th' unruly passions of the mind;</br>While to the Bible he with fervour cleaves,</br>And to a puff'd up world each Heath'nish Author leaves.", "With ev'ry Tax he cordially complies,</br>Save dues of Ministers by men ordain'd,</br>Ashdod nor Ashtaroth more his soul denies,</br>Than these from carnal ordinances claim'd;</br>His neigh'bring Pastor, with unweary'd pains,</br>His error still display, yet still no progress gains.", "But yet in mutual amity they live,</br>For Charity prevents indecent strife;</br>Tho' retrograde their Faith, they both believe,</br>This the blest essence of a Christian life;</br>The Vicar yet suspects these scruples vain,</br>While him the Quaker deems of Levi's tythe-taught train.", "His itinerant brother, preaching to and fro,</br>Should he unbidden call to be his guest,</br>His bosom wakes to friendship's cordial glow,</br>And while he blesses, finds himself more blest.</br>Grasping his hand, the pious kiss bestows,</br>While his expanded soul in kind endearment flows.", "He then invites his neighbours to partake</br>The simple boon his friend may soon dispense,</br>When the tun'd thoughts more deep impressions make,</br>Unfelt by him from elevated sense;</br>And ever and anon his gen'rous mind</br>In aspiration breaks, and groans for human kind.", "If fierce disputes among his neighbours rise,</br>Him Arbiter contesting parties choose;</br>With simple sense he Error's maze descries,</br>Nor shuns to bring these talents into use;</br>Coolly impartial weighs each dubious side,</br>And wisely pleases both, ere he their claims decide.", "He exhorts his children round (a goodly train!)</br>To shun the follies of a trifling age;</br>From each seducing gewgaw to refrain,</br>That the warp'd soul from Virtue's path engage;</br>Then turns his retrospect to better days,</br>Damsels of yore plain clad, and youth deserving praise.", "And oft reminds them of their ancestry,</br>Superior to their persecutors pow'r,</br>Who from coercive hands disdain'd to fly,</br>Nor shunn'd the cruel jaw that would devour;</br>Then rais'd almost to wrath, condemns the crimes,</br>Of Cromwell's zeal-blind days, and Charles's giddy times.", "Their zeal he tells, and how they fervent stood,</br>And grew beneath th' oppressor's galling yoke,</br>Not fine, nor durance, banishment, nor blood,</br>Their strong allegiance to their duty broke;</br>Then with a sigh recounts what change appears,</br>Since William's lenient reign, thro' George's golden years.", "That now, alas!  a deprevation spread,</br>Alike deceptive of the young and old;</br>On vanity's light wing the youth are fled,</br>And the deluded elders grasp at gold:</br>But then with pleasure views that some remain,</br>That have not bow'd to Baal, nor wear his servile chain.", "Not always grave; he takes a heighten'd view</br>Of life when new, and its gay joys recites,</br>What time when flow'ry minutes sweetned flew,</br>With puerile pleasure fraught, and new delights;</br>His sons attend their circumstantial Sire</br>Glow at his youth's emprize, and feel his pristine fire.", "What tho' his sinewy force is now decay'd,</br>Erst in the ring his vig'rous feats were seen,</br>Beneath his prowess fell that blustering blade,</br>And him the vaunting wrestler of the green;</br>With simp'ring glee recites those follies past,</br>Now deem'd vain-glorious sports, and joys unfit to last.", "On place nor person saintship he'll bestow,</br>Nor tread with reverence consecrated ground;</br>Nay, to the hallow'd fane he'd cover'd go,</br>Nor kindle at the anthem's sacred sound;</br>Except his own, does with no forms comply,</br>Unfeeling of the sneer for starch formality.", "The days and months he calls by Scripture lore,</br>True to the path primeval Patriarchs trod,</br>Christians, he says, no heav'nly orbs adore,</br>No Roman Chieftain, nor no Gothic God.</br>Then why should he pursue the Pagan road,</br>Adopt th' unhallow'd sound and long-exploded God.", "At large Assemblies where his friends resort,</br>He in the foremost ranks is active found,</br>Zealous fraternal order to support,</br>And that the ancient tenets lose no ground,</br>But chiefly that which strikes at priestly claims</br>He here to valour calls, and every tardy brother blames.", "Fervent for immortality he glows,</br>Unknowing of the Sceptic's wav'ring lore;</br>Regards this period as his final close,</br>When grief and strife and pain shall be no more;</br>Yet not to dumb oblivion quite resign'd,</br>Anticipates a name, when he's to dust consign'd.</br>"]
