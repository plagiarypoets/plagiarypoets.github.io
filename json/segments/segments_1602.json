["Small his reward for long and weary pain,</br>Save what himself can on himself bestow,</br>And little guerdon is the Poet's gain:</br>Few are the kindred breasts which seem to know</br>The holy raptures of the soul's full glow.</br>The freezing breath of cold and languid praise</br>Nips in their birth the fairest flowers that blow:</br>Vain task those plants to rear in wintry days,</br>Which scarce their buds unfold beneath Spring's warmest rays.", "For gentle and retiring is the Muse,</br>Unfit the thorny path of life to tread;</br>Nurs'd in the wanton sun and heav'n's own dews,</br>How shall she lift her sad and drooping head</br>Where the dim fogs of earth's chill desart spread?</br>The silent plaudit of one willing smile,</br>Which from affection's anxious lip is shed,</br>The eye which chastens, yet approves the while,&mdash;</br>These seeks the timid Muse, and these her course beguile.", "Such, dear inspirer of my early rhyme,</br>Such was the kindling praise I drew from thee:</br>Oft pass'd th' uncounted day in mingled chime</br>Of flowing undivided colloquy,</br>On all the lore of either poesy;</br>While thou wouldst bid the Muse, who idly stray'd,</br>And pour'd her matin warblings listlessly,</br>Her scatter'd blossoms in one chaplet braid,</br>And draw the violet forth from the dark poppy shade.", "Then what sweet hope would rush upon my sight!</br>What joyous visions my rapt sense illume!</br>Of everlasting fame, and promise bright</br>Of those immortal flow'rs which love to bloom,</br>Breathing rich odour round the Poet's tomb!</br>Oh!  may I from Death's still and shadowy wing</br>Snatch half my being, and avoid the gloom</br>Which o'er forgotten names Time hastes to fling!</br>Those not ignobly die, who not ignobly sing!</br>"]
