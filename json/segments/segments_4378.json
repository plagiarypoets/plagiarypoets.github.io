["Once I beheld, &mdash; how dear to memory's eye</br>Nature's wild scenes improved by novelty!&mdash;</br>The vernal tempest Arran's summits hide,</br>Move, sternly-low'ring, o'er the troubled Clyde,</br>Deepen the gloom of Cowal's hills of heath,</br>And wave his terrors over green Rosneath,</br>From Leven's laughing vale each charm exile,</br>And pour his wrarth on many a trembling isle.", "Yet one fair islet scorn'd his fierce career,&mdash;</br>Her fields unshadowed and her fountains clear,</br>As if his radiant shield some angel cast</br>O'er her young foliage, 'wept the tempest past.</br>Safe from the gusts that ravaged  hill and dale,</br>The waves rough-rolling, and the arrowy hail,</br>She smiled in loveliness, and on her breast</br>The storm-chased sunbeams found a place of rest.", "Bright shone that isle amid the flashing foam,</br>But brighter, lovelier far, to me is Home.</br>"]
