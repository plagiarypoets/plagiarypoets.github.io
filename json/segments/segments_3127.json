["What pleasures shall he ever find,</br>What joys shall ever glad his heart;</br>Or who shall cure is wounded mind,</br>If tortured by misfortune's smart;</br>Who Hymeneal bliss will never prove;</br>That more than friendship, friendship mix'd with love?", "Without or child or tender wife,</br>To soothe each care, each woe-born sigh,</br>Lonely he treads the paths of life,</br>A stranger to affection's tye:</br>And when from death he meets his final doom,</br>No mourning wife with tears of love shall wet his tomb.", "Tho' fortune, riches, honours, pow'r,</br>Had giv'n with ev'ry other toy,</br>Those painted trifles of the hour,</br>Those gilded nothings sure to cloy:</br>He dies forgot, his name no son shall bear,</br>To shew the man so blest once breath'd the vital air.</br>"]
