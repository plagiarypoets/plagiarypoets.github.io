["The fragrant wind that sweeps the groves,</br>And gently stirs the summer sea,</br>To other ladies brings their loves,</br>With shout, and song, and revelry,</br>And joy, and pomp, and warlike glee.</br>Go, climb the rock where sea-gulls lave</br>Their snowy-plumes, my page, and see</br>If through the Solway's murmuring wave</br>The vessels sweep which bring the brave.", "Forth flew the page, as eaglet flies,</br>To the smooth lake where cygnets breed,</br>When back he came with beaming eyes,</br>And faltering tongue, and breathless speed.</br>\"Oh!  brede your locks and trim your weed,</br>Wear heart and soul upon your tongue,</br>The sea is bright with banners spread,</br>And cavern'd glen and cliff along</br>Ring to the soldier's homeward song.\"", "O'er-mantled with her snowy veil,</br>She started forth, while, thickening near,</br>The breeze stretch'd many a milk-white sail;</br>And dames from cliff and mainland drear,</br>Flung seaward many a shout and cheer.</br>With warlike forms flash'd stern and prow,</br>Full many a lady hail'd her dear;</br>And many a fair cheek, wet with woe,</br>Wax'd faint, no kindred tongue to know.", "'Mid captur'd banners, streaming bright,</br>And laurell'd eaglets, sparkling gold,</br>Her warlike husband bless'd her sight;</br>Beside him, minstrel hoar and old,</br>Class'd him with kings and heroes bold.</br>All trembling with delight, she flew;</br>No alter'd main, no aspect cold</br>She met; but eyes all bright with dew,</br>And throbbing breast and rapture true.", "She clasp'd and gaz'd him o'er and o'er;</br>Unharm'd, he smil'd, by wound or scar.</br>\"Now this, she cried, is blyther hour</br>Than when mild July's bridal star</br>Illum'd thy path to softer war.\"</br>He kiss'd and bless'd his sobbing dame&mdash;</br>\"An my sweet lady's lovelier far,</br>Than when, all flush'd with maiden shame,</br>Unto her bridegroom's arms she came.\"</br>"]
