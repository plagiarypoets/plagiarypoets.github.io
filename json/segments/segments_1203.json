["O Spring, relenting maid!  appear,</br>Unbind again the frozen ground,</br>In beauty deck the smiling year,</br>And scatter vernal roses round.</br>O come!  and with thy radiant hand</br>In purple paint the western sky;</br>O come!  and let thy chearful band</br>Remove th' obstructing clouds, and bid pale Winter fly.", "By wanton Zephyrs fann'd, the rose</br>In pride surveys its opening bloom;</br>The violets every charm disclose,</br>And fill the air with rich perfume:</br>All nature is with beauty crown'd,</br>The trees resume their varied hues,</br>The richest verdure dyes the ground,</br>And every charm appears, to court the rural Muse.", "O thou!  by whose divine command</br>Each low'ring tempest left our isle,</br>Thy blessings deal with liberal hand,</br>And bid thy toiling servants smile:</br>Let Winter turn his gloomy car,</br>And yield to Spring's delightful sway,</br>Fly with his shivering train afar,</br>Nor with tempestuous clouds deform the rosy May.", "Unclouded in the azure sky,</br>Let the bright sun his orb display,</br>Each storm and threat'ning blast defy,</br>And chear us with his genial ray.</br>Let blooming Spring unrival'd reign,</br>An earnest of the grateful store</br>Which Autumn sheds on every plain,</br>And man thy praise shall sing, and thy great power adore.</br>"]
