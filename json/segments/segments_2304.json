["At opening morn I saw a blissful scene</br>As if on earth a ray of Eden shone,</br>A lovely form with countenance serene,</br>Which bending from the pure, domestic throne,</br>Pour'd forth a sacred hymn in warbling tone,&mdash;</br>One beauteous boy was sporting at her side,</br>And one in cradle dreams, like bud new-blown,</br>While o'er her varying cheek in smiles would glide</br>A guardian angel's love, blent with a mother's pride.", "At evening hour I look'd, &mdash; but wo was there!</br>On that young breast the spoiler's hand was laid,</br>Love's fondest hopes were lost in deep despair,</br>And horror brooded there in darkest shade;</br>The dews of pain had drench'd that sunny braid</br>Of clustering hair and dimm'd the eye's bright flame,</br>While clinging to the hand that lent no aid</br>Those cherub infants call'd their mother's name,</br>And wept in wondering wo, that no fond answer came.", "Again I look'd, &mdash; and in the house of God</br>Where late she stood, her solemn vows to pay,</br>Choosing the narrow path her Saviour trod,</br>With marble brow the lovely sleeper lay,&mdash;</br>They bare her gently to her bed of clay,</br>And smooth'd the turf while tears fell down like rain,</br>But the young mother to a brighter day</br>Soar'd high, &mdash; above the flight of care and pain</br>To wear the spotless robe in her Redeemer's train.</br>"]
