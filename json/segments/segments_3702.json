["In times like these, when POETRY is dead,</br>And all the magic pow'rs of verse are fled:</br>When ribaldry and satire guide the pen,</br>The shame of Poets, and the bane of men;</br>What strain Popeian the thick gloom pervades,</br>And sheds its lustre on those barb'rous shades?&mdash;</br>See HAYLEY rise, in him at once we see,</br>Held forth to view the Muse's Jubilee,&mdash;</br>Whilst imitative nature swells the strain,</br>Shakespeare in all his magic lives again:</br>And whilst our bard fair fancy's track pursues,</br>We trace the dawning of a Spencer's muse&mdash;</br>Copious as Dryden, and as Pope refin'd,</br>Bold to expose the follies of mankind;</br>Witty as Prior, and as Gray sublime,</br>He lives the motley wonder of his time&mdash;</br>Proceed, great bard!  in nature's bold career,</br>Heed not the low'ring of the Critic sphere&mdash;</br>Since Pope's great self the Archetype of song,</br>Hath borne th' upbraidings of an envious throng;</br>Who failing in the character they drew,</br>Gave to his sterling merit all its due&mdash;</br>So shall thy muse in late existence thrive,</br>And midst the storm of ceaseless Critics live!&mdash;</br>"]
