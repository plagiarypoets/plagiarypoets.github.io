["Now day conceals her face, and darkness fills</br>The field, the forest, with the shades of night;</br>The gloomy clouds are gathering round the hills,</br>Veiling the last ray of the lingering light.</br>The abyss of heaven appears &mdash; the stars are kindling round;</br>Who, who can count those stars, who that abyss can sound?", "Where are thy secret laws, O Nature, where?</br>Thy north-lights dazzle in the wintry zone;</br>How dost thou light from ice thy torches there?</br>There has thy sun some sacred, secret throne?</br>See in yon frozen seas what glories have their birth;</br>Thence night leads forth the day to illuminate the earth.", "Is there some vast, some hidden magazine,</br>Where the gross darkness flames of fire supplies?</br>Some phosphorous fabric, which the mountains screen?</br>Whose clouds of light above those mountains rise?</br>Where the winds rattle loud the foaming sea,</br>And lift the waves to heaven in thundering revelry?", "Thou knowest not!  'tis doubt, 'tis darkness all!</br>Even here on earth our thoughts benighted stray,</br>And all is mystery through this worldly ball&mdash;</br>Who then can reach or read yon milky way?</br>Creation's heights and depths are all unknown &mdash; untrod&mdash;</br>Who then shall say how vast, how great creation's God!</br>"]
