["I.</br>'Twas at the feast for City Honours won,</br>By TOM M'KENNY'S Son;</br>Aloft, in starch'd-up state,</br>The New Lord Mayor sate,</br>On the old Mansion Throne:</br>The Viceroy and his Sec. were there,</br>(A common compliment to Dublin's Mayor,</br>Ev'n should a wig-block fill the chair;)</br>The Aldermen had tir'd their jaws,</br>The Sheriffs carv'd with vast applause,</br>And Guilds-men stuff'd their hungry maws.</br>Happy, happy, happy wights!</br>None ever saw,</br>None ever saw,</br>None ever saw &mdash; such trencher Knights.</br>Chorus &mdash; Happy, &amp;c.", "II.</br>The Band were plac'd on high,</br>In truly piteous state,</br>As doom'd to play, while others ate</br>Some sav'ry dish, ragout, or pie</br>Oh cruel, cruel Fate.</br>At length the dinner pass'd,</br>And toasting Healths came on at last,</br>The bumpers circulated fast:</br>And with this glorious Corporation fun,</br>Came many a joke, and many a pun;</br>For Norbury, with jolly face,</br>Maintain'd Chief Justice Joker's place.</br>But hark! ... all mirth and joy is past&mdash;</br>The band strike up a loyal tune, the Mayor looks aghast!</br>All loyal hearts admire the well-known sound,</br>\"The Mayor is frantic!\" now they shout around,</br>\"The Mayor is frantic!\"  all the Mansion roofs rebound!</br>In furious state,</br>Now hear him prate,</br>Like braggart host,</br>He puffs and boasts,</br>And shakes his empty pate.", "III.</br>\"Silence,\" said he, \"that strain &mdash; let none presume to-day</br>A loyal toast to give, or tune to play;</br>Change ye that tune &mdash; it only serves</br>To shock the Rebels' tender nerves;</br>I would not, for my ears,</br>Alarm a Croppy's fears,</br>Or hurt the man who from allegiance swerves.</br>Who has dar'd, thus underhand,</br>Tamper with the City Band?</br>Now your City's low in treasure,</br>I'll enforce my sov'reign pleasure;</br>Low your treasure,</br>Sweet the pleasure,</br>Sweet the pleasure to command.\"</br>Chorus &mdash; \"Now your,\" &amp;c.", "IV.</br>The Viceroy thought the Mayor craz'd;</br>The Secretary look'd amaz'd;</br>And three-and-twenty Aldermen at Tom M'Kenny gaz'd.</br>The Band all saw the madness rise,&mdash;</br>His hideous looks, his furious eyes;</br>They chang'd the tune, and quickly play'd</br>His darling air, \"The White Cockade;\"</br>It sounds did soon impart</br>A solace to his heart;</br>But still, its much-lov'd notes excite</br>A thought of NINETY-EIGHT.</br>Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,</br>Fallen &mdash; in quite chop-fallen state,</br>Poor Tom's dejected quite.&mdash;</br>(When loyal Corps, their efforts tried,</br>To stop Rebellion's gory tide,</br>Which of their lists, although so many,</br>Enrolled thy name, O Tom M'Kenny?)</br>In mournful musing now the mayor sate;</br>For when he thought of valued friends,</br>Who THEN were laid so low;</br>Cut off by most untimely ends,</br>His tears began to flow.</br>Chorus &mdash; For when, &amp;c.", "V.</br>But Friendship now, with Heav'nly balm,</br>Came in, disturbing thoughts to calm;</br>HARVEY stept up, with prompt relief,</br>And kindly cheer'd our City's Chief;</br>Softly sweet he whisper'd to him,</br>Such weak conduct must undo him,</br>\"In tears,\" said he, \"why should they flow,</br>For scenes of twenty years ago;</br>Cheer up, my dear M'Kenny, cheer,</br>Come raise your head, and dry your eyes;</br>For, save myself, there's not one here</br>In all your sorrows sympathize.</br>Talbot, Grant, and Blunt beside thee,</br>Meath, and Bradford, all deride thee.\"</br>Thus were the sorrows of our Dublin May'r</br>Lull'd by Phil. Harvey's tender love and care.</br>The May'r, unable quite to hide his pain,</br>Gaped wide at Phil,</br>Who sooth'd him still,</br>Then sigh'd and look'd, sigh'd and look'd,</br>Sigh'd and look'd, and sigh'd again;</br>At last, with folly, grief, and wine opprest,</br>M'Kenny sunk on Harvey's faithful breast.</br>Chorus &mdash; The May'r, &amp;c.", "VI.</br>Not long reclin'd our worthy May'r,</br>For sounds like thunder make him wildly stare;</br>He marvels what these sounds can be,</br>And hears distinctly \"Glorious Memory!\"</br>Hark, hark!  the hated sound</br>Has rais'd up his head,</br>As awak'd from the dead,</br>And amaz'd, he stares around.</br>\"The Memory,\" still old Archer cries;</br>The Mayor now stands up,</br>And to slight William's name,</br>Hear him loudly proclaim,</br>\"Here's a bumper, so fill ev'ry cup!\"</br>But instead of the toast,</br>Which all loyalists boast,</br>The toast that he gave was \"St. Paddy's dear Mother!\"</br>The Nobles now, who grac'd</br>This wond'rous City feast,</br>Rise with one accord,</br>And depart from his board,</br>With indignation at the ribald jest.&mdash;</br>But hear, our shuffling, paltering host,</br>Tells why he gave not such a glorious toast;</br>\"Behold my list, and it will plainly shew,</br>\"King William's name I wrote, but then I wrote it low.\"</br>Trickster! &mdash; 'tis in vain;</br>To all the world 'tis plain,</br>HE COULD NOT LOVE KING GEORGE, WHO PLAC'D KING WILLIAM SO!", "VII.</br>The feast is o'er,</br>And days are past, now three or four:</br>Hark!  hark!  the City drums</br>M'Kenny to the Sessions come!!!</br>The mob attends.&mdash;</br>Oh!  what a train of most uproarious friends!</br>But where the Aldermanic Board,</br>Who used to wait upon \"My Lord?\"</br>Where's Trevor?  Warner?  where is Abbot gone?&mdash;</br>All who were on the judgment seat,</br>At Tom's approach, make quick retreat,</br>And leave the GLORIOUS MAN, so gloriously &mdash; ALONE.</br>And now may ev'ry future May'r</br>Take warning by this job,</br>And when he fills the City Chair,</br>Not stoop to please &mdash; a mob.</br>"]
