["Beneath this stony roof reclin'd,</br>I sooth to peace my pensive mind:</br>And while, to shade my lowly cave,</br>Embowering elms their umbrage wave;</br>And while the maple dish is mine,</br>The beechen cup, unstain'd with wine:</br>I scorn the gay licentious croud,</br>Nor heed the toys that deck the proud.", "Within my limits lone and still,</br>The blackbird pipes in artless trill:</br>Fast by my couch, congenial guest,</br>The wren has wove her mossy nest;</br>From busy scenes, and brighter skies,</br>To lurk with innocence, she flies;</br>Here hopes in safe repose to dwell,</br>Nor aught suspects the sylvan cell.", "At morn, I take my custom'd round,</br>To mark how buds yon shrubby mound;</br>And every opening primrose count,</br>That trimly paints my blooming mount:</br>Or o'er the sculptures, quaint and rude,</br>That grace my gloomy solitude,</br>I teach in winding wreaths to stray</br>Fantastic ivy's gadding spray.", "At eve, within yon studious nook,</br>I ope my brass-embossed book,</br>Pourtray'd with many a holy deed</br>Of martyrs, crown'd with heavenly meed:</br>Then, as my taper waxes dim,</br>Chant, ere I sleep, my measur'd hymn;</br>And, at the close, the gleams behold</br>Of parting wings bedropt with gold.</br>"]
