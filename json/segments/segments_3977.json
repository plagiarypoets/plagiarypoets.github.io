["O'er many a land and many a rolling wave,</br>Along the dreary bosom of the deep,</br>Alone I came to seek thy lonely grave,</br>And thus, a brother, mourn a brother's sleep:&mdash;</br>Vainly I come above thy tomb to weep,</br>Sighing to him whose slumber ceases not&mdash;</br>Vainly with tears that darkly roll I steep</br>Thy marble couch, and mourn thy hapless lot!</br>Yet, oh, my brother!  thou art not forgot!</br>And o'er thy tomb the wonted gifts I spread,</br>Such as of old above the sacred spot</br>The mourners scatterd to the cherished dead,&mdash;</br>And bid thee, kneeling o'er thy narrow cell,</br>Once and for ever, hail!  for evermore, farewell!</br>"]
