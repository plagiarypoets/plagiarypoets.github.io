["Well fare thy tender Muse, thou tuneful swain,</br>Who pour'd from pity's fount the plaintive song,</br>Soothing as LYTTELTON'S love-prompted strain,</br>To heal that bosom which hath bled too long.</br>Sure Heav'n in mercy did thy muse inspire,</br>To mitigate his grief, and quench affliction's fire.", "Nor thou, bright Excellence, that offering scorn,</br>That hallow'd offering of a soul sincere;</br>But hov'ring, deign, on cherub's wing up-born,</br>To mark with friendly smile the grateful tear.</br>And thou, forgive me, if I too presume,</br>To cast one pensive look on her lamented tomb.", "For, ah!  too well my sympathizing soul,</br>Can image in herself that weight of woe,</br>Which reason vainly struggles to controul,</br>In thy sad heart thus lonely left below.</br>Too well she paints the pangs of parting love,</br>So late depriv'd, alas!  of her own turtle dove.", "Yet why lament?  tho' Death's strong doors be barr'd,</br>And Fate inexorable claim his prize:</br>Who will complain that HEAV'N'S decrees are hard,</br>If soon we meet for aye in yonder skies.</br>Departed friends, alas!  return no more,</br>Yet we may join them on some happier shore.", "But whither soar'st thou, weak, unwitting muse,</br>The blissful regions of the saints to sing;</br>O check thy flight, and apter numbers chuse;</br>Such daring heights demand a seraph's wing.</br>Enough for her the world this truth can tell,</br>Well did she live whom &mdash; sung so well.</br>"]
