["The \"widow's mite\" ascended to the throne,</br>And brought the blessing of Almighty down.</br>Think then the comfort the fond soul must find&mdash;</br>What love and rapture must o'erflow the mind,</br>Of those who feed the widow and the child,</br>And pour into the souls the admonition mild.", "Thy charms, Benevolence, oh!  who can tell!</br>They fill the bosom with a magic spell!</br>The oil of gladness on our heads they pour!</br>They raise the spirit, as the genial shower</br>Doth raise the plant borne down by Sol's bright rays,</br>And tune the heart and thought to the Creator's praise.", "Thy 'semblance well the painter hath pourtray'd;</br>He drew the female, in full charms array'd,</br>Bending o'er where the widow lay distrest,</br>Her children's sorrows rankling at her breast;</br>Thou gave relief, and from the troubled heart</br>Drove care and wo, and bade all anguish quick depart.</br>"]
