["Behold in those lorn shades a Damsel dwell&mdash;</br>I ween the fairest amongst all the fair&mdash;</br>Awhile doth VIRTUE bid her sky farewel,</br>To live with Sylvia, passing all compare.</br>Eke Innocence doth leave her bower above,</br>To join her gentle sister of the grove.", "Yet what availeth, beauteous maid thy mien,</br>To mortals driven from thy dark retreat?</br>Ah!  what thy sparkling eyn of peerless sheen,</br>Sith lovers are forbidden from thy seat?</br>Soothly!  of little value is the rose,</br>Whose bell unseen in dreary desert blows.", "Soothly!  the balms of Araby the blest,</br>Are nought, if unenjoy'd their fragrance stream!</br>What is fair Luna in her silv'ry vest,</br>If ne'er she showeth to the world her beam?</br>Then break like Luna from her cloud of night,</br>And glad us lovely virgin with thy light.", "For thee, the Poet heaveth sighs how deep!</br>Yet, yet unheard they mingle with the wind&mdash;</br>Ah!  virgin well  my artless lays may weep,</br>Sith Spenser hapless plain'd for Rosalind.</br>Spenser, whose sweet song far surpasseth mine,</br>As Rosalinda's beauties yield to thine.", "Yet, trust me Fair One, I will verse indite,</br>And THOU the subject soft, to bring me praise:</br>Tho' LOVE be cruel, yet for laud I'll write,</br>And IMMORTALITY MUST crown my lays;</br>For sith thy charms, so much delighten FAME,</br>She'll suffer naught to die that holds thy name.</br>"]
