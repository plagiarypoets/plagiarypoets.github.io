["Where towers the castle o'er the craggy rock,</br>Where with his UNA sits the red-cross knight,</br>There SPENSER walks Invention's faery path,</br>And views through circling mists the golden light.", "Take we our stand amid the enchanted ground,</br>And see in arms the Paynim crew advance;</br>Indignant champions wave the vengeful steel,</br>In Virtue's cause they shake the threatening lance.", "Behold the terrors of a Gothic night!</br>The giant sorcerer grasps his massy shield;</br>Imprison'd beauty shrieks in wild alarm,</br>And fiends infernal skim the flaming field.", "It marks the genius of a barbarous age,</br>To see the wizard ride the foaming wave;</br>To see the spectre stride the blasted heath,</br>While forests crash, and storms destructive rave.", "The language and the thoughts are ancient all,</br>Speaking the temper of unletter'd time,</br>When superstition held her dreary reign</br>Down from the Pole to Afric's burning clime.", "Still o'er the nation hung romantic gloom,</br>Though Fancy call it England's brightest age;</br>For GLORIANA rul'd the warlike state,</br>While SIDNEY bled, and SHAKSPEARE rais'd the stage.</br>"]
