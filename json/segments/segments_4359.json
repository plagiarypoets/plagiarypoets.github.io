["Since Damon inconstant is grown,</br>Now fortune encreases his store;</br>And leaves his Lucinda to mourn,</br>Because she is humble and poor.", "No more I'll appear on the plain,</br>Nor the cause will I ever relate;</br>But far from the village remain,</br>And in silence weep over my fate.", "Ah why does my bosom thus beat!</br>Why the form he so flatter'd thus fade!</br>He surely deserves no regret,</br>Who can falsely forsake a weak maid.", "Let it ne'er in my absence be told,</br>The sorrow with which I withdrew;</br>For he that could leave me for gold,</br>Would jest at a maiden so true.", "Adieu then ungenerous swain,</br>Thy form from my bosom I'll tear,</br>If ever thou see'st me again,</br>It shall be when I'm laid on my bier.</br>"]
