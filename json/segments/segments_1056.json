["On many a wind upborn the Theban swan,</br>Safe in his strength of wing, the Heav'n explores.</br>Aloft on curling clouds he scorns the plain,</br>And through the trackless void securely soars:</br>Whilst like the toiling Bee my humble sight</br>Still loves the ground, nor tempts the dangerous height.", "With ceaseless wing, from flow'r to flow'r I rove,</br>Whatever sweets the freshen'd meadows yield;</br>The thymy copse I wing, the blooming grove;</br>From all with pain my little stores are fill'd.</br>Haply from these, as some propitious time,</br>The Muse collects her song and no ungrateful rhime.", "Not such the song, but nobler far attends</br>Caesar triumphant up the sacred hill,</br>When in slow Majesty his Car ascends,</br>And drags the chain'd Sycambrian at his wheel,</br>These Themes, my friend, thy bolder notes demand,</br>The lyre of Julius and a master hand.", "The muse of Antony shall best display</br>Our various joy, when Rome receives her Lord,</br>The pompous Sacrifice, the Festal day,</br>The Votive Games, for Caesar safe restor'd;</br>He comes &mdash; at once contentious discords cease,</br>Hush'd is the Forum, and the Bar at peace.", "Now the big Pomp, slow moving, floats along;</br>The sons of Rome, unnumber'd, pour behind;</br>Loud shouts of joy resound from every tongue,</br>And Long Triumphal Ios load the wind.</br>On to the Temples press the grateful train,</br>An hundred altars blaze, and Hecatombs are slain.", "That day, tho' all too weak, my voice will I,</br>Exulting, strive to reach the victor's ear,</br>For who can then restrain the swelling joy,</br>Or the tumultuous shout in silence hear,</br>Io auspicious hour!  Hail welcome morn!</br>Hail to the Sun's and Caesar's wish'd return.</br>"]
