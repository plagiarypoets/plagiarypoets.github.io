["Come take up your hats, and away let us haste</br>To the Butterfly's Ball, and the Grasshopper's Feast:</br>The trumpeter Gad-fly has summon'd the crew,</br>And the revels are now only waiting for you.", "On the smooth-shaven grass by the side of a wood,</br>Beneath a broad oak which for ages had stood,</br>See the children of earth, and the tenants of air,</br>To an evening's amusement together repair.", "And there came the Beetle, so blind and so black,</br>Who carried the Emmet, his friend, on his back;</br>And there came the Gnat, and the Dragon-fly too,</br>And all their relations green, orange, and blue.", "And there came the Moth, with her plumage of down,</br>And the Hornet, with jacket of yellow and brown,</br>Who with him the Wasp, his companion, did bring,</br>But they promis'd, that ev'ning, to lay by their sting.", "Then the sly little Dormouse peep'd out of his hole,</br>And led to the feast, his blind cousin, the Mole;</br>And the Snail, with her horns peeping out of her shell,</br>Came, fatigu'd with the distance, the length of an ell.", "A mushroom the table, and on it was spread</br>A water-dock leaf, which their table-cloth made.</br>The viands were various, to each of their taste,</br>And the Bee brought the honey to sweeten the feast.", "With steps most majestic the Snail did advance,</br>And he promis'd the gazers a minuet to dance;</br>But they all laugh'd so loud that he drew in his head,</br>And went in his own little chamber to bed.", "Then, as ev'ning gave way to the shadows of night,</br>Their watchman, the Glow-worm, came out with his light:</br>So home let us hasten, while yet we can see;</br>For no watchman is waiting for you or for me.</br>"]
