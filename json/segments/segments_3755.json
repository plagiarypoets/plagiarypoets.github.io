["Beneath the spiry rocks of Esk-Bagdat,</br>Beside the rapid Tigris SHADIR sat;</br>He sigh'd in secret for a Persian Maid,</br>And thus the pensive youth his love-sick soul betray'd:", "Beat on, ye waves!  Ah, what avails your rage?</br>The rocks, unmov'd, frown on the war ye wage;</br>So to KALASSA all my prayers are vain&mdash;</br>More hard than rocks, she laughs at SHADIR'S pain.</br>Roll on, ye billows!  still tumultuous roll&mdash;</br>What is your heat to that which swells my soul?</br>Weep on, proud river, till thy source be dry,</br>My streaming tears can every spring supply;</br>While life remains, these bitter tears will flow,</br>A life, alas!  too long betroth'd to woe!</br>From SHADIR'S love the fair KALASSA flies,</br>Nor heeds his piteous plaints, nor hears his sighs.</br>What fury plagues me?  wherefore burns my brain?</br>If woman scorn him, SHADIR can disdain.</br>'Tis madness all! &mdash; for who, that lives to love,</br>Would curb his passion, or his sense reprove?</br>The holiest Mufti of the Prophet's shrine,</br>Whose words are MAHMUD'S, and whose acts divine,</br>Might change his Koran for hymeneal lays</br>To solemnize KALASSA'S rapturous praise.</br>Tell me, great orb of love, of life, of light,</br>That in thy hottest noon now burn'st so bright,</br>That fling'st, exultingly, a shower of beam</br>On thirsty cities, forest, plain, and stream&mdash;</br>Tell me, oh tell, if in thy course there be</br>A nymph so comely, or so fair as she?", "My love is taller than the mountain pine,</br>More sweet her breath than cloves, her lips than wine;</br>Her fine blue eyes would dull the sapphire's blaze,</br>And when she bends the waving cedar plays.</br>Her curling tresses cheeks of bloom entwine,</br>So looks the rose beneath the shadowing vine;</br>Such ease attends her steps as Sultans love</br>When dancing nymphs in graceful circlets move;</br>And when she speaks, meseems the virgin's tongue</br>Pours forth the liquid language of the song.</br>But hence, fond SHADIR, nor exhaust thy tears,</br>Nor waste on scornful maids thy morn of years;</br>Hence to the War; there Glory waits, and Fame;</br>Preserve thy quiet, and forget her name.</br>As well the Dervise, in the desert hid,</br>Should rashly hope &mdash; dare he presume to bid&mdash;</br>The bois'trous Ganges turn aside his course,</br>The Nile's vast cataracts stop their tumbling force,</br>Rude Aboulsaken smile a flow'ry plain,</br>Or blood-like Arva draw a silvery train:</br>As well might false Apostates strive to bind</br>The voice of ALLA whispering in the wind,</br>In other spheres as well the planets move,</br>As SHADIR purpose to forget his love.</br>Ah, woe is me, to slander thus my race,</br>Pollute my blood, my royal stem disgrace;</br>Remov'd from thrones, and all the pomp of state,</br>Without a murmur sweat and labour on</br>Beneath the scorching of a sultry sun;</br>Fetch them the whip, or unsear'd stripes recount;</br>Trim the tall cypress, bid the lotus smile,</br>And, like a gard'ner, know the gard'ner's toil!</br>How chang'd, how fallen from the rank I bore,</br>PRIDE of the EAST! &mdash; and LORD of EARTHLY POWER!</br>Yet, did KALASSA recompense my love,</br>Whole moons of toil like pleasant dreams would move.</br>For her, and all those dear delights to share,</br>That mutual souls to bridal chambers bear;</br>To boast that bliss denied the proud and great,</br>Lov'd for myself alone, and not my state,</br>The silken sofa, and the feast I shun</br>For leaves and grapes unripen'd by the sun;</br>For, did she guess my birth, how soon her scorn</br>To servile smiles, to flattering looks would turn!", "Ten thousand lances march before the car</br>That bears my father MULEY CAWN to war;</br>Ten hundred thousand subjects kiss the ground,</br>Where his bright wheels have roll'd their axels round;</br>Mercy and Power at either elbow ride&mdash;</br>To save or punish is alike his pride!</br>When homeward borne the mighty warrior comes,</br>Welcom'd by sprightly flutes and thundering drums,</br>A thousand damsels loosely rob'd advance,</br>Beat the loud timbrels, and lead up the dance.</br>Rests the Great King &mdash; a troop of rival maids,</br>From Aden's markets and Circassia's shades,</br>Bright as the Houris in the heaven of Love,</br>With wanton sport or playful silence move,</br>Swell their soft bosoms to repose his head,</br>And bless the pleasures of the nuptial bed.", "To lull our sorrows, and our cares befriend,</br>For me, for mine, unnumber'd joys attend:</br>When the gay ensigns of the morn unfold</br>Their purple banners stream'd with refluent gold;</br>When up the East the eager Sun with grace</br>Comes laughing on, we saddle for the chase;</br>A thousand courses paw the indented plains,</br>Snuff the cool air, and shake their flowing mains;</br>With Parthian bows, and many a chosen sling,</br>And barbed darts that in their quivers ring,</br>With horns of ivory girdled at their side,</br>In Tyrian vests a thousand hunters ride:</br>Dogs, horses, elephants pursue the rout,</br>And woods and valleys echo to the shout.</br>The false Hyena feels the flying dart</br>Pierce her broad breast, and stab her savage heart;</br>The arm'd Rhinoceros meets the javelin's force,</br>And the bold Lion fastening on our horse:</br>The spotted Leopard's mark the victor's pride&mdash;</br>These, would KALASSA honour my embrace,</br>Herself, her couch's downy bed should grace:</br>These sports, this wealth, these luxuries are mine;</br>But these and more &mdash; my hand, my heart are thine.", "Or does KALASSA yet prefer the grove,</br>Her SHADIR'S gardens shall salute his Love;</br>For her alone the damask rose shall blow,</br>For her alone the paly lime shall grow;</br>The paly lime now bends the shading tree</br>To offer fragrance, fruit, and shade to thee;</br>To juicy orange and delicious pine,</br>The Syrian grape and citron's rind are thine:</br>There busy zephyrs fan the still alcove,</br>By palm-trees curtain'd, and contriv'd for love;</br>There ALLA bids the spicy shrubs exhale</br>Their balmy odours, and enrich the vale;</br>There in thy presence would I pass my days,</br>Nor think of thrones, nor war, nor songs of praise:</br>Or there, if prospects please my charmer's sight,</br>From high Kehoa's mosques first tipt with light,</br>To where the flaming chariot of the Sun</br>Behind the Western hills is wont to run,</br>On a pagoda's top the eye commands</br>Vast stores of cattle, grain, and cultur'd lands.", "Why then KALASSA, dost thou shun the youth,</br>Whose sighs are rapture, and whose words are truth?</br>Whither, my love?
