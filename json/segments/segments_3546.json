["Ah, what is't to me that the Grasshopper sings!</br>Or what that the Meadows are fair!</br>That, like the Field-Flow'rets, if mounted on Wings,</br>Yon Butterflies flaunt it in Air!</br>Ye Birds, I'll no longer attend to a Lay,</br>Your Haunts in the Forest resign;</br>Shall you, with your Truloves be happy all Day,</br>Whilst I am divided from mine?", "Where Woodbines and Willows inclin'd to unite</br>We twisted a blooming Alcove,</br>And oft has my Damon, with Smiles of Delight,</br>Declar'd it the Mantle of Love:</br>The Roses that crept to our mutual Recess,</br>And rested amongst the soft Boughs,</br>Are faded &mdash; they droop &mdash; and they cannot do less,</br>For Damon is false to his Vows.", "This Oak has for Ages the Tempest defy'd,</br>We call it the King of the Grove;</br>He swore a light Breeze should its Centre divide,</br>When he was not true to his Love:</br>Come, come, gentle Zephir, in Justice descend,</br>His Falsehood you're bound to display;</br>This Oak and its Honours you'll easily rend,</br>For Damon has left me &mdash; a Day.", "The Shepherd rush'd forth from behind the great Tree</br>(Prepar'd to make Phillida blest)</br>And clasping the Maid &mdash; from an Heart full of Glee,</br>High Rapture, 'twas told him (by Masters in Love)</br>Too often repeated will cloy,</br>And Respites alone were the Means to improve,</br>Or lengthen the Moments of Joy.</br>"]
