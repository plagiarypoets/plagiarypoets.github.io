["Hast thou ere seen a sunset in these climes,</br>And marked the splendour of our evening's close,</br>And heard the knell which lonely faqueer chimes</br>To daylight, when it sinks into repose</br>With blush more deep than what adorns the rose,</br>And calmer smile than that of dying saint,&mdash;</br>Reflected on the glowing mountain snows</br>In tints no artist's pen may ever paint,</br>Lovely, and lovelier still, as they become more faint?", "They soften into twilight; and the peaks</br>Of high Himaleh mingle in the grey</br>Of evening, &mdash; till the slowly fading streaks</br>Of light, concentrate in one lingering ray,</br>Upon the broad horizon.  Doth it stay</br>To promise, e'en as now it yields to night,</br>Another and another happy day?</br>Lo!  it has fled; &mdash; that last, loved trace of light;</br>And darkness reigns alone, where all so late was bright!", "Spreads the black shadow o'er a cheerless sky;</br>The dew-drop on the leaf hangs like a tear;</br>The jackall wails, with wild and mournful cry,</br>O'er nature's gloom; and all is sad and drear;&mdash;</br>Until yon crescent, mounting in her sphere,</br>A bark of light on blue and waveless sea,</br>Sailing through the wide heaven, so pale, so clear,</br>Blesses the earth's deep slumbers, o'er which she</br>Loves unobserved to dwell in silver radiancy!</br>"]
