["It is a sunny vision &mdash; a deep dream,</br>Too full of beauty for the heart to dwell,</br>Unpain'd, upon the dazzling rays that stream</br>Around the Bard's creations:  Music's swell</br>Voluptuous on the ear &mdash; the camel-bell</br>Borne softly on the distance &mdash; banners bright</br>Instinct with gems:  that Angel ere he fell,</br>And starry Eblis, in their mingled might,</br>Deluge each weary pulse with too intense delight.", "We turn away, with dim delirious sense,</br>From that so fervid blaze; and seek repose</br>From Eastern splendour and magnificence,&mdash;</br>From gorgeous palaces, and clouds of rose,</br>Sceptres and thrones and diamond-crested brows,</br>Pluming our spirits' pinions at the page,</br>Where sweet Floranthe warbles forth her woes,</br>In strains, of power each turbulent thought to 'suage,</br>And bid the passions cease their fierce wild war to wage.", "Surpassing Lyrist!  from thy powerful hand</br>The thunders and keen lightnings of the Muse</br>Speed forth in glorious might; &mdash; thou canst command</br>The noon-tide burst of Poesy; yet infuse</br>Its twilight calms and bloom-refreshing dews,</br>Amid thy deep conceptions, &mdash; and canst braid</br>Woofs rich and bright, with variegated hues,</br>As those on an Arabian heaven display'd,</br>Ere day's last rainbow-beams have vanished into shade.</br>"]
