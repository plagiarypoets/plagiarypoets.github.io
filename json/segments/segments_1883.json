["Oh!  mortal man how varied is thy lot,</br>Thy ecstasies of joy and sorrow, how</br>Chill'd, sunk, and servile art thou, or how hot</br>Flashes indignant beauty from thy brow!</br>Times change, and empires fall; the gods allow</br>Brief space for human contemplation, and</br>Above all partial dictates disavow</br>Unequal love; how can we, at their hand,</br>For individual fate a gentler boon demand!", "Childe Paddy parted from his father's cot;</br>It was not castle proud, nor palace high,</br>Extraneous symmetry here glitter'd not,</br>But turf-built walls and filth did meet the eye;</br>Loud was the grumph and grumble from the hog-stye;</br>Swans gleamed not here, as on the Leman lake,</br>But goose and ducklings, famed for gabbling cry,</br>With quack, quack, quack did make the roofs to quake!", "He thought of father, whom he loved, and left,</br>He thought of mother, at her booming wheel;</br>He thought of sister, of his care bereft,</br>He thought of brethren dear; and, to conceal</br>The endless pangs that o'er his brain did reel,</br>As through the vale his pensive way he took,</br>For fear his onward purpose would congeal,</br>He sung, while pacing with right-forward look,</br>\"Sweet Kitty of Coleraine,\" and \"Fair of Donabrooke!\"</br>"]
