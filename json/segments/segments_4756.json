["Where yon grass waves o'er the silent way,</br>And thriving weeds their branching arms display,</br>Beneath the lofty maple's darkening shade</br>Erst stood a dome of firmest pine-planks made,</br>To beechen posts the obedient ends were joined,</br>The flowery creeper all yon side entwined,</br>O'er half the fabric, were there seen to rise</br>An angled rood ascending towards the skies;</br>Oft on yon wall I've ponder'd as I view'd</br>The hungry inmates, there enjoy their food;</br>Heard the sow grunt, the barrow feebly whine,</br>While their shrill treble all the sucklings join;</br>When fill'd with food, how oft I've seen them lay,</br>Bask in the sun and catch his warming ray.</br>Then, if perchance as snoring loud they laid,</br>They heard approach the sty the kitchen maid,</br>Heard on the Trough the well known swill-pail sound,</br>Or the thick ears of corn fly rattling round;</br>How quick they started &mdash; oft I pondered then,</br>And oft compared the ways of hogs to men.</br>So the dull Democrat, his dosing keeps,</br>And till the loaves and fishes call him, sleeps;</br>But when he hears approach the long wish'd prize</br>To the full trough of offices he flies;</br>Though thousand offices the fool should clog</br>Still as insatiate as the ravening hog.</br>There, oft the swinish brood in gambols gay,</br>Sported the day and slept the night away.</br>Now all these joys are fled, as late I view'd</br>The site where once the cumbrous hog-pen stood;</br>No boar I saw his greedy jaws extend,</br>No parent sow, her infant pigs defend,</br>No squeaking pigs with pious whine implore</br>Their mother sow to yield her milky store;</br>Thither no more a summer's parting day</br>Shall the blythe house-maid wind her devious way;</br>No more the swine rear'd on their legs shall stand,</br>And ask the flowing beverage from her hand;</br>No more express their squealing rapture when</br>Loaded with corn the farmer seeks their pen,</br>Or when Aurora's crimson light appears,</br>No more shall whine their matins in our ears.</br>O Idleness, in thee the cause we trace</br>Of all the silent sadness of this place;</br>For had the farmer's yard with wood been stored,</br>The Sty had stood, and there pigs still had snored.</br>It was a winter's day, \"fast fell the snow,\"</br>And bleakly round the borean blast did blow,</br>When the stern farmer, so the fates ordain,</br>Doomed the warm pen no longer should remain,</br>Doomed the dry planks his kitchen fires should grace,</br>And the oak trough supply the back-log's place;</br>The swine astonished heard their cheerless fate,</br>And deep despair in every visage sate.</br>And first the good old Boar prepared to go,</br>Leave the warm sty for heaps of drifted snow;</br>He marched in virtue bold with solemn pace,</br>While the big tears bedew'd his manly face;</br>Not for himself he wept, the whining train</br>Of infant followers, call'd his tears amain.</br>The Sow in louder plaints expressed her woes,</br>With sullen grunt the mournful barrow goes;</br>Yet oft he pauzed and looked with wishful eye,</br>At the lone hog's trough and deserted sty:</br>The group of pigs, groped onward, far behind,</br>And squeaked their anguish to the sighing wind.</br>Now the rank hog-weed, shades the dark'ned ground,</br>And baleful night-shade spreads its vines around.</br>CETERA DESUNT.</br>"]
