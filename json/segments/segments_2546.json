["As late beneath a cypress shade</br>To rest, my weary limbs I laid,</br>Soft sleep o'er all my senses stole,</br>And fair visions charm'd my soul.</br>'Twas then, methought, at early dawn</br>A Poet trod the dewy lawn,</br>With solitary steps, and slow,</br>Where hoary Arno's waters flow.</br>The Muse he sought whose song of yore</br>Resounded on the Tuscan shore.</br>At length his vagrant footsteps stray'd</br>To Val-ombrosa's gloomy shade;</br>Where, stretch'd upon the mossy ground,</br>In death-like sleep the Maid he found:</br>And thrice essay'd, with daring hand,</br>To seize her thought-inspiring wand;</br>And thrice exclaim'd dread Pow'r!  arise,</br>Ere she unseal'd her long-clos'd eyes.</br>The waking Muse from side to side</br>Threw a wild gaze, and thus she cried.</br>\"What single Bard is this I see</br>Who quits the haunts of Men for me?</br>Of Vot'ries once a num'rous hand,</br>In Cosmo's time, adorn'd the land:</br>And is that band so num'rous gone?</br>And does Lorenzo reign alone?\"</br>The Bard a moment silent stood;</br>Blush'd a reply, and sought the wood.", "Alarm'd, upsprang the radiant Pow'r;</br>Rush'd from the dark sequester'd bow'r;</br>With awful voice call'd Dante's shade,</br>And summon'd Petrarch to her aid.</br>With active pinion mounting high,</br>She cut the pure Tyrrhenian sky;</br>As when Jove's bird in quest of prey,</br>Bends through the azure deep his way:</br>O'er the cold Apennines she flew,</br>And scarce bestow'd a transient view;</br>But having reach'd the Pisan shore,</br>On even wing she seem'd to soar;</br>Nor linger'd long, but heav'd a sigh</br>And pass'd Sienna, Prato, by;</br>Then skimming o'er Certaldo's spires,</br>Where gay Boccaccio felt her fires,</br>With chrystal woe bedew'd his grave,</br>That to the sod fresh lustre gave;</br>So often, from the sky serene,</br>Some heat-born drops to fall are seen.</br>With rapid flight, and eager force,</br>To Florence next she steer'd her course;</br>Expecting sooner Arno's wave</br>Should seek again the native cave,</br>Than not, it's verdant banks around,</br>Be heard the lyre's enchanting sound.</br>But there, alas!  no sound she hears,</br>Save busy hum of Cavaliers;</br>Who tell the daily tale of love</br>To many a Fair, in many a grove:</br>She found her Crusca's triumphs o'er;</br>And e'en it's name was now no more.</br>But Ig'rance rear'd her heavy head,</br>While ev'ry art, and science fled.</br>With shame, and woe, the Muse opprest,</br>Inclin'd her front, and heav'd her breast;</br>No longer tears bestow'd relief;</br>Their channels were shut up by grief:</br>But slow she sought the lonely plain,</br>To soothe her bosom's rising pain,</br>And soon the the melancholy Pow'r</br>Reach'd fair Val d'Arno's thickest bow'r.</br>As there she trod the sacred ground,</br>Immortal Milton's shade she found;</br>For mindful of the flame he caught,</br>When there he nurs'd his growing thought;</br>His grateful spirit loves to rove,</br>And haunt again th' inspiring grove.</br>As one whose day of wealth is o'er,</br>Without the Friends he sought before,</br>So she was half inclin'd to fly</br>To wander scenes of extasy.</br>The Bard approach'd the pensive Maid,</br>And deeply sigh'd, and thus he said,</br>\"O wherefore does thy flowing hair</br>Betray thy bosom's wild despair?</br>Has some dark Bigot's zealous rage</br>'Gainst thee presum'd fell war to wage?</br>Or is pale Death's unerring dart</br>Aim'd at some Friend's beloved heart?\"</br>\"Ah no, (replied the Maid divine)</br>No dread of Bigot rage is mine,</br>No suff'ring Friends in sorrow weep,</br>Those, those I lov'd are sunk to sleep;</br>I mourn that now no equal choir</br>Take from my hands the offer'd Lyre:</br>If then my sceptre's proud controul</br>E'er rul'd thy vast capacious soul;</br>If e'er thou stood'st with list'ning ear,</br>The tuneful Tuscan song to hear;</br>If e'er could please this vocal shade;</br>I now implore thy friendly aid:</br>Yes, I conjure thee by that lay</br>Which sung the bright celestial day;</br>Which sung the joys of Eden fair,</br>The serpent, Eve, and Man's despair;</br>By gay Allegro's sprightly glow;</br>By Penseroso's solemn woe;</br>By the sad notes thy friendship gave</br>For Lycidas' untimely grave,</br>When sunk so low his sacred head</br>Within old Ocean's dreary bed;</br>With sympathetic zeal, impart</br>Some comfort to my sorrowing heart.\"</br>With anxious breast, the Poet sigh'd,</br>And thus in trembling notes replied.</br>\"O Pow'r belov'd!  full well I feel</br>The truth thy plaintive lays reveal.</br>I'll seek proud Albion's chalky shore,</br>Where foamy waves tumultuous roar,</br>And there a genuine Band I'll raise</br>To hither come and sing thy praise;</br>For Thames shall sooner cease to glide,</br>Than I forget fair Arno's side.\"", "And now enchanting fancy leads</br>My wand'ring steps o'er flow'ry meads,</br>Where, proudly pointing to the skies,</br>High Fiesole's old turrets rise;</br>While on the stream that winds below,</br>Their sedge-bound locks the Naiads show;</br>And many a Wood-Nymph, many a Faun,</br>Trips sportive o'er th' enamell'd lawn;</br>While on the Fir-trees ever green,</br>The climbing Satyrs too are seen,</br>And, in the breeze their raptures pour,</br>With revel rout, and rustic roar.</br>As such delights my spirit cheer'd,</br>A Bard of Albion's Isle appear'd,</br>Who here had loiter'd down the day,</br>While sixty Moons had wan'd away;</br>And at his Lyre's majestic sound</br>The shepherd train would flock around.</br>Beneath a wood's extending shade,</br>Where many a Nymph so lightly trod,</br>She scarcely mark'd the velvet sod;</br>And with her numbers charm'd the ear</br>Of list'ning Eve who stay'd to hear.</br>The doleful Nightingale was mute,</br>Whene'er she struck the British Lyre,</br>With Grecian force, and Sapho's fire.</br>Nor distant far a Youth reclin'd,</br>Whose wild harp warbled to the wind,</br>So softly sweet, so clearly strong,</br>That Arno's self admir'd the song.</br>And now with eager haste I strove</br>To join the band that charm'd the grove.</br>But ah!  my labour all was vain,</br>For adverse powers my course restrain.</br>Confus'd at length my vision grew;</br>Fantastic phantoms rose to view;</br>Envy I saw, in yellow vest,</br>Malignant tear her shrivel'd breast;</br>And there the sullen race appear</br>Who scorn the glowing verse to hear:</br>Amaz'd I found the tumult rise,</br>And sleep, on hasty pinion, flies.</br>"]
