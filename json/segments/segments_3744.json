["Thou Touchstone of the human soul!</br>Of Virtue the stern, awful Test,</br>Whose fierce, terrific, high, control,</br>Subdues the loftiest, plumed Crest,</br>And makes the meekest heart repine:</br>The Thunder scaths the Mountain Pine;</br>It blasts the foliage of the Dale,</br>Nor turns aside to spare the Lilly of the Vale.", "Against thee, where's the Panoply?</br>Impregnable to Thee, what Place?</br>Nor Cots too low, or Thrones too high,</br>O'er all thy Ravages we trace.</br>One only Champion has the force</br>To stand erect against thy course,</br>Arm'd with invulnerable shield,&mdash;</br>Exalted Fortitude, &mdash; thou ne'er subdu'dst to yield.", "Ah, ruthless Power!  dare I complain,</br>That against me thy shafts are sped?</br>Whilst peace, whilst self-content remain,</br>Nor hopes of Happiness are fled?</br>Like Sickness, thou art hard to bear,</br>But real Friends come round the cheer:</br>Kindness can soothe the Throb of Pain,</br>When Gilead's Balm shall fail, and Opiates are in vain.", "Yet when thy Storms are hovering near,</br>FALSE FRIENDS to drop the mask presume,</br>As Blossoms fall, ne'er meant to bear,</br>Fair, but deceitful, steril Bloom.</br>But yet of Friends how few pass'd by,</br>Averting their stern, alter'd eye?</br>How many faithful, gathering round,</br>Pour'd Oil and Wine to cheer, and bound up ev'ry Wound?", "For hearts there are where still presides</br>Virtue, in all her health sublime,</br>Where ev'ry Duty fix'd resides,</br>Proof against Fortune's wreck, or Time.</br>For native worth, from selfish pride,</br>The winnowing Storm will sure divide;</br>As the light Chaff, along the plain,</br>Flies devious far away, and leaves the golden grain.", "When first Storm burst o'er my head,</br>You, Anna!  never kept aloof;</br>Such kindness through your heart is shed,</br>Your Friendship has been Tempest Proof.</br>For fraught with Candour, Sweetness, Truth,</br>In the gay Prime of smiling Youth,</br>When Pleasures on each hour attend,</br>Me then you generous sought, your chosen, earliest Friend.", "Your kind attention pours a balm</br>O'er troubles, which my Soul must bear;</br>Consol'd by you, it feels a calm;</br>You lessen Griefs you deign to share.</br>The noble Virtues of your mind,</br>With all the social Graces join'd,</br>Distinguish what you owe your birth,</br>And in my Anna shines her Father's genuine worth.", "Pity full oft is Sympathy,</br>When we ourselves have felt like woe;</br>Unwounded by Adversity,</br>You heal the ills you ne'er can know.</br>This is that Virtue those attain</br>Whose happy Fate is free from pain;</br>'Tis Godlike others Griefs to share:</br>For Mortals, Angels feel, themselves exempt from Care.</br>"]
