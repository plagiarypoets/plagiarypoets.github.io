["In SPRING of life, our early Friendship sprung,</br>With tender root, for yet the plant was young;</br>And may it still, with thriving vigour grow,</br>Nor the chill blast of cold indiff'rence know:</br>I fear not strife or envy, hateful words!</br>Heav'n roots them out, which strews fair Friendship's virtuous seeds.", "In youth's warm SUMMER, in the heat of toil,</br>And worldly care, when scorpion passions broil;</br>Whether the load of bus'ness press the soul,</br>Or love, which reason seldom can controul,</br>Still may the ceaseless stream of Friendship flow,</br>Our wearied minds refresh and quench the rage of woe.", "And, when the AUTUMN of our days draws near,</br>When our fond homes domestic cares endear,</br>Retir'd from bustle and each vain pursuit,</br>Then we'll enjoy fair Friendship's grateful fruit,</br>Ripen'd by time, its sweets increas'd, each day,</br>In one continu'd course and never to decay.", "And, last when WINTRY age comes on, apace,</br>Presents his feeble form and furrow'd face,</br>With virtue arm'd, we'll meet th' approach of Death,</br>Take one farewell and calmly yield our breath;</br>And, may Almighty Mercy grant my pray'r,</br>We'll meet again in heav'n, for ever freed from care.</br>"]
