["Beneath a rock, in rugged fissures torn,</br>The Bard of Morven lay at noon reclin'd;</br>Where, o'er his head, an old fantastic thorn</br>Diffus'd its fragrance to the passing wind:</br>His harp, in melancholy mood resign'd,</br>Near, on a blasted branch in silence hung;</br>While slow he ponder'd in his pensive mind,</br>The deeds of fame that fir'd his bosom young,</br>When dauntless Fingal fought, and grey-hair'd Ullin sung.", "As thus he lay, enrapt in sacred trance,</br>And from his dim eyes stole the silent tear,</br>An aged Hero leaning on his lance,</br>With wav'ring steps along the heath drew near;</br>'Twas Murno, weeping for his Uran dear,</br>His gallant son, in fight untimely slain:</br>Exulting forth he went to stain his spear</br>In hostile blood, on Lena's woody plain;</br>And there, in earth's cold womb, his lifeless bones remain.", "Rais'd by the old man's woe, the heav'nly fire</br>Thro' the mild soul of Ossian rushing flew;</br>Quick in his raptur'd hands he took the lyre,</br>And struck a tender strain in measures new:</br>Not softer ever was the breeze that blew</br>Through Selma's groves, or Cona's streamy vale,</br>When to the moon-beams glanc'd the nightly dew,</br>And ghosts of heroes, clad in misty mail,</br>With airy maids came hov'ring o'er the mountains pale.", "By Luva's streams (the sightless Bard thus sung)</br>In his grey tow'r did noble FORLOTH dwell,</br>For deeds of glory fam'd the chiefs among;</br>Many a dark foe beneath his valour fell.</br>Nor did his heart in kindness least excel;</br>Still in his plenteous hall the feast was spread,</br>And still went round in joy the sounding shell:</br>Well knew the stranger where at noon to tread,</br>And well at night the wand'rer where to rest his head.", "One maid of beauty blest his life's decline,</br>MINVELA, of the dark and glossy hair,</br>Form'd by kind Nature in her best design,</br>And fairest made of Morven's maiden's fair.</br>Many young chiefs had fought with ardent care,</br>Matchless Minvela's secret heart to gain,</br>No spark of love she felt; but, free as air,</br>On the green hills, among her virgin train,</br>Rejoic'd with flying shafts o'er the brown deer to reign.", "'Twas then by winding Carron's stream appear'd</br>Warriors unknown, and loud our chiefs defy'd.</br>Fingal's broad shield was struck, his banner rear'd,</br>And Forloth's steps of age were by his side.</br>They met; they fought; the banks in gore were dy'd.</br>Heroes unnumber'd pale and bleeding lay;</br>And scarce could night the doubtful strife divide,</br>But Forloth sure had sunk in death that day,</br>Had not young FINAN turn'd th' impending stroke away.", "To Luva's halls the grateful chief convey'd</br>The blue-ey'd Finan, in his shining car.</br>Come forth, he cried, Minvela, brightest maid,</br>And hail thy father victor from the war!</br>See, on this youth's white breast the bloody scar,</br>That sav'd me from the valiant stranger's sword:</br>Go, range the vale, the piney cliffs afar,</br>And wat'ry caves, that herbs of health afford,</br>Till to his wonted strength my hero be restor'd.", "Soon did the youth his wonted strength regain,</br>And soon Minvela breathe the secret sigh;</br>As from her harp she call'd its tend'rest strain,</br>In notes scarce heard, that instant fall and die;</br>Her bosom heav'd, and from each swimming eye,</br>Adown her glowing cheek the big tears stole.</br>Gray Forloth smil'd.  And Finan, list'ning by,</br>Felt nameless transports darting thro' his soul,</br>At ev'ry rising swell, and pause of fainting dole.", "The maid, this pining grief to drive away,</br>Resolv'd her woodland pastimes to renew:</br>Then on the hill she stood at down of day,</br>Her dogs, with feet of wind, swept o'er the dew;</br>And sure as death her feather'd arrows flew.</br>Sudden was heard the boding eagle's cry,</br>And from the howling desart wild winds blew;</br>Black clouds came rolling round the mountains high;</br>While deep and dreadful thunder rattled o'er the sky.", "On a white rock hung o'er the crashing wood,</br>Sat fair Minvela, leaning on her bow;</br>Raging, and all in foam, swift Luva's flood</br>Boil'd thro' the rocks and broken dens below.</br>How o'er it, lovely Huntress, can'st thou go?</br>For on that rock thou may'st not long remain</br>Dishevell'd in the blast, thy dark locks blow;</br>Cold round thy trembling bosom beats the rain;</br>And starless night will soon thy fearful steps restrain.", "Across the deep dark chasms, where roar'd the stream,</br>Its moss-grown arm an aged oak had hung,</br>And met the rock beyond.  There, while the gleam</br>Of lightning flash'd, and hills with thunder rung,</br>The shiv'ring hunter oft of old had clung,</br>And o'er the torrent work'd his per'lous way.</br>Far, far below, wild caves and shelves among,</br>The waters roll; and mists, ascending grey,</br>To bats, and dismal owls, afford a doubtful day.", "The pass young Finan knew, and now had seen</br>Minvela wand'ring on the bleak hill's side:</br>Thro' brakes he rush'd, and tangled copses green,</br>Till, standing high above the foaming tide,</br>Give me thy hand, fair maid, he joyful cried,</br>And joyful she her white hand smiling gave.</br>Trembling along the shaking branch they hied.</br>It cracks, it breaks, it falls &mdash; no strength could save.&mdash;</br>Down the dark void they plunge, amid the flashing wave.", "Forloth sat in his hall.  The beam blaz'd bright:</br>He fann'd its flame, and wish'd Minvela there.</br>A sharp scream struck his ear.  In wild affright</br>He rush'd, and saw his young, his lovely pair,</br>Wreath'd round the oak together in despair,</br>And swiftly shouting down the foamy flood.</br>With fruitless cries he filled the troubled air,</br>And all the gloomy night, in frantic mood,</br>Roamed o'er the wa'try shore, and thro' the groaning wood.", "Wretched old man!  I know thy grief too well;</br>Too well my harp has learn'd this dreary strain:</br>In pride of youth my blooming Oscar fell;</br>And last of all my race I now remain.</br>Once, like a tow'ring tree, I grac'd the plain;</br>Shoots round me grew, and flow'rs in fragrant rows;</br>But soon the winter's wind, and freezing rain,</br>Nipt each fair bud, blasted each smiling rose,</br>\"And left me naked, bare to ev'ry storm that blows!\"", "Long by the fatal stream he wander'd slow;</br>Long the wild mountain heard his bursting sighs:</br>His empty hall no more he seem'd to know;</br>Dark was to him the earth, and black the skies.</br>At length the distant shouts of war arise,</br>By Luva's bank sad Forloth hears the sound;</br>Reckless of life, to arms once more he flies.</br>His dark ships, launching on the lake profound,</br>Spread their white sails, and fly to Malta's rocky mound.", "On green Ferarma, in their course, they land,</br>Where the dun roes sport on the woody shore;</br>High on the rock two beams of beauty stand,</br>Young benders of the bow, with shafts in store.</br>Such was the garb my lov'd Minvela wore,</br>Cried Forloth, while swift tears bedimm'd his  sight,</br>And such the crested helm young Finan bore,</br>When down the stream, on that disast'rous night,</br>Wrapt in fierce storms, they sank for ever from the light.", "His well-known voice they heard, on this green isle,</br>Where by the winged stream they had been borne:</br>Quick to his arms they spring; and, for a while,</br>Their mingled raptures all expressions scorn.</br>The old man's heart, by gnawing grief long worn,</br>Again in purest joy began to bound:</br>To Luva's steams in triumph they return;</br>Once more, with dance and song the hills resound;</br>And in the hall, once more, the festive shell goes round.", "'Twas thus, O Murno!  thy lamented son,</br>Like Forloth's children, left thee in his prime:</br>But for a season is thy hero gone,</br>On his own stream borne to a happier clime.</br>And quick, O Murno, hastens on the time,</br>When thou shalt meet the gallant youth again;</br>His course now on the white clouds, that climb</br>The moon's clear face, when winds their force restrain,</br>And free the light ghosts wander o'er the starry plain.", "'Tis there contending warriors meet in peace,</br>And on the tempest's wing together ride:</br>There in the mutual feast all discords cease;</br>Lochlin and Morven sitting side by side.</br>For what can now their harmony divide,</br>When round them fly so thick the airy deer,</br>When the blue fields of Heav'n extend so wide?</br>No, happy shades, ye have no foes to fear;</br>And on your battles past ye drop a pitying tear.</br>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</br>"]
