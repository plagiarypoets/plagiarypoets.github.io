["Man is far more inclined to good than evil,</br>I care not what the learned Doctors say,</br>About his natural bias to the devil,&mdash;</br>His natural bias is to good alway:</br>Pernicious precepts taught from day to day,</br>And bad example, turn his steps aside;</br>Even his infant feet are led astray:</br>Now, is he borne along on passion's tide;</br>And now, is forward urged by prejudice or pride.", "The meteor impulse is his guiding star,</br>Where Reason's light can scarcely show him right;</br>He wanders here, and now he wanders there,</br>As shifts the phantom that deceives his sight,</br>Seeming to lead to regions of delight,</br>That in the distance meet his longing eyes:</br>Sometimes he onward strains with all his might,</br>To reach the goal, to gain the tempting prize,</br>And sometimes, heeding nought, in indolence he lies.", "Ever the slave of circumstance, his life</br>Presents a scene of inconsistencies;</br>His actions and his jugment are at strife,</br>And not from choice is this at war with these;</br>He does but follow the severe decrees</br>Of strong Necessity; or Habit pleads</br>Observance for her ancient usages;</br>Or Folly bids him imitate her deeds:&mdash;</br>Error's misguided child, for thee my bosom bleeds!</br>"]
