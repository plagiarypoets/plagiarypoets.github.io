["Oh day deplor'd!  thy melancholy dawn</br>On scenes of pangful apprehension rose;</br>And ere thy lengthen'd hours of gloom were gone,</br>Confirm'd the sad anticipated woes.</br>On all those joys maternal fondness knows,</br>Those hopes whose beams on distant raptures play,</br>Thy course beheld the veil of darkness close,</br>And quench the last fond gleam of pleasure's ray,</br>While sunk in death's cold shades a tender victim lay.", "And yet, Oh day of joy!  on whose blest morn</br>Descending angels bore the voice of peace;</br>Proclaimed on earth the babe of Bethlehem born,</br>While with \"glad tidings\" shook the distant breeze,</br>Born th' imprison'd spirit to release</br>From Sin's dominion, and from Death's dark sway;</br>To bid Mortality's deep murmurs cease,</br>And rend the separating veil away</br>Which wrapt in superstition's gloom the bright celestial day.", "How shall I mingle in the festive throng,</br>While memory renews distraction's hour?</br>Or how, exulting, raise the joyful song,</br>While my soul sinks in sad dejection's pow'r:</br>Yet though on earth despair's dark prospects lower,</br>This day celestial light dispels the gloom;</br>In heavenly vision bids the spirit tower,</br>And o'er the ruins of the darksome tomb</br>View scenes of love arise, and undecaying bloom.", "Father of boundless mercies!  Oh forgive</br>The tears which flow on this auspicious day!</br>Pity the heart where pining sorrows live,</br>When love and gratitude should swell the lay!</br>And from thy throne of light, may one blest ray</br>Of love, and heavenly radiance be given!</br>To free the weary soul from sorrow's sway,</br>(On her dark waves too long by tempest driven)</br>To lead her through a Saviour's love, to peace, &mdash; to Heaven!</br>"]
