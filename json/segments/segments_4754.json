["Prop'd in an elbow-chair, Fumoso sat,</br>With legs divaricating, and with heels</br>Recumbent on the stove's projecting plate.</br>Around his head, in sombrous volumes roll'd</br>The clouds of pungent smoke, from volute leaf</br>Of plant perfum'd, delicious with the scent</br>Of od'rous bean, dear bought, and brought from far!</br>His head sublime, thrown back in lofty state,</br>The ceiling's height contemplates; nor disturb'd</br>Its musing trance, except betimes to squirt</br>The sputtering streams of bland saliva off,</br>Nor minds the plaints of Betty or of Jack,</br>For brass resplendent sullied; or the spots</br>That mar the nicely blacken'd, shining face</br>Of Franklin's economic fount of heat.</br>While on the mantle stands the cheering glass</br>Of Gallic cordial, temper'd with the stream</br>Of limpid Schuylkill, which erewhile he sips,</br>And feels his soul expand, and dreams of bliss</br>Supreme, in Fancy's airy visions lost.</br>In his mind's eye he sees the blooming fair</br>Simper, or smile upon him; &mdash; she, for whom</br>He almost would resign the fragrant fumes</br>Of lov'd segar, and purify his breath.</br>But now Ambition fires his swelling thoughts,</br>With schemes of public good.  He dares to court</br>And win the people's voice.  The senate hears</br>His voice, resounding in her spacious hall,</br>And patriots listen, while Fumoso rails.</br>His hand aloft extending, wav'd sublime</br>In circle bold &mdash; alas!  the blazing top</br>Of taper sunk it strikes &mdash; the light's extinct!</br>His knuckles too are sing'd! &mdash; the charm dissolves!</br>His last segar begins to scorch his lip;</br>The drowsy watchman bellows \"dwelf a glock!\"</br>Fumoso starts!  relumes the extinguish'd wick,</br>And sadly silent seeks the sweets of sleep.</br>Sic transit gloria mundi.</br>"]
