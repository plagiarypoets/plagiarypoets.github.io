["Yet once more, glorious god of day,</br>While beams thine orb serene,</br>O let me warbling court thy stay</br>To gild the fading scene!</br>Thy rays invigorate the Spring,</br>Bright summer to perfection bring,</br>The cold inclemency of Winter chear,</br>And make th' Autumnal months the mildest of the year.", "Ere yet the russet foliage fall</br>I'll climb the mountain's brow,</br>My friend, my Hayman, at thy call,</br>To view the scene below:</br>How sweetly pleasing to behold</br>Forests of vegetable gold!</br>How mix'd the many checker'd shades between</br>The tawny mellowing hue, and the gay vivid green!", "How splendid all the sky!  how still!</br>How mild the dying gale!</br>How soft the whispers of the rill,</br>That winds along the vale!</br>So tranquil Nature's works appear,</br>It seems the Sabbath of the year;</br>As if, the Summer's Labour past, she chose</br>This season's sober calm for blandishing repose.", "Such is of well spent life the time,</br>When busy days are past,</br>Man verging gradual from his prime,</br>Meets sacred Peace at last:</br>His flowery Spring of pleasures o'er,</br>And Summer's full-blown pride no more,</br>He gains pacific Autumn, mild and bland,</br>And dauntless braves the stroke of Winter's palsied hand.", "For yet a while, a little while,</br>Involv'd in wintry gloom,</br>And lo!  another Spring shall smile,</br>A Spring eternal bloom;</br>Then shall he shine, a glorious guest,</br>In the bright mansions of the blest,</br>Where due rewards on Virtue are bestow'd,</br>And reap the golden fruits of what his Autumn sow'd.</br>"]
