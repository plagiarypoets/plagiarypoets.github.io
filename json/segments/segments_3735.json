["Adieu, ye scenes of soft delight!</br>Scarce childhood's happy reign is o'er,</br>When swiftly fading from my sight,</br>I view your fairy charms no more.</br>Adieu, ye pleasing forms divine!</br>Which fancy bade around me shine,</br>When fair as summer's cloudlike skies,</br>Hope's sunny landscape met these eyes,</br>And health flush'd high my cheek with morning's roseate dyes.", "Farewell, ye flowery meads and groves!</br>Ye lawns, high woods, and cloister'd dells!</br>Where spring a Sylvan goddess roves,</br>And nature unmolested dwells!</br>Ye scenes, which once the Muse held dear,</br>As listening oft she deign'd to hear</br>Her votary pour his untaught strain,</br>When light of heart, and free from pain,</br>He bade his numbers wild glide gently o'er the plain.", "This sickening heart, by grief oppress'd,</br>No longer glows with genial fire,</br>No more to mirth a tuneful guest,</br>I seek to wake the warbling lyre:</br>Mute are its springs to him who strives,</br>When sorrow keen his bosom rives,</br>Joy's blissful passion to refrain,</br>Wisdom then teach me to refrain,</br>And hide from public view \"Adversity's sad train.\"</br>"]
