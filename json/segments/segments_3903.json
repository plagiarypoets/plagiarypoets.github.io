["Where the light cannot pierce in a grove of tall trees,</br>With my fair one as blooming as May,</br>Undisturb'd by all sound but the sighs of the breeze</br>Let me pass the hot noon of the day.", "When the Sun less intense to the westward inclines,</br>For the meadows the groves we'll forsake,</br>And see the rays dance as inverted he shines,</br>On the face of some river or lake.", "Where my fairest and I, on its verge as we pass,</br>For 'tis she that must still be my theme,</br>Our two shadows may view on the wat'ry glass,</br>While the fish are at play in the stream.", "May the herds cease to lowe, and the lambkins to bleat,</br>When she sings me some amorous strain;</br>All be silent, and husht, unless echo repeat</br>The kind words, and sweet sounds back again.", "And when we return to our cottage at night,</br>Hand in hand as we sauntering stray,</br>Let the moon's silver beams thro' the leaves give us light,</br>Just direct us, and chequer our way.", "Let the nightingale warble its notes in our walk,</br>As thus gently and slowly we move;</br>And let no single thought be express'd in our talk,</br>But of friendship improv'd into love.", "Thus enchanted each day with these rural delights,</br>And secure from ambition's alarms,</br>Soft love and repose shall divide all our nights,</br>And each morning shall rise with new charms.</br>"]
