["Ye shepherds attend to my lay,</br>Your Corydon's loss to deplore!</br>Time was, when like you, I was gay,</br>But I ne'er shall know happiness more;</br>My sheep they must wander alone,</br>And crop the sweet grass as they rove,</br>For Corydon's cares of his own,</br>Since Phillida has slighted his love.", "How oft with my frolicksome Tray</br>I have saunter'd the woodlands among;</br>But I frighten'd no birds from the spray,</br>I never molested their young:</br>In safety they warbled their song,</br>The larks and the linnets so gay;</br>I took but my dog, and my gun,</br>A pretence for to wander that way.", "When we've promis'd each other to meet,</br>And Phillis should happen to stray,</br>How oft, with my dog at my feet,</br>I have pip'd the slow hours away:</br>Ah!  then shou'd a breath stir the grove,</br>Shou'd a rustle but faint catch my ear,</br>How fondly I've thought 'twas my love!</br>How sincerely I've wish'd might be her!", "When she sung in a pastoral strain,</br>Each shepherd wou'd lay down his flute;</br>While sweetly re-eccoed the plain</br>With the music of Phillis's throat:</br>The birds caroll'd blithe on the spray,</br>To rival my Phillis's tune;</br>And they thought, for so sweet was her lay,</br>It was Philomel singing at noon.", "But who'd think she so faithless cou'd prove;</br>When once as we sat on the plain,</br>While the birds in the neigh'bring grove,</br>With their melody heighten'd the scene!</br>Near by was a pair of fond doves,</br>Who were cooing their bliss in a bow'r,</br>When she said, with a smile, that their loves,</br>Were never so mutual as ours.", "Alas!  then my Phillis was kind,</br>And now as unkind she does prove;</br>But I'll chase her sweet form from my mind,</br>And I'll pluck up the roots of my love:</br>But shou'd she with smiles meet my sight,</br>And with her fond sweetness appear,</br>I shou'd think her, as once &mdash; my delight,</br>And, as once, I shou'd think her sincere.", "Ah!  no, she's not destin'd for me,</br>For alas!  she her vows hath forsworn,</br>And a heart that is once gone astray,</br>Will never, ah!  never return:</br>Then straight the dear plain I will fly,</br>Nor near the fair trait'ress dwell;</br>My pipe, dog, and shepherds, good by'e,</br>Flocks, cottage, and Phillis, farewell.</br>"]
