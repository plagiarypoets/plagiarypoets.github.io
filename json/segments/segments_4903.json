["GENIUS of the desert wild,</br>NATURE'S misanthropic child!</br>'Tis within yon hermit cell</br>SOLITUDE, thou lov'st to dwell,</br>Or, with fairy feet to dance</br>O'er the clifted height's expanse,</br>Or, in the lonesome vale to stray</br>And trim the lamp of life away!", "Hence NOISE and FOLLY, idle brood,</br>Fly, fly the haunts of SOLITUDE.</br>Shrouded in the dumb retreat</br>Muffled SILENCE takes her set,</br>And MELANCHOLY droops her head,</br>And sighs and weeps till HOPE is fled:</br>While pious SUPPLICATION stands</br>With asking eye and lifted hands,</br>And MEM'RY grasps in chequer'd ray</br>The fleeting forms of YESTERDAY!", "WEALTH, in purple vest array'd,</br>And MODESTY, that courts the shade;</br>TRUTH, disdaining puff'd pretence,</br>Meek unconscious INNOCENCE;</br>TRANQUILLITY, unknown to CARE,</br>Fairest where all forms are fair;</br>And sweet CONTENT, that's blest to roam</br>Never from her native home;</br>SOLITUDE!  thy charms supply</br>And tune the Soul to HARMONY!", "For Thee, when PHOSPHOR'S purple beam</br>Plays upon the chrystal stream;</br>When the ZEPHYRS silky sway</br>Chills the fervid heat of day;</br>When wrapt in EVENING'S gloomy damp</br>The little Glow-Worm lights her lamp,</br>Or TWILIGHT'S herald, bird of care,</br>Flits beneath the lucid air,</br>And sickly tapers shed their light</br>Along the misty veil of NIGHT,</br>SOLITUDE!  for thee I sigh,</br>For Thou art best society!", "With thee, from RIOT'S revel reign,</br>From PLEASURE'S pantomimic train,</br>From GLORY'S prostituted palm,</br>I seek the philosophic calm;</br>Whether to track Caucasian snow,</br>Or in the torrid Tropic glow,</br>To mark the circling Ocean's bound,</br>Or trace a streamlet by its sound.", "O!  might the hours of musing stay!</br>Or fly, as they have fled to-day:</br>Now LEARNING'S sacred heaps I'd tread</br>In converse with the mighty dead;</br>Now rove the silent walls among,</br>Where torrents flow'd from TULLY'S tongue;</br>Or tow'rd Vesuvius' summit turn</br>To drop a tear on PLINY'S urn;</br>And, as the tell-tale moments fly,</br>Ponder on Immortality!</br>"]
