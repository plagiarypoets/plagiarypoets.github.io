["An others came. &mdash; Desires and Adorations,</br>Wing'd Persuasions, and veil'd Destinies,</br>Splendours, and Glooms, and glimmering Incantations</br>Of hopes and fears, and twilight Phantasies;</br>And Sorrow, with her family of Sighs;</br>And Pleasure, blind with tears, led by the gleam</br>Of her own dying smile instead of eyes!", "ELEGY</br>Weep for my Tomcat!  all ye Tabbies weep,</br>For he is gone at last!  Not dead alone,</br>In flowery beauty sleepeth he no sleep;</br>Like that bewitching youth Endymion!</br>My love is dead, alas, as any stone,</br>That by some violet-clad smiling river</br>Weepeth too fondly!  He is dead and gone,</br>And fair Aurora, o'er her young believer,</br>With fingers gloved with roses, doth make moan,</br>And every bud its petal green doth sever,</br>And Phoebus sets in night for ever, and for ever!</br>And others come!  ye Splendours!  and ye Beauties!</br>Ye Raptures  with your robes of pearl and blue;</br>Ye blushing Wonders!  with your scarlet shoe-ties;</br>Ye Horrors bold!  with breasts of lily hue;</br>Ye Hope's stern flatterers!  He would trust to you,</br>Whene'er he saw you with your chestnut hair,</br>Dropping sad daffodils; and rosepinks true!</br>Ye Passions proud!  with lips of bright despair;</br>Ye Sympathies!  with eyes like evening star,</br>When on the glowing east she rolls her crimson car.", "Oh, bard-like spirit!  beautiful and swift!</br>Sweet lover of pale night; when Luna's lamp</br>Shakes sapphire dew-drops through a cloudy rift;</br>Purple as woman's mouth, o'er ocean damp;</br>Thy quivering rose-tinged tongue &mdash; thy stealing tramp;</br>The dazzling glory of thy gold-tinged tail;</br>Thy whisker-waving lips, as o'er the swamp</br>Rises the meteor, when the year doth fail,</br>Like beauty in decay, all, all are flat and stale.</br>"]
