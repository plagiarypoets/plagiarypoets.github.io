["Enough, now my PHILLIS is kind as she's fair,</br>And no Shepherdess fairer can be;</br>Take, take O ye winds DAMON'S burthen of care,</br>For no Villager's happy as he.", "Reclin'd by some rill, whilst our lambs are at play,</br>For my pipe we soft sonnets compose;</br>Each ev'ning recount all the pleasures of day,</br>And retire with our flocks to repose.", "Our straw-roofed cot with no grandeur abounds,</br>Yet CONTENTMENT'S there pleased to reside,</br>The casement a curling sweet woodbine surrounds,</br>Which was planted and nurs'd by my bride.", "A wreath she entwin'd, and fixed on my brows,</br>'Tother day in an eglantine grove;</br>Saying, \"This my fond Swain's a reward for thy vows,</br>And a token of conjugal love.\"", "While CONSTANCY lives, THIS, uninjur'd by Time,</br>Shall declare thee the pride of the plain,</br>Eternize thy name in eulogies sublime,</br>By the title, THE FAITHFULLEST SWAIN.", "Such kindness I thus will, ye Shepherds, repay,</br>With a mantle of beautiful green;</br>A primrosy garland to hail the new May,</br>And denote her, the PASTORAL QUEEN.</br>"]
