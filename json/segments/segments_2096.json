["O never-sated grave!  in whose embrace</br>Is hid forever from my joyless sight,</br>That peerless form, that love-illumined face,</br>Whose witchery charm'd each demon-woe to flight,</br>And in adversity's most starless night,</br>Streamed morning radiance o'er my cherish'd soul;</br>Nerving its powers, with more than human.  might,</br>Swaying its movements all with mild controul,&mdash;</br>My paradise her arms, &mdash; her heart my spirit's goal.", "Thy spoil I grudge thee, grave! &mdash; and thee, oh Heaven!</br>Who, to add splendour to yon bright array,</br>From form divine, divinest spirit hast riven,</br>And greedily borne it to thy bowers away.</br>Ah!  me, full bliss is sorrow's earliest prey:</br>Surpassing glory, but foretells decline,</br>Night's sackcloth soon enshrouds the brightest day,</br>And fields, and flowers, their summer pomp resign,&mdash;</br>Change is the doom of all, save this fix'd heart of mine.", "And oh!  I envy you, &mdash; ye spirits pure,</br>Who in the blaze of Joy's eternal noon,</br>Where passion-mists, no darkling soul obscure,&mdash;</br>Know all the sweets of intellectual boon,</br>And to love's mellow themes your souls attune,</br>I envy you the luxury refined,</br>The nectar of her converse; &mdash; why so soon</br>To me this balm denied?  oh fates unkind!</br>Was it too much to grant, &mdash; too much for man to find?", "And why, remorseless tyrant!  all-abhorr'd,</br>Whose breath sheds mildew o'er creations bloom,</br>Blasting alike the adorer, and the adored,</br>And quenching beauty's light in envious gloom;</br>Why must I writhe beneath thy heaviest doom?</br>Thy dreadest destiny, relentless death!</br>Why sepulchre my life in Laura's tomb,</br>And leave me sense enough, and vital breath</br>To know thy skinny arms her matchless form enwreath.</br>"]
