["Whoe'er thou art, that lov'st the barbarous rhyme,</br>The festive march, and no unpleasing tone</br>Of uncouth minstrel-songs i' th' olden time,</br>Attuned to harps in raptures all their own;</br>Here bend thy rede awhile, nor rudely spurn</br>This transitory page, ne'er doomed to life eterne.", "Oh might I gain one dribbet of their sprite,</br>As all inglorious on the peaceful shore,</br>I mark the forms Pierian, orders bright,</br>And scan with reverence their mysterious lore;</br>Or trace the motley scenes of comic life,</br>Each magic hue that blends in ever-varying strife.", "In vain I call:  stern unrelenting fate</br>Knows not the voice of mortal wight on ground:</br>No more. &mdash; Then hasten to th' ideal gate,</br>And tread with me the blythe Elysian round;</br>For lo!  on high, while Momus rules the hour,</br>The Samosatian star beams with ascendant power.", "Thus may these notes of well-attemper'd mirth</br>Responsive vibrate to the frolic string:</br>Untouch'd each honour'd name of living worth:</br>Minos shall nod; while on excursive wing,</br>Waving the potent branch, serenely gay,</br>Pass we the realms of light and drink their golden day.</br>"]
