["Cajol'd by oily speeches, and so forth,</br>I once was weak enough to stoop for fame,</br>To a small JUNTO; low, without a name,</br>Hating the Muses and ingenuous worth,</br>Apollo frowning on each Asses birth.</br>Proceed, gray Babes!  let Verse be still your game,</br>Scout it as worst of libels on your shame,</br>And, what Ye can, extirpate it from earth.</br>Mistake me not!  think Ye that I repine</br>Whilst Spenser, Milton, Cowley, Mason, Gray,</br>And Matchless Dryden, High-priest of the Nine,</br>Did each full oft experience in their day,</br>How vain the task their long-ear'd Judges to refine,</br>Tho' Orpheus old had tun'd the moving lay!</br>"]
