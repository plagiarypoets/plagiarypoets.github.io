["And well, O Milton!  is thine honour'd bust</br>Placed these deep shades and twilight glooms among;</br>For, though far off repose the Poet's dust,</br>Here lingers still the spirit of his song:</br>And oft, at eve, these high arcades along,</br>To Fancy's dreaming eye his form will glide;</br>While ev'n the depth of stillness finds a tongue,</br>And sounds unearthly float upon the tide,</br>Or in faint murmurs die along the dark hill-side.", "Yet why, O why, in such a scene is mute</br>The lyre, which scorns the touch of mortal hand&mdash;</br>The lyre of Heaven &mdash; the wandering Ariel's lute,</br>Which fairy fingers all alone have spann'd,</br>And the pure Zephyr's waving breath hath fann'd?</br>'Twere sweet to catch its tones when, still and dim,</br>The beauty-breathing hues of eve expand;</br>When day's last roses fade on ocean's brim,</br>And Nature veils her brow, and chaunts her vesper hymn.", "Sweet were that sound, at night, to many a band</br>That beats, with printless steps, the glimmering wave;</br>Sweetly 'twould linger o'er the moonlight sand,</br>To him, who loves to tread where waters lave,</br>And dream of that, which spurns the peaceful grave;</br>And sweetly would it fill the pauses deep,</br>When Autumn night-winds cease awhile to rave,</br>Or in low moanings hush themselves to sleep,</br>While listening woods and waves a holy concord keep.</br>"]
