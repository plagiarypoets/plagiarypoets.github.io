["Me thought I saw the Grave where Laura lay,</br>Within that Temple, where the Vestal Flame</br>Was wont to burn; and passing by that way,</br>To see that bury'd Dust of living Fame,</br>Whose Tomb fair Love, and fairer Vertue kept,</br>All suddenly I saw the Fairy-Queen:</br>At whose Approach, the Soul of Petrarch wept,</br>And from thenceforth those Graces were not seen.</br>For they this Queen attended; in whose steed</br>Oblivion laid him down on Laura's Herse:</br>Hereat the hardest Stones were seen to bleed,</br>And Grones of buried Ghosts the Heavens did perse.</br>Where Homer's Spright did tremble all for Grief,</br>And curst th' access of that celestial Thief.</br>"]
