["Morpheus, balmy god of sleep,</br>Softly o'er my senses creep,</br>Gently steal my heart from care;</br>Shed, O shed, thy poppies here;</br>Come, O come, and with thee bring,</br>Odours dropping from thy wing.</br>Come, and with thy blessings crown'd,</br>Wave thy dewy wand around;</br>Dipt in HYBLA'S rosy bed,</br>Wave it o'er my slumb'ring head:</br>Still, as SILENCE, let me lie,</br>Still, as summer breezes fly.", "Softly beat, ye springs of life:</br>Cease, ah cease your busy strife;</br>See the silent god descends,</br>O'er the world his reign extends:</br>See him spread his peaceful sway,</br>See all nature him obey.", "Calm inspire my golden dreams,</br>Calmer than the dimpled streams:</br>Bind my eyes with silken strings,</br>What is all the pomp of kings?</br>Downy god, in peace with you,</br>Let me bid the world adieu.</br>"]
