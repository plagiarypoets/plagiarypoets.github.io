["Amintor, how can'st thou refuse</br>To grant me so small a request;</br>Why urge you the want of Pope's muse,</br>Or the Doctor's poetical zest?</br>I vow tho' their numbers are sweet</br>And every sentence divine;</br>Tho' their value I reckon so great,</br>No less would I set upon thine.", "Would'st thou sing of the plain or the grove,</br>Or lament some unfortunate maid,</br>The Muses, fair daughters of Jove,</br>With raptures would readily aid.</br>What tho' they at first may seem coy,</br>'Tis but to be closer pursu'd;</br>They like like other nymphs will comply</br>When once they are heartily woo'd.", "Will nought thy ambition suffice,</br>But the laurel thy temples to grace?</br>If still thou resolve to despise</br>All but the superlative place:</br>Yet think how the critics in town</br>Misjudge of poetical fire;</br>From the skies shou'd Apollo come down,</br>They'd carp at his heavenly lyre.", "If the blind Grecian poet they praise,</br>'Tis to shew you their skill in the tongue,</br>Despising Pope's beautiful lays,</br>And swearing his version is wrong:</br>But had not that bard of renown,</br>Their ignorance deign'd to inform,</br>Of Homer no more they'd have known,</br>Than if he had never been born.", "For me, I disdain to regard</br>What these trifling censurers say;</br>If such are denied their reward,</br>Hope I to speed better than they?</br>Let my friends but approve of my strains,</br>Vouchsafing a smile on my song;</br>Then I'm overpaid for my pains,</br>Nor value an ill-natur'd tongue.</br>"]
