["Now, that Reality, of late so fair</br>In blossom'd pride of ev'ry lovely die;</br>Stript by the bitter blasts of worldly care,</br>Presents a cheerless prospect to mine eye;</br>It's scenes I quit, and seek a friendlier sky:</br>As the gay children of the gaudy spring,</br>The tender swallows, when our winter's nigh,</br>To southern seats their wonted musick bring;</br>So Fancy's fairy realm I seek on vent'rous wing.", "Beyond the world, but on the world's confine,</br>Far in the lucid south (still undescried</br>By vulgar eyes) is laid this Land divine;</br>With all on earth that's lovely beautified:</br>And sweets innum'rous to our world deny'd.</br>Yet far it's secret worth transcends it's show,</br>For in each blooming flow'r is close imply'd,</br>Instruction sage, and latent on each bow,</br>The fruits of golden Truth, and goodliest Knowledge grow.", "Now in this moral garden of the Muse,</br>(Where sacred Wisdom's not asham'd to rove,</br>But with it's fragrant blooms doth often chuse,</br>To deck the brow of Virtue, his fair love.)</br>Will I some gay delightful moments prove:</br>And as I've vow'd, if on aught fair I light,</br>Blossom, or fruit, thro' out it's wand'ring grove,</br>To her as virtue pure, and fancy bright,</br>My loveliest Clarabel!  I'll dedicate aright.", "Then ask I not the Muse my breast t' inspire;</br>But thou, my best, divinest Clarabel!</br>Bend here those eyes so fraught with sacred fire:</br>Thine eyes shall far surpass the Muse's well.</br>Pride of my song!  inspirer of my shell!</br>Thine is each song, each excellence they paint!</br>From thee at first the fair reflections fell;</br>Thus like a broken mirror they present,</br>Thy image multiplied, in colours true tho' faint.", "Ah!  then, dear maid, whene'er my soul declines,</br>Do thou look forth and re-illume its pow'rs;</br>As the fair moon on nightly pilgrim shines;</br>Or as an Angel from the celestial bow'rs,</br>Visits a Saint in weak distracted hours:</br>So shall my Fancy, cherish'd by my love,</br>(Unaw'd thro' want of learning's sacred stores,)</br>To the bright goal of thy approvance move,</br>And in thy smiles rejoice, all worldly meeds above.</br>"]
