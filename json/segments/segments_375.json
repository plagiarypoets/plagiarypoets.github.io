["Methinks Heroick Poesie, till now</br>Like some fantastick Fairy land did show;</br>Gods, Devils, Nymphs, Witches, and Giants race,</br>And all but man, in mans best work had place.</br>Thou like some worthy Knight, with sacred Arms</br>Dost drive the Monsters thence, and end the Charms:</br>In stead of those, dost Men and Manners plant,</br>The things which that rich soyl did chiefly want.</br>But even thy Mortals doe their Gods excell,</br>Taught by the Muse to Fight and Love so well.", "By fatall hands whilst present Empires fall,</br>Thine from the grave past Monarchies recall.</br>So much more thanks from humane kinde does merit</br>The Poets Fury, then the Zelots Spirit.</br>And from the grave thou mak'st this Empire rise,</br>Not like some dreadfull Ghost t' affright our Eyes,</br>But with more beauty and triumphant state,</br>Then when it crown'd at proud Verona sate.</br>So will our God re-build Mans perish'd frame,</br>And raise him up much better, yet the same:</br>So God-like Poets doe past things rehearse,</br>Not change, but heighten Nature with their Verse.", "With shame me thinks great Italy must see</br>Her Conqu'rors call'd to life again by thee;</br>Call'd by such powerfull Arts, that ancient Rome</br>May blush no less to see her Wit o'rcome.</br>Some men their Fancies like their Faiths derive;</br>And count all ill but but that which Rome does give;</br>The marks of Old and Catholick would finde;</br>To the same Chair would Truth and Fiction binde.</br>Thou in these beaten paths disdain'st to tread,</br>And scorn'st to Live by robbing of the Dead.</br>Since Time does all things change, thou thinkst not fit</br>This latter Age should see all new, but Wit.</br>Thy Fancy, like a Flame, her way does make;</br>And leaves bright tracks for following Pens to take.</br>Sure 'twas this noble boldness of the Muse</br>Did thy desire to seek new Worlds infuse;</br>And ne'r did Heaven so much a Voyage bless,</br>If thou canst Plant but there with like success.</br>"]
