["Comes there not gladness in the festal wind,</br>From the far chambers of the sapphire west,&mdash;</br>Whose chainless wanderings, pure and unconfined,</br>Pour unseen freshness o'er the green earth's breast?</br>Sweetly the rose leaf startles from its rest,</br>As the faint whispers wander fleetly by,</br>How like gay childhood, by some vision blest,</br>When the pure soul is buoyant as the sky,</br>And the bright sun of peace outpours its light on high!", "Song thrills amidst the grove; there matin birds</br>Pour their rapt melodies on glancing wing,</br>Sweet as the accent of pure childhood words,</br>When the young spirit revels in its spring:</br>O, do long after years such transport bring</br>As the frail ecstacies which youth invest:</br>May the sun smile as bright, or wild birds sing</br>Such winning music for the joyous breast,</br>As in that early dawn, by sadness unoppress'd!", "Oh, viewless wind!  passing o'er stream and flower;</br>Gathering rich incense on thy hastening wing;</br>What a sweet murmurer of life's morning hour;</br>The dawning splendors of its golden spring!</br>Thou bearest the wood birds' voice; the strains they sing</br>Come, as a rill's sweet prattling to my ear;</br>How my soul turns to clasp the dreams they bring!</br>Alas!  they wither as the waning year;</br>Oh, fragrant wind of earth, why art thou lingering here?</br>"]
