["In Aesop's days, when trees cou'd speak,</br>And talk in Hebrew, Latin, Greek,</br>An Elm and Vine, by chance near neighbours:</br>Tho' separate, each pursued their labours,</br>The Vine, with native sweetness fraught,</br>For man prepar'd the cheering draught;</br>Her tendrils curl'd along the plain,</br>And ruddy clusters swell'd amain.</br>The tow'ring Elm could little boast,</br>But leaves &mdash; a barren shade at most;</br>Save when by Woodman's sturdy stroke</br>Cut down to make a chair, or spoke,</br>Yet tho' but small his claim to merit,</br>Not wholly void of sense or spirit.</br>His neighbour's worth he view'd with smiles,</br>And long'd to share her useful toils.", "For, \"O!  said he, were we but one,</br>Sure bliss would center here alone.</br>For I by you encircled high,</br>Should scorn the Oak's proud majesty,</br>While your rich fruit time might mature</br>From storms and savage beasts secure;</br>Our mutual help would soothe our care,</br>And heav'n approve the happy pair.\"", "\"Forbear, sir Elm, the Vine reply'd,</br>Nor wonder if your suit's deny'd.</br>Shall I give up my independence,</br>On your caprice to dance attendance?</br>Must I, or nod, or bend, or twine,</br>Just as your worship shall incline?</br>Or shall my charms, which all admire,</br>Become a barren tree's attire?</br>No &mdash; seek more suitable alliance&mdash;</br>I to all danger bid defiance.</br>Here, unconfin'd, I range my fill;</br>And bounteous Nature waits my will.\"", "At this the modest Elm struck mute,</br>Forbore to urge his friendly suit.</br>But, sorely griev'd to meet disdain,</br>A tender sigh express'd his pain.", "When, lo!  thick darkness veils the pole,</br>Dread lightnings flash, loud thunders roll;</br>Impetuous rains in floods descend,</br>And trembling nature fears an end.</br>The vine, faint, spiritless, forlorn,</br>Now seeks the succour late her scorn:</br>Creeps feebly to the Elms embrace;</br>And in his arms finds sweet solace;</br>United thus they storms defy,</br>And mutual grace and aid supply.</br>"]
