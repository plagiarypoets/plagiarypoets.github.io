["In deep oblivion's dreary gloom</br>A magic name at rest is laid;</br>The ruthless rigours of the tomb</br>But half conceals the stately shade.", "What, if the Muses earth-born name</br>To blazing Fame has been deny'd,</br>In Merit's unabating claim</br>The loss is more than half supply'd.", "Perhaps Misfortune, in his youth,</br>His glowing virtues might assail,</br>Or o'er the half-rais'd shield of Truth</br>The points of Envy might prevail.", "Or to his rude untutor'd lays</br>Untimely grand, sublimely wild,</br>Mute was the voice of Public Praise,</br>Which made him more Misfortune's child.", "Perhaps remote from hall or bower</br>He wore his pensive hours alone.</br>Where Dulness lavish'd all her pow'r,</br>And died unhonour'd and unknown.", "But now from vulgar sight debarr'd,</br>Genii select, his ashes keep,</br>Their spears transfix'd, their bound'ries guard,</br>Whilst o'er his grass-green sod they weep.", "Yet know, lost Bard of partial fame,</br>Such flames thy numbers still inspire,</br>Our village youth oft ask thy name,</br>And of thy story too enquire.", "And brave as in thy forceful lay,</br>Fair England's boast and Scotia's pride,</br>Now heap with slain th' embattled way,</br>'Gainst Gallia fighting side by side.", "And down the live-long stream of time,</br>Thy artless theme shall e'er be sung,</br>Throughout fair Albion's happy clime,</br>In moving strain, by many a tongue.</br>"]
