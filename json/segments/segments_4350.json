["When Conway's surge with horrid roar,</br>Had whelm'd the Druid's tresses hoar,</br>Hovering o'er the haunted flood,</br>The Genius of the sacred wood,</br>High the dripping mantle shook,</br>And floating lyre uplifted took,</br>Where bards immortal, mid the tuneful spheres,</br>Chant to Heroick shades the songs of elder years.", "\"Mantle, erst by Merlin given,</br>Dipt in rainbow tints of Heaven,</br>Fraught with many a wizard spell,</br>Mortal language dare not tell;</br>Spells that human hearts control,</br>Awe the sense and melt the soul;</br>At Terrour's voice bid Health's bright rubies fly,</br>Or gem with pearls divine soft Pity's angel eye.", "\"Relick of the awful Seer,</br>Wond'rous key of Joy and Fear;</br>Who can boast a kindred spirit?</br>Who thy magick power inherit?</br>What child of Earth shall now aspire</br>To touch the doom-denouncing lyre?\"</br>The Minstrel Choir in mute attention hung,</br>Whilst to his airy harp thus Taliessin sung:", "\"Bear them from that fatal shore,</br>(Mona's melody is o'er)</br>To the Nymph of fairy song,</br>Caledonia's groves among,</br>Bid her build the lofty rhyme;</br>Bid her raise the hymn sublime,</br>Fit for the King of Bards in days of yore;</br>Fit for the mighty Lord of legendary lore.\"", "Worthy of the high command,</br>Hark!  the Virgin's potent hand</br>Strikes the chords of pain and pleasure,</br>In a sweetly-varied measure;</br>She with Pythick ardour firing,</br>Felt within the God inspiring;</br>And whilst the shell resounded PERCY'S praise,</br>We heard the heaven-born strains of Arthur's golden days.</br>"]
