["Thin and worn out!  alas, my poor old Shoes!</br>My old companions!  fellow-travellers</br>In many an up-hill, down-hill, dirty road!</br>Gone past all patching!  gone beyond the reach</br>Of cobler, shoe apothecary's skill,</br>Or graduate master of the gentle craft.</br>State quacks or patent pills as soon might save</br>A rotten constitution.  There ye lie,</br>Divorc'd, alas!  for ever from the feet,</br>That late ye fitted well!  Mute monitors&mdash;</br>Texts to a mournful sermon &mdash; there ye lie,</br>The victims of that universal lot</br>All things must one day share &mdash; kingdoms and thrones,</br>And pyramids, yea, haply, earth herself,</br>Like all her offspring for destruction fram'd.</br>True that, regardless of all shape and size,</br>In utter absolute contempt of toes,</br>Tap'ring to narrow point, pyramidal,</br>Your maker fram'd you; tort'ring grievously</br>The fingers of the feet, that lay comprest,</br>Crowded, and crushing close as a human cargo,</br>Bound for the Sugar Isles; and kibes and corns</br>Ensued.  Yet soon accustom'd, lay they pack'd,</br>And prest, insensible, so true it is</br>Custom is second nature.", "But it seems</br>The weathercock of fashion has veer'd round,</br>And theoretical Shoemakers preach</br>New doctrines &mdash; that the principle of Shoes,</br>Mistaken, or perverted, many an age,</br>Now first are understood; so right and left,</br>Forsooth, they fit them to the nat'ral shape&mdash;</br>Gradual reformers!", "Must I try their plans?</br>Submit to innovation, and renounce</br>Old custom, for new theories?  And yet</br>Something must needs be done.  It boots not now</br>To piece and patch; no botching profits aught;</br>The old supports are gone; the stamina</br>Worn out; the sole destroyed!</br>"]
