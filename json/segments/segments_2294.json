["Ye Shepherds who sport on the plain,</br>Drop a tear at my sorrowful tale,</br>My heart was a stranger to pain,</br>Till pierc'd by the pride of the vale.</br>When deck'd with his pipe and his crook,</br>A garland his temples did bind,</br>So sweetly the Shepherd did look,</br>I thought he cou'd not be unkind.", "But alas!  t' other day at the fair,</br>(Sad story for me to relate,)</br>He bought ribbons for Phillis's hair,</br>For Phillis, the nymph that I hate.</br>Sweet songs to beguile the dull hours,</br>A crook, and a garland so fine,</br>A posie of May-blowing flowers,</br>Adorn'd with green myrtle and thyme.", "Last week as they sat in the grove,</br>Such sweetness his looks did impart,</br>Their converse I'm sure was of love,</br>And I fear, that it flow'd from his heart.</br>I heard the soft words that he sung,</br>Such tender, such amorous lays,</br>Each accent that fell from his tongue,</br>Was blended with Phillis's praise.", "\"My charmer, said he, is more fair,</br>Then the jessamine twin'd round my bow'r,</br>What's thyme with her breath to compare,</br>Or lavender after a show'r.</br>The rose when compar'd with her cheek,</br>Drooping downward with envy it dies,</br>When Sol thro' a shower doth break&mdash;</br>He's not half so bright as her eyes.\"", "Alas!  if they never had met,</br>I had not endur'd such keen woes,</br>I wish he would Phillis forget,</br>And yield my poor heart some repose.</br>Each day wou'd I sing thro' the grove,</br>Each moment devote to my swain.</br>But if he has settled his love,</br>My bosom is destin'd to pain.", "Adieu, to contentment and rest,</br>Adieu, to my once lov'd repose,</br>For I fear I can never be bless'd,</br>Till death puts an end to my woes.</br>To the grave will I carry my truth,</br>Take heed ah!  ye nymphs by my fate,</br>Be careful to shun the false youth,</br>And with pity my story relate.</br>"]
