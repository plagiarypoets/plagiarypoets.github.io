["Tho' all nations to arms now arise,</br>And Anarchy falls to the ground;</br>When lingering Royalty dies,</br>Ambition receives her death wound.</br>Tho' terrors now shake the whole earth,</br>They glide o'er a mortal like me;</br>I'll bless the kind stars of my birth,</br>That left me contented and Free.", "I have but a little in store,</br>I ne'er plagu'd my soul with much wealth;</br>I'd rather be temperate and poor,</br>Than lessen the Rock of my health.</br>What signifies that strong debate</br>That seems right or wrong unto me?</br>I gave up such cares to the state,</br>Whilst I live contented and Free.", "I rise to my labours at dawn,</br>I breathe the sweet balm of the spring,</br>And when o'er the dew-sprinkl'd lawn</br>I hear the sweet choristers sing;</br>How pleasing responsive the vale,</br>How happy such tidings to me,</br>While harmony waits on the gale,</br>And tells I'm contented and Free!", "When Sol on his chariot elate</br>Expands the meridian of day,</br>My oxen from toil I abate,</br>And o'er the fresh fallow they stray.</br>They ne'er at their labours repine,</br>Since labour for living must be,</br>They follow that precept of mine,</br>And ramble contented, when Free.", "At eve, when the dew drops descend,</br>I make the sweet swarms all my care;</br>My bees in their hives I defend,</br>And shelter them from the chill air;</br>With harmonious hum they retire,</br>Such gratitude rests in the bee,</br>And when on fresh sweets they aspire,</br>They fly out contented and Free.", "Scarce finish'd, I suddenly hear</br>A sound on the gentle breeze spread,</br>'Tis DELIA surprises my ear,</br>And tells me her flocks are all fed.</br>Thrice welcome my DELIA I've prest,</br>And told her how welcome to me,</br>In love we'll live mutually blest,</br>Both happy, contented, and Free.</br>"]
