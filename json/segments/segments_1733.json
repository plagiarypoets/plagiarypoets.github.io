["Tell me who'll paint the feelings of a bard?</br>Who can direct the poet's wondrous brain,</br>And show its burnings?  'Twere a task right hard,</br>Methinks, as he o'er hill and verdant plain,</br>Or through the boundless skies or rocking main,</br>Lets loose, on Fancy's wing, his wand'ring thought:</br>Oh!  I could name a bard who aye hath wrought</br>His verse to ecstacy, whate'er he drew:</br>Who'll paint the ecstacy from which those raptures flew?", "Now strong as Fate &mdash; now weaker than a child;</br>Now sore deprest, or burning with delight;</br>Now swardy plains he roves, or deserts wild,</br>Or skins beneath the glooms of darkest night;</br>And now again he bursts to joy and light!&mdash;</br>His brain!  and oh its bursting tenement!</br>With throbbing wild I ween are often rent.</br>His reason &mdash; ah!  a hair around them wrapt</br>Would be as strong, for 'tis continually snapt.", "Soars he!  Full oft ten thousand miles above,</br>Roaming luxuriantly the golden skies,</br>Where all around is heavenly peace and love.</br>Ten thousand endless clouds of perfume rise,</br>Ten thousand angels dance before his eyes!</br>Till, laden much, away to earth he wings</br>His course, and paints his bright imaginings;</br>And ah!  how faint, how very faint I ken</br>The full Miltonian numbers roll out from his pen.", "Dives he!  Unnumber'd fathoms under ground,</br>Swift thro' the caverns of the ocean's bed;</br>Perchance where hissing snakes and devils bound</br>Athwart his footpath wheresoe'er he'll tread,</br>Paving his road or flopping o'er his head,&mdash;</br>Where bells ten thousand crowd his magic thought</br>He writes &mdash; his pen some glimm'ring of't hath caught;</br>Look, thro' his awful words the demons stare!</br>But oh!  nought's half so dark as is the dark ink there.", "Lean will he often o'er some up-shot root,</br>From whose bed trickles out a whisp'ring spring,</br>To mark the hawthorn or rude bramble shoot</br>Out their blossomings &mdash; or hear the linnet sing,</br>Or watch the tweedling lark upon her wing,</br>Speck-like above the woodland's topmost tree,</br>Topping the concert of its minstrelsy.</br>He wakes &mdash; lessens his raptures &mdash; do but see</br>His lines!  music!  the piping of an humble bee.", "Culls he the mottled garden, gaily wrapt</br>In, aye, of living gems one golden sheet?</br>Culls he the em'rald meadow all dedropt</br>With simple kingcup, bell, and daisy neat?</br>And eke the poppy from the saffron wheat?</br>He does &mdash; and as he pens them down, he strews</br>Each tint with drops of sweet Castalian dews.</br>You smell, as in dark rooms at close of day,</br>You smell the flowers, perchance, but see not the bouquet!", "And, if the blood of youth laughs thro' his veins,</br>He'll write of love &mdash; he'll tell ye how 'twill burn</br>Some luckless wight &mdash; and how triumphant reigns</br>It over man and beast &mdash; and how 'twill spurn</br>At life sometimes, and creep beneath an urn</br>O'erspread by some dark yew tree's solemn shade.</br>When all is done, the sorrow he hath made</br>Is but a drizzling mist his pen hath caught</br>Up from the ocean of his melancholy thought.", "'Tis ever thus; &mdash; upon whatever theme</br>He throws the splendour of his mind's bright sun,</br>Exhaling all that's meet, 'tis but a beam</br>Most faintly shot &mdash; the lazy words do run</br>So limpingly about whate'er is done.</br>O!  soul divine &mdash; O verse, thou ill fram'd thing;</br>Thou muddy oozing from a heavenly spring;</br>Thou wax of honey, and thou whey of milk:</br>Thou rude rough iron bars to weave a web of silk!</br>"]
