["Farewell thou dimpled cherub JOY,</br>Thou rose-crown'd, ever-smiling boy,</br>Wont thy sister HOPE to lead</br>To dance along the primrose mead!</br>No more, bereft of happy hours,</br>I seek thy lute-resounding bow'rs,</br>But to yon' ruin'd tower repair,</br>To meet the god of Groans, DESPAIR;</br>Who, on that ivy-darken'd ground,</br>Still takes at eve his silent round,</br>Or sits yon' new-made grave beside,</br>Where lies a frantic suicide:</br>While lab'ring sighs my heart-strings break,</br>Thus to the sullen power I speak:", "\"Haste with thy poison'd dagger, haste,</br>To pierce this sorrow-laden breast!</br>Or lead me at the dead of night,</br>To some sea-beat mountain's height,</br>Whence with headlong haste I'll leap</br>To the dark bosom of the deep;</br>Or shew me far from human eye,</br>Some cave to muse in, starve and die,</br>No weeping friend or brother near,</br>My last, fond, fault'ring words to hear!\"", "'Twas thus with weight of woes opprest,</br>I sought to ease my bruised breast;</br>When straight more gloomy grew the shade,</br>And lo!  a tall majestic maid!</br>Her limbs, not delicately fair,</br>Robust, and of a martial air;</br>She bore of steel a polish'd shield,</br>Where highly-sculptur'd I beheld</br>Th' Athenian martyr smiling stand,</br>The baleful goblet in his hand;</br>Sparkled her eyes with lively flame,</br>And PATIENCE was the Seraph's name;</br>Sternly she look'd, and stern began&mdash;</br>\"Thy sorrows cease, complaining man,</br>Rouze thy weak soul, appease thy moan,</br>Soon are the clouds of sadness gone;</br>Tho' now in Grief's dark groves you walk,</br>Where griesly fiends around you stalk,</br>Beyond, a blissful city lies,</br>Far from whose gates each anguish flies:</br>Take thou this shield, which once of yore</br>ULYSSES and ALCIDES wore,</br>And which in later days I gave</br>To REGULUS and RALEIGH brave,</br>In exile or in dungeon drear</br>Their mighty minds could banish fear;</br>Thy heart no tenfold woes shall feel,</br>'Twas VIRTUE temper'd the rough steel,</br>And, by her heavenly fingers wrought,</br>To me the precious present brought.\"</br>"]
