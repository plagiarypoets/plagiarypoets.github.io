["Wide spreading o'er the purpl'd east,</br>See where yon crimson ensign bends:</br>Prepare!  prepare!  th' ambrosial feast,</br>For lo!  the God of gods descends,</br>But how, O nature!  wilt thou bear the load,</br>Or meet the splendours of a coming God?</br>In vain I ask &mdash; for now yon parting sky</br>Proclaims th' eternal triumph nigh:</br>Stand fast, thou earth,</br>For since thy birth,</br>Thy stedfast pillars never bore</br>Th' intolerable weight of DEITY before.", "But hark! &mdash; methinks some softer strains,</br>Than ever shook th' eternal plains,</br>Since time began to roll,</br>Melts in mine ears,</br>Dispels my fears,</br>And sweeps away my soul.</br>'Tis Gabriel's voice, (I know the sound)</br>And mercy smiles to day;</br>Let angels shout!  let earth resound!</br>For God assumes our clay.", "And see!  in token of supernal grace,</br>The angry ensign disappears;</br>Ten thousand milder glories fill the space,</br>And music wakes the spheres:</br>Harmonious thro' the realms above</br>One gen'ral concert rings,</br>And all the burthen of the song is love,</br>Love!  braces all the strings.</br>Astonish'd angels view the scene,</br>And (curious) fain would know,</br>What all this world of wonders!  mean;</br>These mysteries below?&mdash;</br>In vain they pry &mdash; the boundless scheme, O!  man,</br>For thee!  was laid, 'ere time began:</br>For thee!  before all worlds were fram'd,</br>Or angels hymn'd th' eternal THREE,</br>The Council sat &mdash; the terms were nam'd,</br>And MERCY fix'd on Thee:", "And lo!  the period mark'd in heav'n&mdash;</br>The day that crowns Creation's birth</br>Is now arriv'd &mdash; the promis'd CHILD is given,</br>And GOD inhabits earth;</br>Angels applauding!  clap their golden wings,</br>While Bethlehem receives the King of Kings!</br>For this!  let rocks, and hills, and plains,</br>(Unpractis'd yet to vocal strains)</br>For once their silence break:</br>While man! &mdash; but man can never tell,</br>The grateful thoughts his breast should swell,</br>Nor half his raptures speak&mdash;</br>Silence, perhaps, may more expressive prove,</br>And heav'n accept the heart dissolv'd in love.</br>"]
