["How beautiful is night!</br>A dewy freshness fills the silent air;</br>No mist obscures, nor cloud, nor speck, nor stain,</br>Breaks the serene of heaven:</br>In full-orb'd glory yonder Moon divine</br>Rolls through the dark blue depths.</br>Beneath her steady ray</br>The desert-circle spreads,</br>Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky.</br>How beautiful is night!", "Who at this untimely hour</br>Wanders o'er the desert sands?</br>No station is in view,</br>Nor palm-grove, islanded amid the waste,</br>The mother and her child,</br>The widow'd mother and the fatherless boy,</br>They at this untimely hour</br>Wander o'er the desert sands.", "Alas!  the setting sun</br>Saw Zeinab in her bliss,</br>Hodeirah's wife beloved.</br>Alas!  the wife beloved,</br>The fruitful mother late,</br>Whom when the daughters of Arabia named,</br>They wish'd their lot like her's,</br>She wanders o'er the desert sands</br>A wretched widow now;</br>The fruitful mother of so fair a race,</br>With only one preserved,</br>She wanders o'er the wilderness.</br>"]
