Fields around,</br>And for their several Games chuse proper Ground.</br>Some fond of Conquest throw an Iron Wedge,</br>Some hurl huge Balls, some toss a Massy Sledge.</br>Some pond'rous Stones back o'er their Shoulders fling,</br>These Darts project, and those employ the Sling.</br>A Band of Archers here at Rovers shoot,</br>Another there wounds the high turfy Butt.</br>Some swift of Foot run Races o'er the Plain,</br>And eager of the Prize their Sinews strain.</br>Some pleas'd with Goff the Ball with Vigor strike,</br>These exercise the Colours, those the Pike.", "When Evening came, they pass'd the cheerful Night</br>In various Scenes of Triumph and Delight.</br>The Limbs of Trees, the Hills and Forrest's Spoils</br>For Fires of Joy stand thick in lofty Piles.</br>The Woods, which lent their Oaks to quell the Foe,</br>Furnish Materials for the Triumph now.</br>Surrounding Youth set the high Piles on Fire,</br>To Heav'n their Shouts, to Heav'n the Flames aspire.</br>Long live the Queen, the joyful Britons cry,</br>Long live the Queen, the ecchoing Spheres reply.</br>Bright Lights in order plac'd each House adorn,</br>The Day recover, and prevent the Morn.</br>Harmonious Bells which high in Turrets hung,</br>Thro' all the Town in tuneful Changes rung.</br>The Conduits with Immense Profusion play'd,</br>And high in Air Red Jets of Wine convey'd.</br>The Crowd their ample Bowls with Nectar crown'd,</br>And Loyal Healths with loud Applause went round.", "Before th' Imperial Palace tow'ring stood,</br>Rare Works of Fire encas'd in painted Wood.</br>Whence rival Glories did to Heav'n arise,</br>And Earth-born Thunder rung along the Skies.</br>The Heav'ns amaz'd with borrow'd Lustre shone,</br>With Lights and Meteors of a Race unknown,</br>With Forreign Stars, as thick and splendid as their own.</br>Such Noise, such Flames fill'd all the ambient Air,</br>The very Triumph seem'd another War,</br>And with the dreadful Joy did all the People scare.</br>Triumphant Laurels form'd of verdant Flame,</br>Advanc'd the Conqueror's and the Artist's Fame.</br>Nor did th' amaz'd Spectators less admire,</br>Th' Inscriptions writ in Characters of Fire.", "Britannia's Monarch at th' approach of Night</br>Did to a Treat magnificent invite</br>All the great Lords that on her Court did wait,</br>Her own, and Forreign Ministers of State.</br>Strong Servants panting with the pond'rous Feast,</br>And with unweildy Luxury opprest,</br>Brought mighty Dishes of delicious Fare,</br>And on the groaning Tables plac'd the Cheer.</br>All Beasts, that Britain's fertile Pastures breed,</br>That range the Parks, or on the Mountains feed.</br>All kinds of curious Fish, that Pleasure take</br>In the swift Stream, or in the standing Lake;</br>Which in our own, or distant Nations dwell,</br>With Scales adorn'd, or fortify'd with Shell.</br>All sorts of wild, or tame Domestick Fowl,</br>Which finer Tasts as choice Delights enrol,</br>With all the feather'd Pleasures of the Sky,</br>Which by the Net, and by the Faulcon die;</br>All kinds of rare and more luxurious Meat</br>Which Albion yields, and Forreign Nations eat,</br>The Guests with unexampled Plenty treat.</br>All sorts of gen'rous and delicious Juice,</br>Which cheer the drooping Heart, and Mirth produce,</br>The happy Growth of fair Britannia's Isle,</br>Of Europe's neighb'ring Realms, or distant Asia's Soil,</br>Regal'd the cheerful Guests, who all exprest</br>Great Admiration of the splendid Feast.", "And as their Taste was pleas'd with Wine and Cheer,</br>Consorts of Heav'nly Musick charm'd their Ear.</br>Yet all with more transporting Pleasure heard</br>Spencer the fam'd, unrival'd English Bard,</br>Who with a tuneful, and Seraphick Tongue,</br>Thus in a lofty Stile began his noble Song.", "Angels and Arms he sung, Coelestial Fight,</br>And dire Commotion in the Realms of Light.</br>He sung, how Satan with Ambition seiz'd,</br>In Heav'n uneasy, and in Bliss displeas'd,</br>With Lust of Independent Empire fir'd,</br>Against his Soveraign and his God conspir'd.</br>How he the Plan of his Rebellion laid,</br>Pretended Wrongs and Grievances display'd.</br>How he on Ruin set, in Mischief Wise,</br>Upbraided with inglorious Cowardise,</br>Seraphick Chiefs, who tamely did obey</br>Th' Almighty's hard Commands, and arbitrary Sway.</br>With his engaging Tongue, and subtile Art,</br>He of the Host seduc'd a mighty part,</br>Who flew to Arms, their Treason to assert.</br>He sung, how Satan on the fatal Day</br>Did his Battalions draw in bright Array,</br>Did on th' Aetherial Field unheard-of War display,</br>The Army, part the Azure Vally fills,</br>Part over-spread Heav'n's everlasting Hills.</br>The Rebel Host in Steel Immortal clad,</br>Advance th' Almighty's Empire to invade.", "He sung, how God by this Affront inflam'd,</br>Hung out his wrathful Flag, and War thro' Heav'n proclaim'd.</br>How faithful Michael rows'd with these Alarms,</br>Renown'd for Conduct, and Superior Arms,</br>The Chief to whom supream Command was giv'n</br>O'er all the glorious Regiments of Heav'n,</br>Drew from the Crystal Ars'nals of the Sky</br>Immortal Cannon, dread Artillery.</br>How he his Spear presaging Ruin shook,</br>What wrathful Majesty possess'd his Look.</br>With what a Port and formidable Air</br>The Seraph Chief did to the Field repair.</br>How he his bright embattel'd Myriads led,</br>To charge proud Satan at his Army's Head.</br>How Nature trembled, what Concern it show'd,</br>While raging Seraphs rang'd in Battel stood.</br>Here valiant Michael did his Host dispose,</br>And Orders gave how to assail the Foes.</br>There haughty Satan ready to engage,</br>In threat'ning Frowns express'd Immortal Rage.", "He sung, how first great Michael's Batt'ries plaid</br>From Heav'n's blue Hills, and vast Destruction made,</br>Chiefs heap'd on Chiefs, Cherub on Cherub laid.</br>How Satan shaking his distinguish'd Lance,</br>To be reveng'd, did to the Foe advance;</br>At Michael's Breast with his collected Strength,</br>Push'd his bright Spear of formidable Length.</br>Temper'd with Skill Divine th' Immortal Shield</br>Which Michael bore, could to no Weapon yield.</br>Satan enrag'd, repeats his Thrust in vain,</br>His Foes hard Arms all Hostile Force disdain,</br>Offenceless Seraphs feel no Wounds or Pain.</br>Then Michael couch'd his Adamantine Spear,</br>On Satan rush'd with such a fierce Career,</br>He threw him Headlong on the Heav'nly Ground,</br>And left within his Side a ghastly Wound.</br>A mighty Shout ran thro' the Loyal Host,</br>The flying Rebels yield the Battel lost.", "He sung, how thro' the Desarts of the Sky</br>The vanquish'd Host did in Confusion fly.</br>How the victorious Seraphs did pursue,</br>What Storms of Fire, what Thunderbolts they threw,</br>What Darts, what Light'nings at the Rebels flew.</br>What Rout, what Ruin, what Angelick Spoil,</br>Did where they pass'd, th' Aetherial Plains defile.</br>With what a Rage the Conqu'ring Warriors chast</br>The Rebel Seraphs thro' the Azure waste.</br>Until they stop'd on Heav'n's impending Brow;</br>Seas all beneath of flaming Sulphur flow.</br>How the lost Traytors in Disorder stood</br>On the high Banks of this amazing Flood:</br>Till Michael in his high Coelestial Car</br>Discharg'd new Vengeance, and reviv'd the War.</br>Who with his Terrors, and superior Might,</br>Push'd all their Squadrons from th' Aetherial Height</br>Into th' Infernal Lake, where all their Host</br>Plung'd deep in Flame remain for ever lost.", "Then sung the Bard, how still with Rage possest,</br>Satan expell'd from Heav'n did Earth infest.</br>How meditating Ruin, Spoil, and Blood,</br>He fir'd with Wrath, pursu'd the Just and Good.</br>Did with malicious Vigilance employ</br>A thousand Arts, the Righteous to destroy.</br>Did War foment, and impious Kings engage,</br>To lay them waste with unrelenting Rage.</br>How Satan prompted Aegypt's King to chase</br>With deadly Fury Jacob's Sacred Race.</br>How haughty Pharo with a mighty Force,</br>Chariots of Iron and unnumber'd Horse,</br>The trembling Hebrews in their Flight o'er-took,</br>And thro' their Tribes amazing Terror strook.</br>When God the yielding Ocean did divide,</br>And roll'd in heaps the Waves on either side.</br>When stiff'ning Waters heard the high Command,</br>Did Craggy Rocks, and Crystal Mountains stand,</br>And left an open Space of dry and naked Land.</br>When Pharo's Host advanc'd into the Sea,</br>And dar'd attempt the horrid Defile.</br>At the Almighty's Nod the Waters felt</br>Their Chain was broken, and began to melt.</br>What fear did Pharo seize, when first he saw</br>The Crystal Rocks dissolve, the Mountains thaw!</br>The must'ring Waves did on th' Aegyptian bear,</br>And charg'd their troubled Host with liquid War.</br>In vain th' Aegyptians from the Terror fly,</br>In vain to senseless Gods for Safety cry.</br>The roaring Sea their flying Army stops,</br>And whelms its Billows o'er their sinking Troops:</br>Does o'er their Horse and Horsemen roll its Flood,</br>And makes its Waters quench their Thirst of Blood.</br>Chariots and Armor sunk beneath the Tide,</br>Which bury'd in its Caves perfidious Pharo's Pride", "The wond'rous Bard proceeding chose to sing</br>The Wars of Deborah, and proud Caanan's King;</br>His Song advanc'd the wond'rous Woman's Name,</br>And next to hers, the mighty Barak's Fame:</br>Did in Sublime, Enthusiastick Verse,</br>Hers, and her valiant Gen'ral's Deeds rehearse:</br>The Wonders by their Arms near Kishon done,</br>What Valour there was shown, what Glory won.</br>How they, O Kishon, swell'd thy wond'ring Flood,</br>And drown'd the Fields around with Hostile Blood.</br>How Jabin's Troops flew from th' unequal Fight,</br>As Fear and Terror did direct their Flight.</br>How they to shun great Barak's Conqu'ring Sword,</br>Rashly, O Kishon, try'd thy Waves to Ford.</br>What Numbers on the Field of Battel dy'd,</br>What Numbers perish'd in the fatal Tide.", ""]
