["O thou, each Muse's dearest friend,</br>Pensive Solitude, attend;</br>With musing thought and stedfast eye,</br>All is peace when thou art nigh;</br>Parent of Meditation, hail!</br>O guide my steps to yonder vale;</br>Where nought disturbs the silent morn,</br>Save chirping birds on ev'ry dewy thorn.", "When first the cock's shrill clarion sounds,</br>Which Echo from her cave rebounds;</br>While yet the sons of toil are deep</br>Lull'd in the downy arms of Sleep;</br>Then lead me up the mountain's height,</br>To view the skies in azure dight,</br>And Phoebus' rising beams behold,</br>When first they tinge the orient clouds with gold.", "Or for a summer seat I'd take</br>The margin of yon chrystal lake;</br>Or with the winding current stray,</br>And see the finny nation play;</br>'Till fervent Noon, with scorching heat,</br>Bids to seek some cool retreat;</br>Then with thee I'd choose to rove</br>To shades impervious in the thickest grove.", "And when the radiant God of Day,</br>Declining, sheds a milder ray;</br>And with less dazzling glories crown'd,</br>Casts the length'ning shadows round;</br>Then the flow'ry fields invite,</br>With thee to walk in calm delight;</br>'Till by degrees each prospect fades,</br>Involv'd in sable Night's advancing shades.", "But see, the full-orb'd Moon appears,</br>Sublimely soaring 'mid the spheres;</br>And now the mind, with sacred flame,</br>Contemplates the starry frame:</br>As each new wonder she explores,</br>The great Creator's pow'r adores;</br>Admires o'er all his wise controul,</br>'Till heav'nly ecstacy enraps the soul.", "O Solitude!  thy vot'ry tell,</br>In what wild wood thou joy'st to dwell;</br>Amid the desarts thou art found,</br>Thy awful brows with cypress crown'd:</br>Through each quick-revolving day,</br>The Muse delights to own thy sway;</br>To thee, O thoughtful Nymph, belong</br>The pow'rs which animate her noblest song.</br>"]
