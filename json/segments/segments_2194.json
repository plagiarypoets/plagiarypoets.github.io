["Recite the loves of Narva and Mored,</br>The priest of Chalma's triple idol said.</br>High from the ground the youthful warriors sprung,</br>Loud on the concave shell the lances rung:</br>In all the mystic mazes of the dance,</br>The youths of Banny's burning sands advance.</br>Whilst the soft virgin panting looks behind,</br>And rides upon the pinions of of the wind:</br>Ascends the mountain's brow, and measures round</br>The steepy cliffs of Chalma's sacred ground.</br>Chalma, the God whose noisy thunders fly</br>Thro' the dark covering of the midnight sky.</br>Whose arm directs the close embattled host,</br>And sinks the lab'ring vessels on the coast.</br>Chalma, whose excellence is known from far;</br>From Lupa's rocky hill to Calabar.</br>The guardian God of Afric and the isles,</br>Where nature in her strongest vigor smiles;</br>Where the blue blossom of the forky thorn,</br>Bends with the nectar of the op'ning morn:</br>Where Gingers aromatic matted root,</br>Creep through the mead, and up the mountains shoot.", "Three times the virgin swimming on the breeze,</br>Danc'd in the shadow of the mystic trees:</br>When like a dark cloud spreading to the view,</br>The first-born sons of war and blood pursue;</br>Swift as the elk they pour along the plain;</br>Swift as the flying clouds distilling rain.</br>Swift as the boundings of the youthful roe,</br>They course around, and lengthen as they go.</br>Like the long chain of rocks, whose summits rise,</br>Far in the sacred regions of the skies;</br>Upon whose top the black'ning tempest lours,</br>Whilst down its side the gushing torrent pours.</br>Like the long cliffy moutnains which extend</br>From Lorbar's cave, to where the nations end,</br>Which sink in darkness, thick'ning and obscure,</br>Impenetrable, mystic and impure;</br>The flying terrors of the war advance,</br>And round the sacred oak repeat the dance.</br>Furious they twist aournd the gloomy trees,</br>Like leaves in autumn twirling with the breeze.</br>So when the splendor of the dying day,</br>Darts the red lustre of the watry way;</br>Sudden beneath Toddida's whistling brink,</br>The circling billows in wild eddies sink:</br>Whirl furious round and the loud bursting wave</br>Sink down to Chalma's sacerdotal cave:</br>Explore the palaces on Zira's coast,</br>Where howls the war song of the chieftain's ghost,</br>Where the artificer in realms below,</br>Gilds the rich lance, or beautifies the bow:</br>From the young palm tree spins the useful twine,</br>Or makes the teeth of elephants divine.</br>Where the pale children of the feeble sun,</br>In search of gold, thro' every climate run:</br>From burning heat, to freezing torments go,</br>And live in all vicissitudes of woe.</br>Like the loud eddies of Toddida's sea,</br>The warriors circle the mysterious tree:</br>Till spent with exercise, they spread around,</br>Upon the op'ning blossoms of the ground.</br>The priestess rising, sings the sacred tale,</br>And the loud chorus ecchos thro' the dale.", "PRIESTESS.</br>Far from the burning sands of Calabar;</br>Far from the lustre of the morning star;</br>Far from the pleasure of the holy morn;</br>Far from the blessedness of Chalma's horn,</br>Now rest the souls of Narva and Mored,</br>Laid in the dust, and number'd with the dead.</br>Dear are their memories to us, and long,</br>Long, shall their attributes be known in song.</br>Their lives were transient as the meadow</br>Ripen'd in ages, wither'd in an hour.</br>Chalma reward them in his gloomy cave,</br>And open all the prisons of the grave.</br>Bred to the service of the godhead's throne,</br>And living but to serve his God alone;</br>Narva was beauteous as the op'ning day;</br>When on the spangling waves the sun beams play.</br>When the Mackaw ascending to the sky,</br>Views the bright splendor with a steady eye.</br>Tall, as the house of Chalma's dark retreat;</br>Compact and firm, as Rhadal Ynca's fleet.</br>Completely beauteous, as a summer's sun,</br>Was Narva, by his excellence undone.</br>Where the soft Togla creeps along the meeds,</br>Thro' scented Calamus and fragrant reeds;</br>Where the sweet Zinsa spreads its matted bed,</br>Liv'd the still sweeted flow'r, the young Mored.</br>Black was her face, as Togla's hidden cell;</br>Soft as the moss where hooting adders dwell.</br>As to the sacred court she brought a fawn,</br>The festive tenant of the spicy lawn</br>She saw and lov'd!  and Narva too forgot</br>His sacred vestment, and his mystic lot.</br>Long had the mutual sigh, the mutual tear,</br>Burst from the breast, and scorn'd confinement there.</br>Existence was a torment!  O my breast!</br>Can I find accents to unfold the rest!</br>Lock'd in each others arms, from Hyga's cave,</br>They plung'd relentless to a watry grave;</br>And falling murmur'd to the pow'rs above,</br>Gods!  take our lives unless we live to love.</br>"]
