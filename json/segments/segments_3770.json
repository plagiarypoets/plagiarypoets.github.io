["Now on the Chambermaid's astonish'd ear</br>Th' awakening clock with solemn, awful sound,</br>Strikes nine!  Up springs the bonny lass, nor heeds</br>The fond regrets, the soft seducing voice,</br>Of JOHN, the Footman, her enamour'd swain,</br>But straight with nimble hand and sturdy broom</br>Repairs the havock caus'd by rout or drum.</br>Now, does the SWEEP, with sootbag at his back,</br>Patrole with limping pace the vacant street,</br>And, like the cricket, utter their shrill cry:</br>Now, too, the MILKMAID, with her well-fill'd pails,</br>Marks on the door, numerically true,</br>The chalky score, and ne'er marks two for one:</br>Now, from the purlieus of Queen Anne-Street East</br>The heedless Youth steals forth, with hair dishevel'd,</br>No glossy black adorns his boots or shoes,</br>His neckcloth pines to meet the Washer's grasp,</br>And thus the sloven, with disordered pace,</br>Or in the shelter of some friendly hack,</br>Arrives at home to meet the lecture dire:</br>Now do the sturdy DUSTMEN beat their rounds,</br>And at the summons of their oft toll'd bell</br>[Line illegible]</br>A lucky hit produce a silver spoon,</br>Straight to the Pawnbroker's they eager hie,</br>Receive the loan and quaff large draughts of purl:</br>Now do the Hackney-coachmen watchful ply&mdash;</br>Now does the BACHANALIAN quit his glass&mdash;</br>Now does the spruce APPRENTICE ope his shop&mdash;</br>And now the SHOEBLACK stirs his jetty bowl.</br>Therefore, Oh MUSE, leave off descriptive strains,</br>And taste with me the joys of rural plains.</br>"]
