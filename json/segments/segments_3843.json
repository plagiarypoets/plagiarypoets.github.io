["When Werter fair Charlotte beheld,</br>As she danc'd with the nymphs on the green,</br>He thought ev'ry maid she excell'd,</br>And he prais'd the soft grace of her mien;</br>But all her accomplishments known,</br>Gentle Werter began to adore,</br>He sighs for a heart not her own,</br>And the joys of poor Werter are o'er.", "Tho' vows the fair Charlotte engag'd,</br>As a friend gentle Werter was dear;</br>Her smiles oft his sorrows asswag'd,</br>While pity has dropt a soft tear;</br>Urg'd by love, he grew bold, and she cry'd,</br>Werter leave, and see me no more&mdash;</br>He sigh'd &mdash; he obey'd &mdash; and he dy'd,</br>Then the sorrows of Werter deplore.", "Ye nymphs let not Cupid deceive,</br>Under pity's soft garb hide his dart,</br>Werter's sorrows are laid in the grave,</br>While pity still wrings Charlotte's heart;</br>And oft o'er his grave has she cry'd,</br>While with flow'rets she deck't it all o'er&mdash;</br>He saw me &mdash; he lov'd &mdash; and he dy'd,</br>Then the sorrows of Werter deplore.</br>"]
