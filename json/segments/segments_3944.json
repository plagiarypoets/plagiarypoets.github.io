["Ye shepherds and nymphs of the plain,</br>O attend for a while to my lays;</br>Give heed to a sorrowful swain,</br>Who all his misfortunes displays.", "Lucinda, the lovely, the gay,</br>Who all my affections doth share,</br>She's sweet as the flowers in May,</br>But cruel, alas!  as she's fair.", "She treats me with scorn and disdain,</br>My sighs are all lost in her ears;</br>She triumphs and laughs at my pain,</br>And cruelly sports at my tears!", "Thus, despairing, I spend all my days,</br>Nor can I expect to be blest;</br>Depriv'd both of comfort and ease,</br>My soul is a stranger to rest.", "I'll seek some disconsolate cell,</br>Remote from the maid I adore,</br>No more near her beauties I'll dwell,</br>I'll contemplate her virtues no more", "There unknown I'll repeat all my woes,</br>Unheard of lament my hard fate;</br>Since Lucinda such cruelty shews,</br>Death only shall end my sad state.</br>"]
