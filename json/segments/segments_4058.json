["And now, thou gentle shade of rural bard,</br>Whose lines I oft have ey'd with soft regard,</br>If humblest efforts ever can thee move</br>From mourning o'er the relicks of thy love,</br>Come to my HAPPY VILLAGE, and behold</br>Thy AUBURN'S self each homely bliss unfold;</br>See here the sign-post firm, the pastor good,</br>And every rustic charm as once it stood.</br>Haste, gentle shade!  on wafting Zephyrs borne,</br>Forsake thy haunts deserted and forlorn,</br>Prove the kind guardian of the peaceful scene,</br>Where all thy long-lost beauties shine serene;</br>Speed on thy airy flight to BLANCHLAND fair,</br>And sometimes think of him who call'd thee there;</br>Approve his essay from thy lofty seat;</br>And if above our spirits ever meet,</br>We both shall, happy mortals, bless and sing</br>Eternal praises to our HEAV'NLY KING.</br>"]
