["Fond Shepherds attend to my notes,</br>The charms of Cecelia I sing:</br>Kind warblers come tune your sweet throats,</br>With the tend'rest notes of the spring.</br>Let the woodlands, with melody sound;</br>The Zephyrs, with harmony glow;</br>The vallies, with echo resound;</br>And rills with soft tenderness flow.", "Cecelia's soft accents excell,</br>To friendship she sounds her kind lute:</br>The swains with pure extacy swell,</br>The lambkins are silent and mute.</br>The Nightingale moves to her rest,</br>To silence she's charm'd by the fair,</br>While the Thrush's soft notes do attest,</br>The Shepherd opprest by loves care.", "High transports, my bosom inspire:</br>I gaze and am lost in delight!</br>Even Seraphs, might gaze and admire,</br>Where charms thus celesti'l unite.</br>\"With her mien, she inamours the brave,</br>With her wit, she engages the free,</br>With her modesty, pleases the grave;</br>She's ev'ry way pleasing to me.\"", "The Nectar which rests on each lip,</br>The Gods, might contend for in vain,</br>Not Cupid, his arrow shall dip;</br>'Tis decreed to the worthy'st swain.</br>Thrice happy!  that swain when possest,</br>Of Cecelia's hand (with her heart)&mdash;</br>He!  shall with contentment be blest,</br>His lambs too their gladness impart.</br>"]
