["Swells then thy feeling heart, and streams thine eye</br>O'er the deserted being, poor and old,</br>Whom cold, reluctant parish charity</br>Consigns to mingle with his kindred mould?", "Mourn'st thou, that here, the time-worne sufferer ends</br>Those evil days, that promis'd woes to come,</br>HERE, where the friendless feel no want of friends,</br>Where e'en the houseless Wanderer finds a home!", "What tho' no kindred crowd in sable forth,</br>And sigh, or seem to sigh around the bier;</br>Tho' o'er his coffin, with the humid earth</br>No children drop the unavailing tear;", "Rather, rejoice, that HERE, HIS sorrows cease,</br>Whom sickness, age, and poverty oppress'd;</br>Where Death, the Leveller &mdash; restores the peace</br>The wretch who living knew not where to rest.", "Ah!  think, that this poor outcast, spurn'd by fate,</br>Who a long race of pain and sorrow ran,</br>Is in the grave, even as the rich and great&mdash;</br>Death vindicates the insulted Rights of Man.", "Rejoice!  that tho' severe his earthly doom,</br>Tho' rude, and strewn with thorns the path he trod,</br>Now, where unfeeling fortune cannot come,</br>He rests upon \"the bosom of his God!\"</br>"]
