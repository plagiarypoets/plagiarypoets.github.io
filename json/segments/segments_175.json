["THE FIRST SECTION.</br>Truth sayes of old, and we must owe that truth</br>Unto tradition, when the world in youth,</br>Which was the golden age, brought forth the pen,</br>Love and the Muses, which since gave to men</br>Inheritance of Fame, for these began</br>At once, and were all coetanean.</br>A happy season, when the ayre was cleare;</br>No sicknesse, nor infection did appeare,</br>No sullen change of seasons did molest</br>The fruitfull soyle, but the whole yeare was blest</br>With a perpetuall Spring, no Winter storme</br>Did crispe the Hills, nor mildew blast the Corne:</br>Yet happier farre, in that it forth did bring</br>The subject of this verse, whereof I sing</br>Under the Zenith of Heavens milke-white way,</br>Is a faire country called Lusinia,</br>'Tis Natures chiefest Wardrop, where doe lye</br>Her ornaments of rich variety:</br>Where first her glorious Mantle she puts on,</br>When through the world she rides procession;</br>Here dwelt a King and Queene of mighty power,</br>Judg'd for their vertues, worthy such a dower.</br>They had betwixt themselves three Daughters born,</br>Conspicuous for their comlinesse and forme.</br>The elder two did neither much excell,</br>But then the younger had no parallel;</br>Whose lovely cheekes with Heavenly luster shone,</br>And eyes were farre too bright to looke upon:</br>Nay, it is credible, though fancies wing</br>Should mount above the Orbes, and thence downe bring</br>Th' Elixar of all beauty, and dispence</br>Unto one creature, the whole influence,</br>And harmony of the Spheares, it might not dare</br>With her for face and feature, to compare</br>Zeuxis the painter, who to draw one peece,</br>Survay'd the choycest Virgins of all Greece,</br>Had rested here, his Art without this stir,</br>Might have beene bounded, and confin'd in her.</br>Looke how the spiced fields in Autumne smell,</br>And rich perfumes, that in Arabia dwell:</br>Such was her fragrant sweetnesse, the Sunnes Bird,</br>The Phoenix fled farre off, and was afeard</br>To be seene neere, least she his pride should quell,</br>Or make him seeme a common spectacle.</br>Nor did the painted Peacocke once presume,</br>Within her presence to display his plume.</br>Nor Rose, nor Lilly durst their Silkes unfold,</br>But shut their leaves up like the Marygold.</br>They all had beene ill favour'd, she alone</br>Was judg'd the Mistresse of perfection.</br>Her fame spread farre abroad, and thither brought</br>Thousands, that gazing worshipt her, and thought</br>The Goddesse, whom the greene-fac'd Sea had bred,</br>And dew of foaming waves had nourished.</br>Venus her selfe, regardlesse of her honour,</br>Did live with mortals, whosoe'r lookt on her,</br>Even most prophane, did think she was divine,</br>And grudg'd not to doe worship to her shrine.</br>For this cause, Venus Temples were defac'd,</br>Her sacrifice, and Ceremonies rac'd;</br>Her widdowed Altars in cold ashes mourn'd,</br>Her Images uncrown'd, her Groves deform'd:</br>Her Rites were all polluted with contempt,</br>For none to Paphos, nor Cytheros went.</br>This Maide was sole ador'd, Venus displeas'd,</br>Might in this Virgin onely be appeas'd:</br>The people in the street to her would bow,</br>And as she past along, would Garlands strow.</br>Venus at this conceiv'd a jealous ire,</br>(For heavenly minds burne with an earthly fire)</br>And spake with indignation, What shall I,</br>Mother of Elements, and loftiest skie,</br>Beginner of the world, Parent of Nature,</br>Pertake mine honour with an earthly creature?</br>Shall silly girles destin'd to death, and Fate,</br>My high-borne name, and stile contaminate?</br>In vaine did then the Phrygian Shepheard give</br>The Ball to me, when three of us did strive</br>Who should excel in beauty, and all stood</br>Naked before the Boy, to tempt his blood,</br>When they with Royall gifts sought to beguile</br>His judgement, I alur'd him with a smile:</br>But this usurper of my dignities,</br>Shall have but little cause to boast the prize;</br>With that she call'd her rash, and winged child</br>Arm'd with Bow, Torch, and quiver:  that is wild</br>With mischiefe; he that with his evil waies</br>Corrupts all publick discipline, and straies</br>Through chambers in the night, and with false beames,</br>Or with his stinging Arrowes, or with dreames,</br>Tempts unto lust, and does no good at all:</br>This childe I say did Venus to her call,</br>And stirres him up with words malitious,</br>That was by nature too licentious:</br>For bringing him where Psyche dwelt, for so</br>This Maid was call'd, she there unfolds her woe,</br>And emulous tale.  Cupid quoth she, my stay,</br>My onely strength, and power, whose boundles sway,</br>Contemnes the thunder of my Father Jove,</br>I here intreate thee by thy Mothers love,</br>Those wounding sweets, and sweet wounds of thy Quiver,</br>And honey burnings of thy torch, deliver</br>My Soule from griefe, revenge me on this mayd</br>And all her boasted beauty see decay'd,</br>Or else strike her in love with one so poore,</br>So miserably lost, stript of all store</br>Of meanes, or vertue; so deform'd of limb,</br>That none in all the world may equall him.</br>To move her Sonne, no flattering words she spar'd,</br>But breath'd on him with kisses, long and hard,</br>This done; she hasts to the next ebbing shore,</br>And with her rosie feet insulting ore</br>The submisse waves, a Dolphin she bestrides,</br>And on the utmost Billows proudly rides.</br>A troupe of Tritons were straight sounding heard,</br>And rough Portumnus with his mossy beard,</br>Salacia heavy with her fishy traine,</br>And Nereus daughters came to entertaine</br>The Sea-borne Goddesse; some plaid on a shell,</br>Some with their Garments labour'd to expell</br>The scorching heat, and Sun-shine from her face,</br>And other some did hold a looking-glasse:</br>All these in triumph by the Dolphin swam,</br>And followed Venus to the Ocean;</br>Psyche the while, in this great height of blisse,</br>Yet reapes no fruit of all her happinesse,</br>For neither King, nor Prince, nor Potentate,</br>Nor any durst attempt her for a mate,</br>But as a polisht picture her admire,</br>And in that admiration cease desire:</br>Her Sisters both, whose moderate beauty none</br>Did much despise, nor much contemplate on,</br>Were to their wishes happily contracted,</br>And by two Kings espous'd.  Psyche distracted</br>Because she had no lover, pensive sate</br>In mind, and body, and began to hate,</br>And curse that beauty, and esteeme at nought,</br>Which, but was excellent, had no other fault.</br>Cupid now in a causelesse rage was gone,</br>To whet his Arrowes on a bloody stone,</br>As if he were t' encounter with some maine</br>Monster, like Python, by Apollo slaine,</br>Or Jove, or Titan lame; or once agen,</br>Draw the pale Moone downe to the Latmian Den,</br>Or with Loves fire great Pluto to annoy,</br>For these were workes of labour, and the Boy</br>Was ignorant, how matters would succeed,</br>Or what the fate of Beauty had Decreed.</br>Therefore he fyl'd his arrowes sharpe and smal,</br>To pierce what ever they should meet withal.</br>And vow'd, if cause were, he his shafts would shiver,</br>'Gainst Psyches breast, and empty all his Quiver.</br>Themis a Goddesse, whom great Jove had sent</br>Into the World, for good, or punishment,</br>As justice should require, when she did heare</br>Cupid so proudly boast, againe did sweare,</br>That she his haughty malice would abate,</br>And turne the edge, both of his shafts, and hate.</br>And having thus disarm'd him, ten to one,</br>Would change his fury to affection.</br>A clap of Thunder all about them shooke,</br>To ratifie, what Themis undertooke.</br>Then both together went, and entring found,</br>Faire Psyche, with her looks fixt on the ground.</br>Honor and Modesty, with equall grace,</br>Simplicity and truth, smil'd in her face.</br>But rising up, there shot from eyther eye,</br>Such beames, as did Loves senses stupefie.</br>And as in this distraction he did stand,</br>He let his arrowes fall out of his hand.</br>Which Themis laughing tooke, and thence convay'd,</br>Whilst Cupid minded nothing but the Mayde.</br>Then did he crye amaz'd, what fence is here?</br>Beauty and Vertue have no other spheare.</br>Her brow's a Castle, and each lip a Fort,</br>Where thousand armed Deities resort</br>To guard the golden fruit from all surprize,</br>Chastly, and safe, as the Hesperides.</br>Pardon me, Venus, if I thee abridge</br>Of this unjust revenge; 'twere sacrilidge,</br>Beyond Prometheus theft, to quench such fire,</br>Or steale it from her eyes, but to inspire</br>Cupids owne breast, in all Loves spoyles, I yet</br>Never beheld so rich a Cabinet.</br>Jove, here for ever, here, my heart confine,</br>And let me all my Empery resigne.</br>Then looking downe, he found himselfe bereft</br>Of his loose armes, and smil'd at Themis theft;</br>Because he knew, she might as soone abide</br>Fire in her bosome, as Loves arrows hide.</br>But that they must againe with shame be sent,</br>And claime, for the possession, a deare rent:</br>Yet one dropt out by chance, and 'twas the best</br>Of all the bundle, and the curiousest.</br>The plumes were colour'd azure, white, and red,</br>The shaft painted alike downe to the head,</br>Which was of burnisht Gold:  this Cupid tooke,</br>And in revenge, through his owne bosome strooke:</br>Then sighing call'd, You Lovers all, in chiefe)</br>Whom I have wrong'd, come tryumph at my griefe;</br>See, and be satisfied for all my sinne,</br>'Tis not one place that I am pained in,</br>My Arrows venome is dispersed round,</br>And beauties signe is potent in each wound.</br>Thus he with pitty did himselfe deplore,</br>For never pitty enter'd him before.</br>Ill as he was, he tooke his flight, and came</br>Unto the palace of the Sun, whose flame</br>Was farre inferiour to what Cupid felt;</br>And said, deare Phoebus, if I still have dealt</br>Like a true friend, and stood thee in some steed,</br>When thou for love didst like a shepheard feed,</br>Admetus Cattle, now thine helpe impart,</br>Tis not for Phisicke, though I am sick at heart,</br>That I implore, but through thy skill devine</br>The fairest Psyche for my wife assigne:</br>Phoebus assents, and did not long delay,</br>To make it good by a Prophetick way;</br>Her Father fearing for the injury,</br>Offerd to Venus sacred Deity,</br>Consults the Delpick Oracle, who thus</br>Expounds his mind in tearmes ambiguous.", "THE ORACLE.</br>Your Daughter bring to a steepe mountaine spire,</br>Invested with a funerall attire;</br>Expect no good, but bind her to a stake,</br>No mortall wight, her for a wife

doe you thus with deepe fetch't sighs perplex</br>Your most unhappy age?  why doe you vexe</br>Your spirit, which is mine, and thus disgrace</br>With fruitlesse teares, your venerable face?</br>Why doe you teare your haire, and bear your brest?</br>Are these the hopefull issues, and the blest</br>Rewards for beauty?  then ought you lament,</br>When all the City with a joyn'd consent</br>Did stile me the new Venus, and ascrib'd</br>Those honours which to mortals are deny'd.</br>'Twas your ambition first pluckt on my shame,</br>I see, and feele my ruine in her name:</br>'Tis now to late, we suffer under those</br>Deepe wounds of envy, which the Gods impose;</br>Where is the rocke?  why doe you linger so?</br>Leade hence, my thinks I long to undergoe</br>This happy Marriage, and I long to see</br>My noble Husband, whatsoere he bee:</br>Into his armes, O let me soone be hurl'd,</br>That's borne for the destruction of the world.</br>This said, each stander by, with hang'd downe head</br>And mournfull pompe the Virgin followed,</br>And to the place prefixt her armes they tye,</br>Then howling forth a dolefull Elegy,</br>Depart from her in teares, wishing from farre</br>Some winged Perseus might deliver her.</br>Psyche affrighted thus, and they all gone,</br>A gentle gale of wind came posting on,</br>Who with his whispers having charm'd her feares,</br>The maid asleep on his soft bosome beares.</br>This wind is called Zephirus, whose mild</br>And fruitfull breath gets the young spring with child,</br>Filling her wombe with such delicious heat,</br>As breeds the blooming Rose, and Violet:</br>Him Cupid for his delicacy chose,</br>And did this amorous taske on him impose,</br>To fetch his Mistresse; but least he should burne</br>With beauties fire, he bad him

Gummes, and spices had perhaps a name,</br>But their first odours from her breathing came:</br>And in this manner Zephirus flew on</br>With wanton gyres, through every region</br>Of the vast ayre, then brought her to a vale,</br>Where thousand severall flowers her sweets exhale:</br>The whilst her parents rob'd of her deare sight,</br>Devote themselves to everlasting night.", "THE SECOND SECTION.</br>Thus Psyche on a grassy bed did lye,</br>Adorn'd with Floraes richest tapestry,</br>Where all her sences with soft slumber bound,</br>At last awakt, and rising from a swound</br>She spies

chance, is now befalne to thee;</br>A sexe pernitious to thine owne deare blood,</br>Has taken armes up to withstand thy good.</br>Againe thy sisters with regardlesse care</br>Of love, or pietie, come to ensnare,</br>And tempt thy faith, which I forbad before,</br>That thou my shape and visage shouldst explore:</br>In liew of which take up a like defence,</br>Protecting with religious continence,</br>Our house from ruine, and thy selfe prevent,</br>And our small pledge from dangers imminent.</br>Psyche with sighes and teares together blent,</br>Breakes off his speech, Since you a document</br>Have of my silence, and my love, quoth she,</br>Why should you feare to trust my constancie?</br>Which to confirme, bid Zephirus fulfill</br>Once more his duty, and obey my will.</br>That since your long'd for sight I am deny'd,</br>I may behold my sisters by my side.</br>Turne not away my love, I thee beseeke,</br>By thy curld haire, and by thy silken cheeke:</br>Deigne from thy bounty this small boone to spare,</br>Since the forc'd ignorance of what you are,</br>Must not offend me, nor the darkest night,</br>Where I embrace you in a greater light.</br>Charm'd with her sugred words, he gives consent,</br>That the swift winde, with haste incontinent;</br>Although unwilling, should display his wing,</br>And the she traytors to faire Psyche bring.</br>Thus all together met, her sisters twaine,</br>Embrace their prey, and a false love doe faine.</br>Psyche sayes one, you are a mother growne:</br>My thinkes your wombe like a full Rose is blowne.</br>O what a masse of comfort will accrew</br>Unto our friends and family from you?</br>Certs this your child, if it be halfe so faire</br>As is the mother, must be Cupids heire.</br>Thus they with flatteries, and with many a smile,</br>Pretending false affection, her beguile.</br>And she out of her innocence, poore mayd,</br>Gave easie credit unto all they sayd:</br>And too too kinde, to a faire chamber led,</br>Where with celestiall dainties she them fed.</br>She speakes unto the Lute, and straight it heares;</br>She calles for raptures, and they swell their eares.</br>All sorts of musicke sound, with many a lay,</br>Yet none was present seene to sing or play.</br>But as no mirth is pleasant to a dull</br>And heavie soule, no lesse, they that are full</br>Of cankred malice, all delight disdaine,</br>But what doth nourish their delighted paine.</br>So that no gifts nor price might mollifie,</br>Nor no reward, nor kindnesse qualifie</br>Ther hardned hearts, still they are on fire,</br>To sound her through, and make a strict inquire,</br>What was her husband, what his forme, and age,</br>And whence he did deduce his parentage:</br>You read, how from simplicity at first,</br>She fram'd a formall story, and what erst</br>Shee told, she had forgot, and gan to faine</br>Another tale, and of another straine:</br>How that he was a man both rich, and wise,</br>Of middle yeeres, and of a middle size:</br>A Merchant by profession, that did deale</br>For many thousands in the common-weale.</br>With that they checkt her in the full careere</br>Of her discourse, sayes one, Nay sister deare,</br>Pray doe not strive thus to impose upon</br>Your loving friends, sure this description</br>Must to his person needs be contrary,</br>When in it selfe your speech does disagree.</br>You lately boasted, he was young and faire;</br>What does the soyle, or nature of the aire</br>Bring age so soone?  and that he us'd to range</br>About the woods, loe there's another change.</br>Doe you conceit so ignorantly of us,</br>We know not Tethis from Hippolitus?</br>Green fields from seas, a billow from a hill,</br>Fishes from beasts?  then we had little skill.</br>You much dissemble, or you have forgot</br>His forme, and function, or you know them not.</br>Then with the pressure of her eyes, she freed</br>One teare from prison, and did thus proceed:</br>Psyche we grieve, and pitty you, that thus</br>Are growne so carelesse, and incurious</br>Of what you ought to feare:  you thinke your selfe</br>Much happy in your husband, and your selfe,</br>But are deceiv'd, for we that watch,</br>And at each opportunity doe catch,</br>To satisfie our doubts, for truth have found,</br>Both by his crawling footsteps on the ground,</br>And by report of neighbouring husbandmen,</br>That have espy'd him flying from his den.</br>When he to them most hideously has yeeld,</br>From his huge throat, with blood and poyson swel'd,</br>That this your husband is of Serpent breed,</br>Either of Cadmus, or of Hydra's seed.</br>Call but the Pythian Oracle to minde.</br>That you to such hard destiny assign'd,</br>And think not all your art, or policy,</br>Can cancell his propheticall decree.</br>Let not his Monsters usage for awhile,</br>Your soule of just suspicion beguile,</br>As that yon still shall live at such high rate,</br>And that these happy dayes shal ne're have date.</br>Far be it, that my words should ill portend,</br>Yet trust me, all these joyes must have an end:</br>The time will come, when this your Paramour,</br>In whom you so delight, shall you devoure.</br>And when your womb casts her abortive brood,</br>Then Saturne like, he will make that his food.</br>For this prediction also bore a share,</br>In what the god fore-told, but lest despaire</br>Should load you with too great oppression,</br>It was conceal'd, and therefore stands upon,</br>Whether through our advice, you will be sav'd,</br>Or in his beastly entrayles be engrav'd.</br>Now if this uncouth life, and solitude</br>Please you, then follow it, and be still stew'd</br>In the ranke lust of a lascivious worme:</br>Yet we our pious duties shall performe.</br>Psyche that tender was, grew wan, and pale,</br>And swoone for dread of this so sade a tale.</br>Then fell she from the spheare of her right mind,</br>And forgot all those precepts she combin'd,</br>And vow'd to keepe, and her selfe headlong threw</br>Into a thousand griefes, that must ensue.</br>At last reviv'd, having her selfe upheav'd,</br>With fainting voyce, thus half her words out breathd.</br>Truely my sisters deare, full well I see</br>How you persist in constant piety:</br>Nor did they, who suggest such words as these,</br>In my opinion altogether lease:</br>For to this houre, I never did survay</br>My husbands shape, but forc'd am to obay</br>What he commands, and doe embrace i'th night,</br>A thing uncertaine, and that shunnes the light:</br>Therefore to your assertions I assent,</br>That with good reason seeme so congruent;</br>For in my thoughts I can not judge at least</br>But he must be a monster, or some beast;</br>Hee uses so much cautionary care,</br>And threatens so much ill, if I should dare</br>To view his face; so I referre me to</br>Your best advice, t' instruct me what to doe:</br>Her sisters now ariv'd at the full scope</br>Of their base plots, and seeing the gate ope</br>That kept her heart, scorne any artfull bayt,</br>But use their downe right weapons of deceit:</br>Saying, Deare Psyche, nature should prevaile</br>So much with us, if mischiefe did assaile</br>Your person, in our sight:  we were too blame</br>Should we permit, and not divert the same;</br>Yet wise men have their waies, and eyes still cleare,</br>And leave no mists of danger, or of feare:</br>You doe but brave your death, when you repell</br>The whispers of your Genius, which would tell</br>The perill you are in; nor are you sure</br>Of longer life, till you are quite secure:</br>Which to effect, provide a sword that's keene,</br>And with it, a bright Lampe, and both unseene</br>Hide in some place, untill a fitting houre</br>Shall call them, to assist you with their power:</br>Trust me, such spies, and counsellors are mute,</br>And never nice, or slow to execute</br>Any designe; so when your husbands eyes</br>Are seal'd with sleepe, from your soft couch arise,</br>And seaze this Dragon, when he least takes heed,</br>Like Pallas arm'd, and to his death proceed;</br>And where his necke, and head, are joyn'd in one,</br>Make me a speedy seperation:</br>Alcides sonne of Jove, as rumour goes,</br>Strangled two Serpents in his swadling cloathes:</br>And can your strength faile to bring that to passe,</br>Which halfe the labour of an infant was?</br>Such wicked words they poure into her eare,</br>More poysonous then her husband could appeare.</br>Psyche was troubled, as the sea, in mind</br>Approv'd their councell, and againe declin'd</br>What they perswade; now hastens, now delayes,</br>Dares, and not dares, and with a blush betrayes</br>Her wandring passion, which knowes no meane,</br>But travels from extreame, unto extreame:</br>She loves him now, and does againe detest,</br>Loves as a husband, hates him as a beast.</br>The onely checke, and bridle to her hate,</br>Was the fam'd story, and revengefull fate</br>Of Danans daughters, who in hell are bound</br>To fill a Vessell, they can never sound:</br>She told the story to them, how all these</br>Were fifty Virgins, call'd the Belides;</br>Her Sisters list, while Psyche does discover,</br>How each was too in humane to her lover:</br>And in one night made all their husbands bleed;</br>With hearts, hard as the steele, that did the deed:</br>Yet one sayes she, most worthy of the name</br>Of wife, and to it everlasting fame:</br>Hight Hypermnestra, with officious lye,</br>Met with her Father; and his perjury:</br>Who said unto her husband, Youth arise,</br>Least a long sleepe unfear'd, doe thee surprize.</br>I will not hold thee captive, nor will strike</br>This to thy heart; although my sisters, like</br>So many cruell Lyonesses, voyd</br>Of mercy, all their husbands have destroy'd.</br>I am of nature soft, nor doe I dare</br>To view, much lesse to act thy massacre;</br>What though my Father me in prison lay,</br>Or loade with Iron chaines, or send away</br>Farre from his Kingdome, into banishment,</br>Or tortures use, cause I would not consent</br>To murder thee; however take thy flight,</br>Post for thy life, whilst Venus and the night</br>Doe favour thee, and onely this vouchsafe</br>When I am dead, to write my Epitaph:</br>The meere remembrance of this vertuous deed,</br>Did a remorce, and kind of pitty breed</br>In Psyches brest, for passions are infus'd,</br>According to the stories, we are us'd</br>To reade; and many men doe amorous prove,</br>By viewing acts, and monuments of love:</br>But yet her sisters malice, that still stood</br>In opposition, against all thats good,</br>Ceases not to precipitate her on,</br>Till they had gain'd this confirmation;</br>To put in act what ere they did desire,</br>Thus fury like, they did her soule inspire:</br>Night and her husband came, and now the sport</br>Of Venus ended, he began to snort,</br>Psyche, though weake of mind, and body both,</br>Yet urg'd by cruell fate, and her rash oath,</br>Rose up to make provision for her sinne;</br>Lye still faire maide, thou mayst more honour win,</br>And make thy murder glory, not a crime,</br>If thou wouldst kill those thoughts, that doe beslime</br>And knaw upon thy breast, and never cease</br>With hishing clamours to disturbe thy peace,</br>When thine owne heart with Serpents doth abound;</br>Seeke not without, that may within be found.</br>Yet was she not so cruell in her hast,</br>But ere she kild him, she his lips would tast,</br>Wishing she neede not rise out from her bed,</br>But that she had the power to kisse him dead:</br>Now with her lips she labours all she may,</br>To sucke his soule out, whilst he sleeping lay,</br>Till she at last through a transfused kisse,</br>Left her owne soule, and was inspir'd with his;</br>And had her soule within his body stay'd,</br>Till he therein his vertues had convay'd,</br>And all pollution would from thence remove,</br>Then after all her thoughts had beene of love;</br>But since she could not both of them retaine,</br>She restor'd his, and tooke her owne againe:</br>Sorry, that she was forc'd it to transferr,</br>And wisht though dead, that he might live in her:</br>Then in the one hand she held the emulous light,</br>And in the other tooke the sword, so bright</br>As 'twould her beauty, and the fire out-shine,</br>And she thus arm'd, became more masculine.</br>But when by friendship of the Lampe, her eye</br>Had made a perfect true discovery</br>Of all was in the roome, what did she see?</br>Object of Love, wonder of Deity.</br>The god of love himselfe, Cupid the faire,</br>Lye sweetly sleeping in his golden haire:</br>At this so heavenly sight, the lampy spire</br>Encreas'd his flames, and burnt more pure, and higher.</br>The very sencelesse sacrilegious steele,</br>Did a strong vertue from his presence feele,</br>Which turn'd the edge, poore Psyche all amaz'd,</br>With joy, and wonder on his beauty gaz'd.</br>His necke so white, his colour so exact,</br>His limbes, that were so curiously compact:</br>His body sleeke, and smooth, that it might not</br>Venus repent, t' have such a sonne begot.</br>A bright reflexion and perfumed sent,</br>Fill'd all the roome with a mixt blandishment,</br>Shot from his wings, and at his feete did lye</br>His bow, and arrows, and his armory.</br>And in this extasie she thought to hide</br>The cursed steele, but in her owne deare side;</br>And had perform'd it sure, had not the sword,</br>Flew from her hand, out of its owne accord.</br>Glansing on all with eyes unsatisfied,</br>At last she his artillerye spyed.</br>The Quiver was of needle-worke wrought round</br>With trophies of his owne, where Cupid crown'd</br>Sate in the midst, with a Bay-wreath, which he</br>Had proudly pluckt from the Peneian tree.</br>Next Venus and Adonis, sad with paine,</br>The one of love, the other of disdaine:</br>There Jove in all his borrowed shapes was drest,</br>His thefts, and his adulteries exprest,</br>As Emblemes of Loves tryumph; and these were</br>Drawne with such lively colours, men would sweare,</br>That Laeda lay within a perfect bower,</br>And Danaes golden streames, were a true shower.</br>Saturns two other sonnes did seeme to throw</br>Their Tridents at his feete, and him allow</br>For their Supreme; and there were kneeling by</br>Gods, Nymphs, and all their Geneology</br>Since the first Chaos, saving the abuse,</br>And Cupids pride, none could the worke traduce.</br>Pallas in envy of Aracknes skill,</br>Or else to curry favour, and fulfill</br>Cupids behest, which she durst not withstand,</br>Had fram'd the emulous peece with her owne hand.</br>And there were portray'd more a thousand loves</br>Besides himselfe; the skinnes of Turtle-doves</br>Lin'd it within, and at the upper end,</br>A silver plate the Quiver did extend,</br>Full of small holes, where his bright shafts did lye;</br>Whose plumes were stiffe with gummes of Araby.</br>His Bow was of the best, and finest Yew</br>That in all Ida, or faire Tempe grew:</br>Smooth as his cheeke, and checkerd as his wing,</br>And at each end, tipt with a Pearle; the string</br>Drawne from the Optick of a Ladies eye,</br>That whensoere he shoots, strikes harmony.</br>Psyche with timorous heed, did softly touch</br>His weapons, least her prophane hand might smutch</br>The glosse of them:  then drew a shaft, whose head</br>Was wrought of Gold, for some are done with Lead,</br>And laid her fingers end upon the Dart,</br>Tempting the edge, untill it caus'd a smart:</br>For being pointed sharpe, it raz'd the skin,</br>Till drops of blood did trickle from within.</br>She wounded with the poison, which it bore,</br>Grew more in love, than ere she was before.</br>Then as she would her selfe incorporate,</br>She did her numerous kisses equall make</br>Unto his haires, that with her breath did play,</br>Steept with rich Nectar, and Ambrosia.</br>Thus being ravisht with excesse of joy,</br>With kissing, and embracing the sweet Boy.</br>Loe, in the height of all her jollity,</br>Whether from envy, or from treachery:</br>Or that it had a burning appetite,</br>To touch that silken skin, that lookt so white.</br>The wicked Lampe, in an unlucky houre,</br>A drop of scalding oyle did let downe powre</br>On his right shoulder, whence in horrid wise</br>A blister, like a bubble did arise,</br>And boyl'd up in his flesh, with a worse fume,</br>Then blood of Vipers, or the Lernean spume.</br>Neere did the Dog-starre rage with so great heate</br>In dry Apulia, nor Alcides sweat</br>Under his shirt so.  Cruell oyle, that thou</br>Who of all others hast the smoothest brow,</br>Shouldst play the traytor?  who had any thing</br>Worse than thy selfe; as fire, or venom'd sting,</br>Or Sulphur blasted him, shouldst first have came,</br>And with thy powerfull breath suckt out the flame.</br>For though he be Loves god, it were but vaine,</br>To thinke he should be privilidg'd from paine.</br>For we in Homer have like wounded read,</br>Of Mars, and Venus, both by Diomed.</br>But for this haynous and audacious fact,</br>Cupid among his statutes did enact,</br>Henceforth all lights be banisht, and exempt,</br>From bearing office in Loves government.</br>And in the day, each should his passage marke,</br>Or learne to finde his Mistresse in the darke.</br>Sure all the crew of lovers shall thee hate,</br>Nor blest Minerva hold thee consecrate.</br>When Cupid saw his counsells open laid,</br>Psyches deare faith, and his owne plots betrayd,</br>He buckled on his wings, away to fly;</br>And had she not caught hold upon his thigh,</br>And hung as an appendix of his flight,</br>He questionlesse had vanisht from her sight.</br>But as when men are in deepe rivers drown'd,</br>And tane up dead, have their close fingers found,</br>Clasping the weeds; so, though her armes were rackt</br>With her more bodies weight, and sinews crackt,</br>To follow him through the forc'd Element:</br>Yet held she fast, untill he did relent,</br>And his ambitious wings gan downward steere,</br>And stoope to earth, with a mild Cancileere.", "THE FOURTH SECTION.</br>Thus lighted on the earth, he tooke her wrist,</br>And wrung it hard, and did her hands untwist:</br>And having freed himselfe, he flew on high,</br>Unto a Cypresse tree that grew thereby,</br>And on the utmost branches being sate,</br>He did the matter thus capitulate,</br>Was it for this indeed, for this reward,</br>Thou silly girle, that I should disregard</br>My mothers vowes, her teares, her flatteries?</br>When she, with all the power she might devise,</br>Provok't me to thy hurt, and thee assign'd</br>In Marriage, to a groome of some base kind,</br>And lowest ranke, had not my too much hast</br>Redeem'd thy shame, and my owne worth disgrac'd;</br>Was it for this I did thy plagues remove,</br>To paine my selfe?  strike mine owne heart in love,</br>With mine owne shaft, that after all this geare,</br>I should no better then a beast appeare?</br>For this, wouldst thou cut off my head, which bore</br>Those eyes, that did thy beauty so adore?</br>And yet thou knowst ungratefull wretch, how I</br>Did with my feares, thy mischeifes still imply,</br>And every day my cautions did renew,</br>The breach of which thou must for ever rue:</br>And each of these thy sisters, that were guide</br>To thy ill act, shall dearely it abide:</br>Yet will I punish thee no other way</br>But onely this, I will for ever stray</br>Farre from thy sight, and having said so, fled,</br>Whilst she to heare this newes, lay almost dead:</br>Yet prostrate on the ground, her eyes up cast,</br>Ty'd to his winged speed; untill at last,</br>She could no more discerne; as Dido, then,</br>Or Ariadne, by some Poets pen,</br>Are fayn'd to grieve; whose artfull passions flow</br>In such sweet numbers, as they make their woe</br>Appeare delightfull, telling how unkind</br>Their lovers stole away, and the same wind,</br>That blew abroad their faith, and oathes before,</br>Then fill'd their sayles, and how the troubled shore</br>Answer'd the Ladies groanes, so Psyche faints,</br>And beates her breast with pittifull complaints.</br>There ran a River neere, whose purling streames,</br>Hyperion oft, did with his golden beames</br>Delight to gild, and as it fled along</br>The pleasant murmurs, mixt with the sweet song</br>Of aged Swannes, detayn'd the frequent eare</br>Of many a Nymph, which did inhabitt there:</br>Poore Psyche thither went, and from the brim,</br>In sad despaire threw her selfe headlong in.</br>The Rivers God; whither 'twere out of feare,</br>Duty, or love, or honour he did beare</br>Her husband; or least her spilt blood should staine</br>His christall current, threw her up againe:</br>But it is thought, he would not let her sinke,</br>Cause Cupid oft times would descend to drinke,</br>Or wash him in the Brooke, and when he came</br>To coole his owne heat, would the floud inflame.</br>Pan at that time sate playing on a reed,</br>Whilst his rough Goates did on the meddowes feed,</br>And with intentive eyes observed all,</br>That to the fayrest Psyche did befall;</br>Who seeing her thus pittiously distrest,</br>He ran to take her up, and did the best</br>He could to comfort her; faire maid, sayes he,</br>Though I a rustick, and a shepheard be,</br>Scorne not for that my counsell, and advice;</br>Nor let my trade become my prejudice,</br>Forby the benefit of time well spent,</br>I am indued with long experiment:</br>And if I doe conjecture it aright,</br>The cause of all this Phrensie, and dispight,</br>Which your sad lookes, and palenesse doe imply,</br>With other signes in Physiognomy,</br>By which wise men the truth of Art doe prove,</br>And know the state of minds, you are in love.", "Now list to me, and doe not with fond hast</br>The sacred oyle of your lifes taper wast:</br>Use no sinister meanes, to hasten on,</br>But labour to adjourne destruction,</br>Cast not away your selfe by too much griefe,</br>But courage take; for care is beauties thiefe:</br>Cupid I know, whose humour is to strive,</br>Then yeeld, then stay, then play the fugitive.</br>Be not dismayd for that, but shew your duty,</br>And above all things doe not spoyle your beauty,</br>Hee's delicate, and wanton, prayers may win,</br>And faire demeaoure may demerit him,</br>These are the medicines I would have you chuse,</br>To cure your minds health, and redresse abuse:</br>She gave him thankes, then rose from where she lay,</br>And having done obeysance went her way;</br>Thence did she wander on with weary feet,</br>And neither track, nor passenger could meet,</br>Untill at length she found a Kingly roade</br>Which led unto a Palace, where aboade</br>Her eldest sister.  Psyche enter'd in,</br>Then sent up newes, how one of her neere kin,</br>Was come to visite her, returne being made,</br>Psyche was brought before her; each invade</br>The other with embraces, and fulfill</br>A tedious scene of countefeit good will.</br>But when they had discours'd a while together,</br>She askt Psyche the cause, that brought her thither,</br>Who did recount the passages, and tell,</br>In order all the story that befell,</br>Which by degrees had ruind her; and laid</br>The blame on their lewd counsell, that betray'd</br>Her innocent soule, and her firme faith misled,</br>To murder her deare husband in his bed:</br>She told how she his certaine death decreed,</br>And how she rose to execute the deed:</br>She told, how like a Lyonesse she far'd,</br>And like an armed fury, how she star'd,</br>Or like a blazing comet in the ayre,</br>With fire, and sword, and with disshevell'd haire,</br>She told the trouble, and Epitasis,</br>When she beheld his Metamorphosis:</br>A spectacle, that ravisht her with joy,</br>A Serpent turn'd into a lovely boy,</br>Whose young, smoth face, might speake him boy or maid:</br>Cupid himselfe in a soft slumber lay'd,</br>She told too of the drop of scalding oyle,</br>That burnt his shoulder, and the heavy coyle</br>He kept, when he awakt, caus'd by the smart;</br>And how he chid, and how at last did part:</br>And for revenge, had threatned in her stead,</br>To make her sisters partners of his bed,</br>And twixt each word, she let a teare downe fall,</br>Which stopt her voyce, and made it musicall.</br>Thus Psyche at the last, finisht her story</br>Season'd with sharpe griefe, and sweet oratory,</br>Which was as long by her relation made,</br>As might have serv'd to stuffe an Iliade.</br>Such as Aeneas unto Dido told,</br>Full of adventures, strange, and manifold.</br>Her sister by her lookes great joy did show,</br>Resolv'd in that, she did her husband know;</br>And therefore heard her out, with much applause,</br>And gave great heed, but chiefly to that clause</br>Where 'twas declar'd, that he her pompe, and state</br>To one of her owne sisters would translate.</br>Whence gathering, that her selfe might be his bride,</br>She swelld with lust, with envy, and with pride;</br>And in this heate of passion did transcend</br>The Rock, where Zephirus us'd to attend</br>To waft her up and downe, and there call'd on</br>Him, that had now forsooke his station.</br>Yet through the vanity of hope made blind,</br>Though then there blew a contrary wind:</br>Invoking Cupid, that he would receive</br>Her for his spouse, she did her selfe bequeath</br>Unto a fearefull precipice, and threw</br>Her body headlong downe, whose weight it drew</br>Towards the Center; for without support,</br>All heavy matter thither will resort.</br>In this her fall, the hard stones by the way,</br>Did greet her limbes with a discourteous stay:</br>Bruising her in that manner, that she dyed,</br>As if that she her Jury had denyed.</br>Her younger sister missing thus the chiefe</br>Copartner of her sorrows, pin'd for griefe.</br>This craggy rocke did overlook the sea,</br>Where greedy Neptune had eate in a bay,</br>And undermining it, much ground did win,</br>Where silver-footed Thetis, riding in</br>Upon a bridled Dolphin, did explore,</br>And every tyde her armes stretcht on the shore,</br>Searching each creeke, and cranny, to augment</br>The confines of her watry regiment.", "Whilst here she sate within a peerly chaire,</br>And round her all the Sea-gods did repaire,</br>To whom her lawes she did prescribe, by hap,</br>The mangled corps fell full into her lap.</br>Thetis, that once a child her selfe had borne,</br>Seeing so faire a body, fouly torne,</br>And bleeding fresh, judging some ravisher</br>Had done this injury, she did conferre</br>About the cure, and there were many found</br>Whose trade in Surgery, could heale a wound,</br>But none that might restore to life agen.</br>Such was the envy of the gods:  for when</br>The scatter'd limbes of chast Hippolitus,</br>Were re-inspir'd by Aesculapius,</br>And by his Arts command together came,</br>And every bone and joynt put into frame:</br>That none with emulous skill, should dare the like,</br>Jove him to Hell did with his thunder strike.</br>But though she could not by her power controule</br>The Fates decree, to reunite the soule,</br>Into another shape she made it passe,</br>A doctrine held by old Pythagoras:</br>For stripping off her clothes, she made her skin</br>To weare a soft, and plumy coverin.</br>Her grisly nose was hardned to a bill,</br>And at each fingers end grew many a quill.</br>Her armes to pennons turn'd, and she in all</br>Chang'd to a Fowle, which men a Sea-gull call.</br>A Bird of evill nature, and set on</br>Much mischiefe, to whose composition,</br>A great part of her former malice went,</br>And was the principle ingredient.</br>For being thus transfigur'd, straight she swam</br>Into the bottom of the Ocean,</br>Where Neptune kept his Court, and pressing neere</br>To Venus seat, she whisper'd her i' th' eare,</br>How that her sonne lay desperately griev'd,</br>Sicke of a burne he lately had receiv'd,</br>And many by that meanes at her did scoffe,</br>And her whole family was ill spoken off.</br>For whilst that she her selfe, thus liv'd recluse,</br>And he his close adulteries did use:</br>No sport, or pleasure; no delight, or grace,</br>Friendship, nor marriage could find any place.</br>In Love no pledge, no harmony in life,</br>But every where confusion was, and strife.</br>Thus the vile Bird maliciously did prate,</br>And Cupids credit did calumniate.</br>Venus replyd, impatient, and hot,</br>What has my good sonne then a Mistresse got?</br>Which of the Nymphs, or Muses is his joy?</br>Who has inveigled the ingenious Boy?</br>Which of the Howers, or of the Graces all?</br>None of these, said the Bird, but men her call</br>Psyche.  So soone as Venus heard her nam'd,</br>O how with indignation she exclaim'd?</br>What my owne beauties rivall, is it she?</br>That plant, that sucker of my dignity,</br>And I his Bawd?  With these words she ascended</br>To the Seas superficies, where attended</br>Her Doves both ready harnest, up she got,</br>And flew to Paphos in her chariot.</br>The Graces came about her, and in hast</br>What the rough seas, or rude winds had misplac'd,</br>Did recompose with art and studious care,</br>Kembing the Cerule drops from her loose haire:</br>Which dry'd with Rosie powder, they did fold,</br>And bind it round up in a brayd of Gold.</br>These waite about her person still, and passe</br>Their judgement on her, equall with her glasse.</br>These are the onely Criticks, that debate</br>All beauty, and all fashions arbitrate:</br>These temper her Ceruse, and paint, and lim</br>Her face with oyle, and put her in her trim.</br>Twelve other Handmaids clad in white array,</br>Call'd the twelve Houres, and daughters of the day,</br>Did helpe to dresse her:  there were added more,</br>Twelve of the night, whose eyes were shadowed ore</br>With dusky, and black vailes, least Vulcans light,</br>Or vapours should offend their bleared sight,</br>When they her linnen starch, or else prepare.</br>Strong distillations to make her faire.</br>These bring her bathes, and ointments for her eyes,</br>And provide Cordialls, 'gainst she shall arise.</br>These play on Musick, and perfume her bed,</br>And snuffe the Candle, while she lyes to read</br>Her selfe asleepe:  thus all assign'd unto</br>Their severall office, had enough to doe.</br>And had they twenty times as many beene,</br>They all might be imploy'd about the Queene.</br>For though they us'd more reverence, then at prayer,</br>And sate in counsell upon every haire,</br>And every pleat, and posture of her gowne,</br>Giving observance to each frequent frowne.</br>And rather wisht the state disordered were,</br>Then the least implement, that she did weare.</br>As if, of all, that were the greatest sin,</br>And that their fate were fastned to each pin:</br>Though their whole life, and study were to please,</br>Yet such a sullen humour, and disease</br>Raign'd in her curious eyes, she ever saught,</br>And scowling lookt, where she might find a fault,</br>Yet felt she no distemper from the care</br>Of other businesse, nor did any dare</br>To interpose, or put into her mind,</br>A thought of any, either foe, or friend,</br>Receipt, or payment, but they all were bent</br>To place each jewell, and each ornament.</br>And when that she was drest, and all was done,</br>Then she began to thinke upon her sonne,</br>And being absent, spake of him at large,</br>And lay'd strong aggravations to his charge.</br>She ript her wrongs up, how she had past by,</br>In hope of mendment, many an injury:</br>Yet nothing could reclaime his stubborne spleene</br>And wanton loosenesse, though she still had beene</br>Indulgent to him, as they all did know.</br>She talkt to of the duty, children owe</br>Unto their parents, and did much complaine;</br>Since she had bore, and bred him up with paine,</br>Now for requitall, had receiv'd offence;</br>And sorely taxt his disobedience,</br>Then askt the Graces, if they could disclose</br>Where his new haunts were, and his Randevous,</br>For, she had trusted them, to over looke</br>As Guardians, and to guide, as with a hooke</br>His stragling nature, and they had done ill,</br>To slacke their hand, and leave him to his will;</br>Who, as she said, was a weake child, and none</br>Being neere, might soone into much mischiefe run.</br>They blushing smile, and thus alleadg;

none dar'd</br>To be so much of counsell, as to hide,</br>And not reveale, where Cupid did abide.</br>There was an old Nimph of th' Idalian grove,</br>Grand-child to Faune, a Dryad; whom great Jove</br>Had ravisht in her youth, and for a fee,</br>In recompence of her Virginity,</br>Did make Immortall, and with wisedome fill,</br>And her endewed with a Prophetick skill,</br>And knowledge of all Hearbes; she could apply</br>To every greife a perfect remedy,</br>Were it in mind, or body, and was sage,</br>And waighty in her counsell, to aswage</br>Any disease; she had the goverment</br>Of the whole Pallace, and was president</br>Of all the Nimphs, for Venus did commit</br>Such power, to doe; what ever she thought fit.</br>She at that time drest Cupid for his smart,</br>And would have hid his shame with all her heart:</br>But that she fear'd her Mistresse to displease,</br>If it should after chance the Dryades</br>Betray'd her; therefore she durst doe no other,</br>But to send private word unto his Mother,</br>Where her sonne was, and how he hid his head,</br>And groaning lay upon his Mothers bed.</br>Soone as this newes was brought her, Venus went,</br>Blowne with the winde, and her owne discontent.</br>And there began to scold, and rayle, before</br>She did arrive within the chamber dore.</br>Are these things honest, which I heare sayes she,</br>And suiting with our fame and pedegree?</br>Seducing trifler, have you set at large</br>Mine enemy, whom I gave up in charge,</br>That thou shouldst captivate, and set on fire,</br>With sordid, but unquenchable desire?</br>But since; that thou mightst the more stubborn prove,</br>Hast fetter'd her unto thy selfe in love;</br>Seemes you presume, that you are onely he,</br>The Chick of the white Hen, and still must be.</br>And I, by reason of my age, quite done,</br>Cannot conceive, nor beare another sonne.</br>Yes know I can, and for thy more disgrace,</br>I will adopt another in thy place.</br>I'le take away that wicked stuffe, with which</br>Thou dost abuse thy betters, and bewitch</br>Each age, and sexe, and not without delight,</br>Thine Uncle Mars, and thine owne Mother smite.</br>Then burne those armes, which were ordain'd to doe</br>Better exploits, then thou imploy'st them to.</br>For thou wast ever from thy youth untoward,</br>And dost without all reverence, or regard,</br>Provoke thy elders, but Jove, here I wish,</br>I ne're may eate of a celestiall dish:</br>Unlesse I turne this tryumph to offence,</br>This sweet to sower, this sport to penitence.</br>But I thus scorned, wither shall I fly?</br>There is a Matron call'd Sobriety,</br>Whom I have oft offended, through his vaine</br>Luxurious riot, yet I must complaine</br>To her, and at her hands expect the full</br>Of my revenge, she shall his quiver pull,</br>Unhead his arrows, and his Bow unstring;</br>Put out his Torch, and then away it fling.</br>His golden locks with Nectar all imbrewd,</br>Which I from my owne bosome have bedew'd.</br>His various wings, the Raine-bow never yet,</br>Was in such order, nor such colours set:</br>She shall without remorse both cut, and pare,</br>And every feather clip, and every haire.</br>And then, and not till then, it shall suffice,</br>That I have done my wrongs this sacrifice.</br>Thus full of choler, did she Cupid threat,</br>And having eas'd her mind, did backe retreat.</br>But making haste, with this distemper'd looke,</br>Ceres, and Juno both, she overtooke:</br>Who seeing her with such a troubled brow,</br>Did earnestly demand, the manner how</br>She came so vext, and who had power to shrowd</br>Her glorious beauty in so black a clowd.</br>You cannot chuse but heare, Venus reply'd,</br>How I have beene abus'd, on every side.</br>First, when, my limping husband me beset,</br>And caught Mars, and my selfe, both in his net:</br>And then expos'd us naked to the eyes</br>Of Heaven, and the whole bench of Deities.</br>'Tis a knowne tale; and to make up the jest,</br>One god, lesse supercilious then the rest,</br>Told Mars, if those his fetters made him sweat,</br>He would endure the burthen, and the heat.</br>Time wore out this disgrace, but now your art</br>Must drive another sorrow from my heart:</br>And if you love me, use your best of skill,</br>To seeke out Psyche, she hath done this ill.</br>Cupid my sonne, has chose her for his spouse,</br>That is the onely plague vnto my house.</br>Lady, said they, alack what hurt is done,</br>Or crime in this committed by your sonne?</br>Is this a cause, fit to provoke your spight;</br>T' impugne his sports, and hinder his delight?</br>What imputation on your house were layd,</br>Though he should set his fancy on a Maid?</br>You may allow his Patent for to passe,</br>That he may love a blith, and bonny Lasse.</br>What you forget, that he is well in yeeres,</br>And tis a comfort to you, that he beares</br>His age so well;
