["Would you change, my dear TOM, your old mode of proceeding,</br>And make a dull end to a passage worth reading,&mdash;</br>I mean would you learn how to let your wit down,</br>You'd walk some fine morning from Hampstead to town.", "What think you of going by gardens and bowers,</br>Through fields of all colours, refreshed by night showers,&mdash;</br>Some spotted with hay-cocks, some dark with ploughed mould,</br>Some changed by the mower from green to pale gold,&mdash;</br>A scene of ripe sunshine the hedges betwixt,</br>With here and there farm-houses, tree-intermixed,</br>And an air in your face, ever fanning and sweet,</br>And the birds in your ears, and a turf for your feet,&mdash;</br>And then, after all, to encounter a throng of</br>Canal-men, and hod-men, unfit to make song of,</br>Midst ale-houses, puddles, and backs of street-roads,</br>And all sorts of rubbish, and crashing cart-loads,</br>And so on, eye-smarting, and ready to choke,</br>Till you end in hot narrowness, clatter, and smoke!", "'Tis SWIFT after SPENSER, or daylight with candles,</br>A sea-song succeeding a pastoral of Handel's,</br>A step unexpected, that jars one's inside,</br>The shout-raising fall at the end of a slide,</br>A yawn to a kiss, &mdash; a flock followed by dust,</br>The hoop of a beauty seen after her bust,</br>A reckoning, &mdash; a parting, &mdash; a snake in the grass,</br>A time when a man says, \"What!  Come to this pass!\"", "And yet I must say, like a true-tasted Brown,</br>It is only by contrast I quarrel with town;</br>And what may seem odd, though it's equally true,</br>'Tis on this very ground I've a love for it too:</br>For harmony's self is with discord inlaid,</br>And a pleasure must have both it's light and it's shade.</br>Thus I look on the dark side of things as the part</br>That throws out the light  in one's centre, &mdash; the heart.</br>Thus, a battle's strong brushing, &mdash; a scandal will tell:&mdash;</br>For handling, your shoplifter bears off the bell;</br>A fool's clair obscur, &mdash; there's relief in your weeping;&mdash;</br>And trust me, a prison's a fine bit of keeping.", "Then your courtiers, and hirelings, and turn-coats ('od rat 'em!)</br>They too have their their uses; for don't we laugh at 'em?</br>The slang of the Courier, and strut of the Times,</br>What are they but puppets to play to one's rhymes?</br>What's Law, like his bacon, but something to smoke?</br>Or ROSE, on his legs, but an old standing joke?</br>Is'nt BOBBY, the Laureat, as proud of his bay,</br>As his namesake exposing his head in the play?</br>Don't the BOURBONS, whose right comes, like stones, from the sky,</br>Make us too, as well as their countrymen, die?</br>Nay, &mdash; to ask no more questions, &mdash; there's CANNING alone,&mdash;</br>Doesn't he split our sides, who has cut up his own?", "And here let me say (and you'll pardon the stroke,</br>For the Irish blood in me), a laugh is no joke.</br>I can't, for the life of me, find out the brainfuls</br>Of those who are all for the dumps and disdainfuls</br>And when you would put a good thing in their cavity,</br>&mdash;Shake in resistance their hollow-skull'd gravity.</br>&mdash;Men and their follies, they tell us, quite bore 'em:&mdash;</br>Well, laughing's the thing then, of course, to restore 'em.</br>A man, who for sleepiness jolts with his head,</br>Might as well, I conceive, decline going to bed;</br>Refuse to be cur'd, when he's blind of an eye,</br>To ride when he's weary, or drink when he's dry;</br>Or on being invited to dinner, get angry,</br>And say, \"Why, good God, Sir, &mdash; I tell you, I'm hungry.\"", "In this, you'll allow, I bely not my text:&mdash;</br>But enough for the present. &mdash; You'll find in my next,</br>That whether I date from the country, or city, or</br>Any where else, I grow wittier and wittier.</br>Bold talking!  cries somebody, laying me down;&mdash;</br>But an't I your cousin, dear TOM.</br>HARRY BROWN.</br>"]
