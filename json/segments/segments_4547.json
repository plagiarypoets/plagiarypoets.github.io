["Look on that flower &mdash; the daughter of the vale,</br>The Medicean statue of the shade!</br>Her limbs of modest beauty, aspect pale,</br>Are but by her ambrosial breath betray'd.</br>Those half in elegant relief display'd,</br>She standeth to our gaze, half-shrinking shuns&mdash;</br>Folding her green scarf, like a bashful maid,</br>Around to screen her from her suitor suns;</br>Not all her many sweets she lavisheth at once.", "Locked in the twilight of depending boughs,</br>Where night and day commingled, she doth shoot</br>Where nightingales repeat their marriage vows:</br>First by retiring, wins our curious foot,</br>Then charms us by her loveliness to suit</br>Our contemplation to her lonely lot;</br>Her gloom, leaf, blossom, fragrance, form, dispute</br>Which shall attract most belgards to the spot&mdash;</br>And loveliest her array who fain would be forgot.", "Her gloom, the aisle of heavenly solitude,</br>Her flower, the vestal Nun who there abideth;</br>Her breath, that of celestials, meekly woo'd</br>From heaven; her leaf, the holy veil which hideth</br>Her form, with purity resideth.</br>Spring's darling!  Nature's pride the Sylvan Queen!</br>To her, at eve, enamoured Zephyr glideth!</br>Trembling, she bids him waft aside her screen,</br>And to his kisses wakes &mdash; the Flora of the scene.</br>"]
