["At length th' imperious Lord of War</br>Yields to the Fates their ebon car,</br>And frowning quits his toil:</br>Dash'd from his hand the bleeding spear</br>Now deigns a happier form to wear,</br>And peaceful turns the soil.</br>Th' insatiate Furies of his train,</br>Revenge, and Hate, and fell Disdain,</br>With heart of steel, and eyes of fire,</br>Who stain the sword which Honour draws,</br>Who sully Virtue's sacred cause,</br>To Stygian depths retire.</br>Unholy shapes, and shadows drear,</br>The pallid family of Fear,</br>And Rapine, still with shrieks pursued,</br>And meagre Famine's squalid brood</br>Close the dire crew. &mdash; Ye eternal gates, display</br>Your adamantine folds, and shut them from the day!", "For lo, in yonder pregnant skies,</br>On billowy clouds the Goddess lies,</br>Whose presence breathes delight,</br>Whose power th' obsequious Seasons own,</br>And Winter loses half his frown,</br>And half her shades the Night,</br>Soft-smiling PEACE; whom VENUS bore</br>When, tutor'd by th' enchanting lore</br>Of MAIA'S blooming son,</br>She sooth'd the synod of the Gods,</br>Drove Discord from the blest abodes,</br>And JOVE resum'd his throne.</br>Th' attendant Graces gird her round,</br>And sportive Ease, with locks unbound,</br>And every Muse to leisure born,</br>And Plenty, with her twisted horn,</br>While changeful Commerce spreads his loosen'd sails,</br>Blow as ye list, ye winds, the reign of PEACE prevails!", "And lo, to grace that milder reign,</br>And add fresh lustre to the year,</br>Sweet Innocence adorns the train,</br>In form, and features, Albion's heir!</br>A future GEORGE! &mdash; Propitious powers,</br>Ye delegates of Heav'n's high King,</br>Who guide the years, the days, the hours</br>That float on Time's progressive wing,</br>Exert your influence, bid us know</br>From parent worth wht Virtues flow!</br>Be to less happy realms resign'd</br>The Warriour's unrelenting rage,</br>We ask not kings of hero-kind,</br>The storms, and earthquakes of their age,</br>To us be nobler blessings given:</br>O teach us, delegates of Heaven,</br>What mightier bliss from Union springs!</br>Future subjects, future kings,</br>Shall bless the fair example shown,</br>And from our character transcribe their own:</br>\"A people, zealous to obey,</br>A monarch, whose parental sway</br>Despises regal art:</br>His sheild, the laws which guard the land;</br>His sword, each Briton's eager hand;</br>His throne, each Briton's heart.\"</br>"]
