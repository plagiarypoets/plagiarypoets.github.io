["What quick-heaving sighs do I hear,</br>Do they come from yon widowed grove,</br>Where flourish'd the sweets of the year,</br>Where bloom'd ev'ry fragrance of love?</br>Yes, &mdash; these are the sighs of the bow'rs,</br>Who mourn for Thyrsis the gay,</br>Who lament, thro' the slow-pacing hours,</br>The shepherd whom Fate snatch'd away.", "Long labour'd the swain 'neath disease,</br>Nor ever gave one plaintive sigh,</br>Till the pitying pow'rs brought him ease,</br>And wafted him on to the sky:</br>'Tis mine to the dear charmer to mourn,</br>'Tis his to rejoice at the change,</br>In grief I'll oft visit his urn,</br>And among the damp groves will I range.", "At even' how oft have we stray'd,</br>How oft have I fed on his smile?</br>'Twas his my ideas to aid,</br>And moments of sorrow beguile.</br>These shady recesses of yew,</br>The worth of the shepherd can tell,</br>His merit was equall'd by few,</br>On his tongue elocution did dwell.", "Forgot hangs his pipe in the shade,</br>Ne'er tun'd since the dear Thyrsis died,</br>And Music's deserted the glade,</br>Where once ev'ry chorister vied:</br>No more on the flow'r-cover'd green,</br>Do the bare-footed beauties advance,</br>No more are the villagers seen</br>To wind thro' the maze of the dance.", "Sweet ravishing pastime and glee</br>Are chang'd into scenes of despair,</br>Wild wander his flocks o'er the lea,</br>Of no kind protector the care;</br>What an aspect of gloom wear the vales,</br>Where dwelt ev'ry rapture before!</br>All Nature in silence bewails,</br>Since Thyrsis the gay is no more.", "Come, virgins!  we'll join in the lay,</br>And sing to his mem'ry soft strains,</br>We will mourn at each parting day,</br>For Virtue deserted the plains:</br>Nor shall his dear name be forgot;</br>To Thyrsis a garland we'll wear,</br>And strew with fresh flow'rs the spot</br>Where sleep his lov'd relics, each year.", "With the fairies and sylphs in a ring,</br>We'll meet in the moon-lighted grove,</br>There scatter the odours of Spring,</br>&mdash;There join in a concert of love.</br>We'll yearly commem'rate the day,</br>Dread day!  when our Thyrsis expir'd,</br>When fled the fair soul from the clay,</br>And Gaiety, weeping, retir'd.", "On the rind of yon poplar, in verse,</br>I'll record to late ages his fame;</br>The virgins the tale will rehearse,</br>And admire my so gen'rous flame:</br>And should they commend with applause,</br>And repeat thro' the vallies the song,</br>The Muses shall honour the cause,</br>With notes that to sorrow belong.</br>"]
