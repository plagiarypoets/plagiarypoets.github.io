["Where the jessamin sweetens the bower,</br>And cowslips adorn the gay green,</br>And the roses refresh'd by the shower</br>Contribute to brighten the scene,</br>In a cottage-retirement there lives</br>Young Colin and Phoebe the fair,</br>The blessing each other receives,</br>In mutual enjoyment they share.</br>And the lads and the lasses that dwell on the plain,</br>Sing in praise of fair Phoebe and Colin her swain.", "The sweets of contentment supply</br>The splendor and grandeur of pride;</br>No wants can the shepherd annoy,</br>While bless'd with his beautiful bride.</br>He wishes no greater delight</br>Than to tend on the lambkins by day,</br>And return to his Phoebe at night,</br>His innocent toil to repay.</br>And the lads tell the lasses, in hopes to prevail,</br>They're as constant as Colin who lives in the vale.", "If her lover delighted appears,</br>The fair one partakes of his bliss;</br>If dejected, she sooths all his cares,</br>And heals all the pain with a kiss:</br>She despises the artful deceit</br>That is practic'd in city and court,</br>And thinks happiness no where compleat</br>But where shepherds and nymphs do resort.</br>And the lads tell the lasses they die in despair,</br>Unless they are kind as Phoebe the fair.", "Ye swains who're accustom'd to rove,</br>And each innocent fair one betray;</br>No longer be faithless in love,</br>The dictates of honour obey;</br>Ye nymphs who with beauty are blest,</br>With virtue improve every grace,</br>For the charms of the mind, when possest,</br>Will dignify those of the face.</br>And ye lads and ye lasses, whom Hymen has join'd,</br>Like Colin be constant, like Phoebe be kind.</br>"]
