["Eternal Spirit!  mightiest though unknown,</br>Yet seen and felt o'er all the breathing earth;</br>From the dark thunder of thy cloudy throne,</br>To the young zephyr in its hour of birth!</br>Thou smil'st, &mdash; the universe is full of mirth,</br>And nature wantons in those moments bright:</br>Thou frown'st, &mdash; and darkness walks sublimely forth:</br>Thou spread'st abroad thy wings, and solemn night</br>Swathes round a million suns, that trembling hide their light!", "Unsearchable &mdash; unalterable thy ways!</br>The immortal soul but sees of thee a part:</br>No one can tell thy awful length of days,</br>Nor dream of thy departure! &mdash; no:  thou wert</br>Before the worlds were fashion'd, and thou art</br>The same to-day as yesterday; on thee,</br>Time and decay can leave no stain; thy heart</br>Departs not with the pigmy worlds we see,</br>They drop in dust away &mdash; but thou remainest free!", "Bestriding space! &mdash; in darkness thou dost stand</br>In solitary might, holding the spheres</br>Within the hollow of thy dreadful hand;</br>The lightning gems thine awful brow, nor sears:</br>Eternity rolls round thee, but his years</br>Can leave no blight upon thy glorious form,</br>The blast that through infinitude careers</br>The comets spring, launch'd from thy mighty arm,</br>Whilst thou, in glory walks calm o'er the thunder storm!", "Unchanged for ever thou hast been, and still</br>Unsullied &mdash; and unchanged will brightly be;</br>The million, million worlds, but only fill</br>A little speck of thy immensity!</br>Oh!  still this erring world is loved by thee&mdash;</br>Ancient of Days, thy wings are stretch'd as bright</br>As when thy spirit, on Time's jubilee,</br>Dovelike descended from thy holy height,</br>And said to light &mdash; Arise!  and there was life and light.</br>"]
