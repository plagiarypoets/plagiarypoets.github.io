["Once more the vernal sun's all-chearing beams </br>The fields, as with a purple robe, adorn: </br>Thy bloomy banks, O CAM, and glist'ring streams </br>All laugh and sing at mild approach of morn; </br>Thro' the deep groves I hear the chaunting birds, </br>And thro' the clover'd vale the various-lowing herds.", "Up mounts the mower from his lowly thatch, </br>Well pleas'd the progress of the spring to mark, </br>The fragrant breath of breezes pure to catch, </br>And startle from her couch the early lark; </br>More genuine pleasure soothes his tranquil breast, </br>Than high-thron'd kings can boast, in eastern glory drest.", "The pensive poet thro' the green-wood steals, </br>Or treads the willow'd marge of murmuring brook; </br>Or climbs the steep ascent of airy hills; </br>There sits him down beneath a branching oak, </br>Whence various scenes, and prospects wide below, </br>Still teach his musing mind with fancies high to glow.", "But I nor with the day awake to bliss, </br>(Inelegant to me fair nature's face, </br>A blank the beauty of the morning is, </br>And dreary darkness for all for light and grace) </br>Nor bright the sun, nor green the meads appear, </br>Nor colour charms mine eye, nor melody mine ear.", "Me, void of elegance and manners mild, </br>With leaden rod stern Discipline restrains; </br>Stiff Pedantry, of learned Pride the child, </br>My roving genius binds in Gothic chains; </br>Nor more my Muse, by weight of woes opprest,</br>Can whisper to my soul sweet songs of peace and rest.</br>"]
