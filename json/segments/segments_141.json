["A Virgin Princesse and a gentle Lambe,</br>Domb'e both to death to gorge this ugly beast:</br>This valiant victor like a Souldier came,</br>And of his owne accord, without request:</br>With never daunted spirit the Fiend assaild,</br>Preserv'd the Princesse, and the Monster quaild.", "Saint George the figure of our Saviours force,</br>Within the Dragons Jawes his speare hath entred:</br>Whose Sword doth threaten banishing remorce,</br>And hee that on his noble hart hath ventred,</br>Spewes foorth his poison on the sullen ground,</br>And stands in danger of a deadly wound.", "And may my soule, Oh Jesus, speake with zeale,</br>Thy word, thy sword, will Sathans pride consume:</br>So doth thy fathers holy love reveale,</br>And with that beast, all those that dare presume:</br>That peece of wood whereon thy body died,</br>Hath made a mortall passage in his side.", "Saint George the Dragon, Jesus Sathan kild,</br>Saint George the Princesse and the Lambe preserv'd:</br>Jesus his bitter combat hath fulfild,</br>And by the Divels death his Church reserv'd:</br>That spotlesse Dame whose ravishment was sought,</br>By tirants rage that bloody ruine brought.", "Saint Georges Knight renowmed Mountjoy one,</br>Bearing thy Saviours badge within thy breast:</br>Quell that Hells shape of divelish proud Terone,</br>And cover with the dust his stubborne Crest:</br>That our deere Princesse and her land bee safe,</br>Such power to him, Oh Jesus Christ vouchsafe.</br>"]
