["Can a heart that is bursting with grief,</br>Find ease by relating its woe?</br>Can my bosom e'er hope for relief,</br>While my sorrows continue to flow?</br>Alas!  tho' no succour be near,</br>From sighing I cannot refrain;</br>And a tear still enforcing a tear,</br>My eye-lids incessantly strain.", "O!  cou'd I these torments now quit!</br>Cou'd I chase but her form from my mind!</br>But why shou'd I wish to forget</br>That once she was gentle and kind?</br>That fate in the play-day of youth,</br>To my nonage should be so severe,</br>To cause me to love her with truth!</br>To cause me, alas!  to despair!", "Oh!  whence are the moments of bliss</br>We spent where the eglantines grow?</br>Or where the sweet innocent kiss,</br>She then was so kind to bestow?</br>Gone, gone &mdash; I shall prove them no more,</br>With my blossoms of hope are they fled;</br>That hope I was fond to adore!</br>Now blasted, now wither'd, and dead.", "Had she never permitted my praise,</br>When reclin'd on her bosom I hung:</br>Had she never been fond of my lays,</br>Had she never applauded my song:</br>O!  then had my heart been at rest,</br>Which now must for ever endure,</br>An anguish which can't be exprest!</br>An anguish she only can cure.</br>"]
