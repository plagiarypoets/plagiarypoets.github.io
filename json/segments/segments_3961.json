["'Twas in the sweet season of spring,</br>Asleep at the dawn of the day,</br>I dream'd what I cannot but sing,</br>So pleasant it seem'd as I lay.</br>I dream'd, that on ocean afloat,</br>Far West from fair Albion I sail'd,</br>While the billows high lifted the boat,</br>And the fresh-blowing breeze never fail'd.", "In the steerage a Woman I saw,</br>Such, at least, was the form that she wore,</br>Whose beauty impress'd me with awe</br>Ne'er taught me by woman before.</br>She sat, and a shield at her side</br>Shed light, like a Sun on the waves,</br>And smiling divinely, she cried,</br>\"I go to make freemen of slaves.\"", "Then raising her voice to a strain</br>The sweetest that ear ever heard,</br>She sung of the slave's broken chain,</br>Wherever her glory appear'd.</br>Some clouds, which had over us hung</br>Fled chaced by her melody clear,</br>And, methought, while she Liberty sung,</br>It was Liberty only to hear.", "Thus, swiftly dividing the flood,</br>To a slave-cultur'd island we came,</br>Where a Daemon, her enemy, stood,</br>Oppression his terrible name.</br>In his hand, as a sign of his sway,</br>A scourge hung with lashes he bore,</br>And stood looking out for his prey</br>From Africa's sorrowful shore.", "But soon as approaching the land</br>That Goddess-like Woman he view'd,</br>The scourge he let fall from his hand,</br>With blood of his subjects embrued.</br>I saw him both sicken and die,</br>And, the moment the monster expir'd,</br>Heard shouts which ascended the sky</br>From thousands with rapture inspir'd.", "Awakening, how could I but muse</br>On what such a dream might betide?</br>But soon my ear caught the glad news</br>Which serv'd my weak thoughts for a guide,</br>That BRITANNIA, renown'd o'er the waves,</br>For the hatred she ever has shown</br>To the black-scepter'd rulers of slaves,</br>Resolves to have none of her own.</br>"]
