["Harp of the West, that long had lain unwept,</br>All desolate, by Tara's ruin'd wall,</br>While the cold night-dews o'er thy silence wept,</br>And sorrowed at thy melancholy thrall;</br>Thy bondage could not move one heart of all</br>Thy fetter'd, spirit-broken, sons to pour</br>From thy sad chords one note, since Freedom's fall,</br>'Till, starting into life, from shore to shore,</br>Thy witching numbers own'd the inspiring touch of MOORE.", "O, with what ecstasy my bosom thrill'd,</br>When lonely wandering by the placid sea,</br>The else unbroken moonlight calm was fill'd</br>With breathings of thy magic minstrelsy;</br>Not such as echoed in thy noontide glee,</br>'Mid festive boards, or burn'd o'er battle plains&mdash;</br>Nor such, indeed, as when thy sons were free,</br>But sweet and plaintive were those moonlight strains</br>That poured the \"Song of Sorrow\" o'er thy Country's chains!", "Bard of the West!  of Erin's weeping land!</br>Tho' rough and rude the stripling strains that swell</br>To gratulate thee on that native strand,</br>Which thou hast sung, and lovest yet so well;</br>Still do \"I feel the bliss I do not tell,\"</br>When I behold the Patriot in whose songs</br>The name of Erin shall undying dwell&mdash;</br>That Bard to whom th' exclusive task belongs,</br>To exalt his Country's pride, and soothe his Country's wrongs!</br>"]
