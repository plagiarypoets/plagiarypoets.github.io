["The men renown'd as chiefs of human race,</br>And born to lead in counsels or in arms,</br>Have seldom turn'd their feet from glory's chace</br>To dwell with books or court the Muse's charms.</br>Yet, to our eyes if haply time hath brought</br>Some genuine transcript of their calmer thought,</br>There still we own the wise, the great, or good;</br>And Caesar there and Xenophon are seen,</br>As clear in spirit and sublime of mien,</br>As on Pharsalian plains, or by the Assyrian flood.", "Say thou too, Frederic, was not this thy aim?</br>Thy vigils could the student's lamp ingage,</br>Except for this?   except that future fame</br>Might read thy genius in the faithful page?</br>That if hereafter envy shall presume</br>With words irreverent to inscribe thy tomb,</br>And baser weeds upon thy palms to fling,</br>That hence posterity may try thy reign,</br>Assert thy treaties, and thy wars explain,</br>And view in native lights the hero and the king.", "O evil foresight and pernicious care!</br>Wilt thou indeed abide by this appeal?</br>Shall we the lessons of thy pen compare</br>With private honor or with public zeal?</br>Whence then at things divine those darts of scorn?</br>Why are the woes, which virtuous men have borne</br>For sacred truth, a prey to laughter given?</br>What fiend, what foe of nature urg'd thy arm</br>The Almighty of his scepter to disarm?</br>To push this earth adrift and leave it loose from heaven?", "Ye godlike shades of legislators old,</br>Ye who made Rome victorious, Athens wise,</br>Ye first of mortals with the bless'd inroll'd,</br>Say did not horror in your bosoms rise,</br>When thus by impious vanity impell'd</br>A magistrate, a monarch, ye beheld</br>Affronting civil order's holiest bands?</br>Those bands which ye so labor'd to improve?</br>Those hopes and fears of justice from above,</br>Which tam'd the savage world to your divine commands?</br>"]
