["ALBINO.</br>When Virgil thought no Shame the Dorick Reed</br>To tune, and Flocks on Mantuan Plains to feed,</br>With young Augustus Name he grac'd his Song:</br>And Spencer, when amid the rural Throng,</br>He carol'd sweet and graz'd along the Flood</br>Of gentle Thames, made ev'ry sounding Wood</br>With good Elisa's Name to ring around;</br>Elisa's Name on ev'ry Tree was found.", "Since then, O A&mdash; our Cattle thrive,</br>And Swains at ease through ANNA's Goodness live;</br>Like them will I my slender Musick raise,</br>And cause the vocal Vallies speak her Praise:</br>While you some labour'd Poem shall design,</br>And ANNA's Virtues beautifie each Line.</br>But now to you, my Friend, a lowly Lay,</br>While my Kids browze, obscure in Shades I play.", "Two Country Swains, both musical, both young,</br>In Friendship's mutual Bonds united long,</br>Retir'd within a mossy Cave, to shun</br>The Crowd of Shepherds, and the Noon-day Sun:</br>A melancholy Thought possess'd their Mind;</br>Revolving now the solemn Day they find</br>When young Albino dy'd:  his Image dear</br>Bedews their Cheeks with many a trickling Tear;</br>To Tears they add the Tribute of their Verse:</br>These Angelot, those Palin did rehearse.", "ANGELOT.</br>Thus yearly circling by-past Times return;</br>And yearly thus Albino's Fate we mourn:</br>Albino's Fate was early; short his Stay:</br>How sweet the Rose!  how speedy the Decay!", "Can we forget how ev'ry Creature moan'd,</br>And sympathizing Rocks in Echos groan'd,</br>Presaging future Woe, when for our Crimes</br>We lost Albino, Pledge of peaceful Times,</br>The Pride of Britain, and the darling Joy</br>Of all the Plains and ev'ry Shepherd Boy?</br>No joyous Pipe was heard, no Flocks were seen,</br>Nor Shepherds found upon the grassy Green;</br>No Cattel graz'd the Field nor drank the Flood;</br>No Birds were heard to warble thro' the Wood.", "In yonder gloomy Grove stretch'd out he lay,</br>His beauteous Limbs upon the sordid Clay;</br>The Roses on his pallid Cheeks decay'd,</br>And o'er his Lips a livid Hue display'd.</br>Bleating around him lye his pensive Sheep,</br>And mourning Shepherds came in Crowds to weep;</br>The pious Mother comes, with Grief opprest:</br>Ye conscious Trees and Fountains can attest,</br>With what sad Accents and what moving cries</br>She fill'd the Grove, and importun'd the Skies,</br>And ev'ry Star upbraided with his Death,</br>When in her childless Arms, devoid of Breath,</br>She clasp'd her Son:  Nor did the Nymph for this</br>Place in her Darling's Welfare all her Bliss,</br>And teach him young the Sylvan Crook to wield,</br>And rule the peaceful Empire of the Field.", "As milk-white Swans on silver Streams do show,</br>And silver Streams to grace the Meadows flow;</br>As Corn the Vales, and Pines the Hills adorn,</br>So thou to thine an Ornament wast born.</br>Since thou, delicious Youth, didst quit the Plains,</br>Th' ungrateful Ground we till with fruitless Pains;</br>In labour'd Furrows sow the Choice of Wheat,</br>And over empty Sheaves in Harvest sweat:</br>A thin Increase our woolly Substance yields,</br>And Thorns and Thistles overspread the Fields.", "How all our Hopes are fled like Morning Dew!</br>And we but in our Thoughts thy Manhood view.</br>Who now shall teach the pointed Spear to throw,</br>To whirl the Sling, and bend the stubborn Bow?</br>Nor do'st thou live to bless thy Mother's Days,</br>And share the sacred Honours of her Praise;</br>In foreign Fields to purchase endless Fame,</br>And add new Glories to the British Name.</br>O peaceful may thy gentle Spirit rest!</br>And flow'ry Turf lye light upon thy Breast,</br>Nor shrieking Owl nor Bat fly round thy Tomb,</br>Nor mid-night Fairies there to revel come.", "PALIN.</br>No more, mistaken Angelot, complain;</br>Albino lives, and all our Tears are vain:</br>And now the royal Nymph, who bore him, deigns</br>To bless the Fields, and rule the simple Swains;</br>While from above propitious he looks down.</br>For this the convex Skies no longer frown,</br>The Planets shine indulgent on our Isle,</br>And rural Pleasures round about us smile:</br>Hills, Dales and Woods with shrilling Pipes resound,</br>The Boys and Virgins dance with Garlands crown'd,</br>And hail Albino blest!  the Vallies ring</br>Albino blest!  O now, if ever, bring</br>The Laurel green, the smelling Eglantine</br>And tender Branches from the mantling Vine,</br>The dewy Cowslip, that in Meadow grows,</br>The Fountain Violet and Garden Rose;</br>Your Hamlets strew and ev'ry publick Way,</br>And consecrate to Mirth Albino's Day:</br>My self will lavish all my little Store,</br>And deal about the Goblet flowing o'er;</br>Old Moulin there shall harp, young Mico sing,</br>And Cuddy dance the Round amidst the Ring,</br>And Hobbinol his antick Gambols play:</br>To thee these Honours yearly will we pay,</br>When we our shearing Feast and Harvest keep,</br>To speed the Plow, and bless our thriving Sheep.</br>While Mallow Kids and Endive Lambs pursue,</br>While Bees love Thyme, and Locusts sip the Dew,</br>While Birds delight in Woods their Notes to strain,</br>Thy Name and sweet Remembrance shall remain,", "Et puer ipse fuit cantari dignus. &mdash; Virg. Eccl. 6.</br>"]
