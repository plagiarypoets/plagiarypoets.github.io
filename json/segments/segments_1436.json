["It is thanksgiving morn &mdash; 'tis cold and clear;</br>The bells for church ring forth a merry sound;</br>The maidens, in their gaudy winter gear,</br>Rival the many-tinted woods around;</br>The rosy children skip along the ground,</br>Save where the matron reins their eager pace,</br>Pointing to him who with a look profound</br>Moves with his 'people' toward the sacred place</br>Where duly he bestows the manna crumbs of grace.", "Of the deep learning in the schools of yore</br>The reverend pastor hath a golden stock:</br>Yet, with a vain display of useless lore,</br>Or sapless doctrine, never will he mock</br>The better cravings of his simple flock;</br>But faithfully their humble shepherd guides</br>Where streams eternal gush from Calvary's rock;</br>For well he knows, not learning's purest tides</br>Can quench the immortal thirst that in the soul abides.", "The anthem swells; the heart's high thanks are given:</br>Then, mildly as the dews on Hermon fall,</br>Begins the holy minister of heaven.</br>And though not his the burning zeal of Paul,</br>Yet a persuasive power is in his call;</br>So earnest, though so kindly, is his mood,</br>So tenderly he longs to save them all,</br>No bird more fondly flutters o'er her brood,</br>When the dark vulture screams above their native wood.", "\"For all his bounties, dearest charge,\" he cries,</br>\"Your hearts are the best thanks; no more refrain;</br>Your yielded hearts he asks in sacrifice.</br>Almighty Lover!  shalt thou love in vain;</br>And vainly woo thy wand'rers home again?</br>How thy soft mercy with the sinner pleads!</br>Behold!  thy harvest loads the ample plain;</br>And the same goodness lives in all thy deeds,</br>From the least drop of rain, to those that Jesus bleeds.\"", "Much more he spake, with growing ardor fired:</br>Oh that my lay were worthy to record</br>The moving eloquence his theme inspired!</br>For like a free and copious stream outpour'd</br>His love to man and man's indulgent Lord.</br>All were subdued; the stoutest, sternest men,</br>Heart-melted, hung on every precious word:</br>And as he utter'd forth his full amen,</br>A thousand mingling sobs re-echoed it again.", "Behold that ancient house on yonder lawn,</br>Close by whose rustic porch an elm is seen:</br>Lo!  now has past the service of the morn;</br>A joyous group are hastening o'er the green,</br>Led by an aged sire of gracious mien,</br>Whose gay descendants are all met to hold</br>Their glad thanksgiving in that sylvan scene,</br>That once enclosed them in one happy fold,</br>Ere waves of time and change had o'er them roll'd.", "The hospitable doors are open thrown;</br>The bright wood-fire burns cheerly in the hall;</br>And, gathering in, a busy hum makes known</br>The spirit of free mirth that moves them all.</br>There, a youth bears a lovely cousin's call,</br>And flies alertly to unclasp the cloak;</br>And she, the while, with merry laugh lets fall</br>Upon his awkwardness some lively joke,</br>Not pitying the blush her bantering has woke.", "And there the grandam sits, in placid ease,</br>A gentle brightness o'er her features spread:</br>Her children's children cluster round her knees,</br>Or on her bosom fondly rest their head.</br>Oh, happy sight, to see such blossoms shed</br>Their sweet young fragrance o'er such aged tree!</br>How vain to say, that, when short youth has fled,</br>Our dearest of enjoyments cease to be;</br>When hoary eld is loved but the more tenderly.", "And there the manly farmers scan the news;</br>(Strong is their sense, though plain the garb it wears;)</br>Or, while their pipes a lulling smoke diffuse,</br>They look important from their elbow chairs,</br>And gravely ponder on the nation's cares.</br>The matrons of the morning sermon speak,</br>And each its passing excellence declares;</br>While tears of pious rapture, pure and meek,</br>Course in soft beauty down the christian mother's cheek.", "Then, just at one, the full thanksgiving feast,</br>Rich with the bounties of the closing year,</br>Is spread; and, from the greatest to the least,</br>All crowd the table, and enjoy the cheer.</br>The list of dainties will not now appear;</br>Save one I cannot pass unheeded by,</br>One dish, already to the muses dear,</br>One dish, that wakens memory's longing sigh&mdash;</br>The genuine far famed Yankee pumpkin pie.", "Who e'er has seen thee in thy flaky crust</br>Display the yellow richness of thy breast,</br>But, as the sight awoke his keenest gust,</br>Has own'd thee of all cates the choicest, best?</br>Ambrosia were a fool, to thee compared,</br>Even by the ruby hand of Hebe drest:</br>Thee, pumpkin pie, by country maids prepared,</br>With their white rounded arms above the elbow bared.", "Now to the kitchen come a vagrant train,</br>The plenteous fragments of the feast to share.</br>The old lame fiddler wakes a merry strain,</br>For his mull'd cider and his pleasant fare,&mdash;</br>Reclining in that ancient wicker chair.</br>A veteran soldier he, of those proud times</br>When first our freedom's banner kiss'd the air:</br>His battles oft he sings in untaught rhymes,</br>When wakening memory his aged heart sublimes.", "But who is this, whose scarlet cloak has known</br>Full oft the pelting of the winter storm?</br>Through its fringed hood a strong wild face is shown,&mdash;</br>Tall, gaunt, and bent with years, the beldam's form;&mdash;</br>There's none of all these youth with vigor warm,</br>Who dare by slightest word her anger stir.</br>So dark the frown that does her face deform,</br>That half the frighted villagers aver</br>The very de'il himself incarnate is in her.", "Yet now the sybil wears her mildest mood;</br>And round her see the anxious silent band.</br>Falls from her straggling locks the antique hood,</br>As close she peers in that fair maiden's hand,</br>Who scarce the struggles in her heart can stand;&mdash;</br>Affection's strength has made her nature weak;</br>She of her lovely looks hath lost command;</br>The flecker'd red and white within her cheek&mdash;</br>Oh, all her love it doth most eloquently speak!", "Thy doting faith, fond maid, may envied be,</br>And half excused the superstitious art.</br>Now, when the sybil's mystic words to thee</br>The happier fortunes of thy love impart,</br>Thrilling thy soul in its most vital part,</br>How does the throb of inward ecstacy</br>Send the luxuriant blushes from thy heart</br>All o'er thy varying cheek, like some clear sea</br>Where the red morning-glow falls full but tremblingly!", "'Tis evening; and the rural ball begins:</br>The fairy call of music all obey;</br>The circles round domestic hearths grow thin;</br>All, at the joyful signal, hie away</br>To yonder hall with lights and garlands gay.</br>There, with elastic step, young belles are seen</br>Entering, all conscious of their coming sway:</br>Not oft their fancies underrate, I ween,</br>The spoils and glories of this festal scene.", "New England's daughters need not envy those</br>Who in a monarch's court their jewels wear;</br>More lovely they, when but a simple rose</br>Glows through the golden clusters of their hair.</br>Could light of diamonds make her look more fair,</br>Who moves in beauty through the mazy dance,</br>With buoyant feet that seem'd to skim the air,</br>And eyes that speak, in each impassion'd glance,</br>The poetry of youth, love's sweet and short romance?", "He thinks not so, that young enamor'd boy</br>Who through the dance her graceful steps doth guide,</br>While his heart swells with the deep pulse of joy.</br>Oh, no; by nature taught, unlearnt in pride,</br>He sees her in her loveliness array'd,</br>All blushing for the love she cannot hide;</br>And feels that gaudy art could only shade</br>The brightness nature gave to his unrivall'd maid.", "Gay bands, move on; your draught of pleasure quaff;</br>I love to listen to your joyous din;</br>The lad's light joke, the maiden's mellow laugh,</br>And the brisk music of the violin.</br>How blithe to see the sprightly dance begin!</br>Entwining hands, they seem to float along,</br>With native rustic grace that well might win</br>The happiest praises of a sweeter song,</br>From a more gifted lyre than doth to me belong.", "While these enjoy the mirth that suits their years,</br>Round the home-fires their peaceful elders meet.</br>A gentler mirth their friendly converse cheers;</br>And yet, though calm their pleasures, they are sweet</br>Through the cold shadows of the autumn day</br>Oft breaks the sunshine with as genial heat,</br>As o'er the soft and sapphire skies of May,</br>Though nature then be young and exquisitely gay.", "On the white wings of peace their days have flown;</br>Nor wholly were they thrall'd by earthly cares;</br>But from their hearts to heaven's paternal throne</br>Arose the daily incense of their prayers.</br>And now, as low the son of being wears,</br>The God to whom their morning vows were paid,</br>Each grateful offering in remembrance bears,&mdash;</br>And cheering beams of mercy are display'd,</br>To gild with heavenly hopes their evening's pensive shade.", "But now, farewell to thee, thanksgiving day!</br>Thou angel of the year!  one bounteous hand</br>The horn of deep abundance doth display,</br>Raining its rich profusion o'er the land;</br>The other arm, outstretch'd with gesture grand,</br>Pointing its upraised finger to the sky,</br>Doth the warm tribute of our thanks demand</br>For Him, the Father God, who from on high</br>Sheds gleams of purest joy o'er man's dark destiny.</br>"]
