["Now SUMMER, daughter of the Sun,</br>O'er the gay fields comes dancing on,</br>And earth o'erflows with joys;</br>Too long in routs and drawing-rooms,</br>The tasteless hours my fair consumes</br>'Midst folly, flattery, noise.", "Come hear mild ZEPHYR bid the rose</br>Her balmy-breathing buds disclose,</br>Come hear the falling rill,</br>Observe the honey-loaded bee,</br>The beech-embower'd cottage see,</br>Beside yon' sloping hill.", "By health awoke at early morn,</br>We'll brush sweet dews from every thorn,</br>And help unpen the fold;</br>Hence to yon' hollow oak we'll stray,</br>Where dwelt, as village-fables say,</br>An holy DRUID old.", "Come wildly rove thro' desart dales,</br>To listen how lone nightingales</br>In liquid lays complain;</br>Adieu the tender, thrilling note,</br>That pants in MONTICELLI's throat,</br>And HANDEL's stronger strain.", "\"Insipid Pleasures these!  you cry,</br>Must I from dear Assemblies fly,</br>To see rude peasants toil?</br>For Opera's listen to a bird?</br>Shall SYDNEY's fables be preferr'd</br>To my sagacious HOYLE?\"", "O falsly fond of what seems great,</br>Of purple pomp and robes of state,</br>And all life's tinsel glare!</br>Rather with humble violets bind,</br>Or give to wanton in the wind</br>Your length of sable hair.", "Soon as you reach the rural shade,</br>Will MIRTH, the sprightly mountain-maid,</br>Your days and nights attend,</br>She'll bring fantastic SPORT and SONG,</br>Nor CUPID will be absent long,</br>Your true ally and friend.</br>"]
