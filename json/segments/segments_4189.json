["LUCY.</br>Why thus beneath this wither'd cypress shade,</br>All lost in thought, is my Cleora laid?</br>Why does thy tender flock neglected stand,</br>And bleating waits, in vain, thy gentle hand?</br>The fragrant bower, that you so late adorn'd,</br>Now fades and looks as if, for you, it mourn'd;</br>The springing flowers, in your absence, fade,</br>Oh say what sorrows vex the tender breast,</br>Why is Cleora thus with grief opprest?</br>Let us together to yon grotto go,</br>There tell the cause that makes these sorrows flow;</br>The counsel of thy friend may ease thy tears,</br>I'll share thy grief, and try to soothe thy cares.</br>&mdash;The lonely nymphs her mournful silence broke,</br>Rais'd her dejected head, and thus she spoke:&mdash;", "CLEORA.</br>'Tis Damon's loss that causes all my grief,</br>And, in his absence, what can give relief?</br>Let the blue violet and the woodbine fade,</br>And the pale lilly hang its sickly head,</br>The blushing damask rose forget to bloom,</br>And jessamy no more shall shed perfume.</br>What pleasure can the mournful bower boast,</br>Since the dear swain, for whom 'twas rear'd, is lost?</br>Damon, the joy of all the tender maids,</br>The loveliest youth that ever bless'd the shades,</br>Dost thou not know the blooming constant swain,</br>Dost thou not know, that he has left the plain?</br>And canst thou ask me, why I'm thus opprest?</br>Is love a stranger to my Lucy's breast?", "LUCY.</br>My breast with friendship's pleasing fires is warm'd,</br>With treach'rous love can never more be charm'd;</br>Ah, warn'd by me, shun the inconstant sex;</br>True, they may charm, but never fail to vex;</br>Uneasy, restless love our peace destroys,</br>Then surely friendship yields superior joys;</br>No rising doubts, nor jealous cares, molest</br>The nymph that to calm friendship yields her breast.</br>Alternate torment rakes the wounded heart,</br>That yields to love, with never-ending smart;</br>The fickle mind of man for ever strays,</br>Ne'er fix'd to one, but roves a thousand ways.</br>Should some new nymph, with fatal power rise,</br>And fairer seem than you, in Damon's eyes;</br>How would you pine, and, struggling with your chain,</br>Would strive to hate, but always strive in vain;</br>Then, sadly sighing say, I ne'er had griev'd,</br>If, like my Lucy, I had ne'er believ'd.", "CLEORA.</br>But from my Damon I no change can fear;</br>Mild are his manners, and his soul sincere;</br>The love I bear him plays about my heart,</br>A lambent flame that warms, and gives no smart.</br>Tis fix'd as fate, I've no desire to range,</br>Till in my Damon I perceive a change;</br>And should I find it, should the lovely youth</br>Leave me to mourn his vows and broken truth;</br>I'll waste my days in some sad lone retreat,</br>While he is sighing at another's feet;</br>Then, not till then, my Lucy, shall I prove</br>That friendship ought to be preferr'd to love.", "LUCY.</br>Cease the dispute, the silent grotto wears</br>A darker shade, and sable night appears</br>Courting repose &mdash; Here may we make our beds,</br>And on these mossy pillows rest our heads;</br>May the kind Gods our wishes both approve,</br>Bless me with friendship, and bless you with love.</br>"]
