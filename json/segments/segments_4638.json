["Bewailing I heard on the plain</br>A shepherd thus utter his grief;</br>Thou love, cruel love, art my pain,</br>For love I can find no relief.</br>Not Venus begot thee, I know;</br>For Venus is yielding and free,</br>But nurs'd on some mountain's cold brow,</br>A tygress thy mother must be.", "Ah, why hast thou doom'd me to burn</br>For one, who no pity will show?</br>Where nought I can hope in return,</br>Nor dare to complain of my woe.</br>The hills vocal sound, when I sigh,</br>My moan in sad echo repay;</br>Why then is my fair one, ah why!</br>More deaf, more hard-hearted than they?", "In vain flow my numbers to please,</br>And move other nymphs of the plain,</br>When she, who alone can appease</br>My flame, give no ear to the strain.</br>If nought but my passion I own,</br>Of love, or some token express,</br>My converse she flies with a frown,</br>And leaves me the wind to address.", "This kindness of Cupid I crave,</br>If pity his bosom e'er sway'd;</br>To lay me soon down in the grave,</br>Or give to my arms the dear maid.</br>Then, swains, my sad story relate,</br>My lov'd cruel fair when you see,</br>Pray tell her, if death be my fate,</br>That death has more pity than she.</br>"]
