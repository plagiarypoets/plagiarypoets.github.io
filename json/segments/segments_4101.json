["I will fly to some secret retreat,</br>Where sorrow no bosom disturbs;</br>With the boughs I'll entwine me a seat,</br>And my food it shall only be herbs.</br>From a clear limpid stream that runs by,</br>I'll drink when I thirsty am grown;</br>Then stretch'd on the banks I will lye,</br>And unpity'd will make my sad moan.", "With the leaves I'll contrive me a bed</br>Whereon I at night may recline;</br>Tho' no pillow will ease my poor head,</br>Yet I'll make it all gaudy and fine.</br>I'll deck it with shrubs, and with flowers,</br>The sweetest that are to be found;</br>Here pensive I'll pass the still hours,</br>When night draws her curtain around.", "When Aurora enlightens the sky,</br>Thro' the woods and the vales I'll relate,</br>How from Delia's unkindness I fly,</br>And how cruel and hard is my fate.</br>I'll tell how my passion began,</br>How fondly I lov'd, and how true;</br>How she own'd that there ne'er was a man</br>Who for tenderness could me outdo;", "How with transport I sat by her side,</br>And prest her dear hand to my heart;</br>And how oft to my vows she reply'd,</br>That we ne'er from each other would part:</br>How once she could pity my pain,</br>And my fondness with passion return;</br>Yet now smiles on a wealthier swain,</br>Who ne'er with my ardour did burn.", "Tho' fortune to him is more kind,</br>And for grandeur she'll give her consent;</br>Yet perjur'd &mdash; with guilt in her mind,</br>She ne'er can be blest and content.</br>I no more this inconstant shall see,</br>Sequester'd I'll pass all my days;</br>'Tis by death I alone can be free,</br>For Love in my bosom still preys.</br>"]
