["Where stood the bard of old in the high hour</br>When the Muse filled him with her magic power?</br>Not in the hall where revelry and mirth</br>Draws the wrapt soul from thoughts of loftier birth;</br>Not in the bower where notes subdued and clear</br>Be such as win on listening Beauty's ear:</br>Not in the haunts where mingled among men</br>The spirit is lowered to common life again.</br>His step was on the mountain heath when clouds</br>Veiled their grey peaks in fluctuating shrouds:</br>Where the wild cataract brawls along the steep,</br>And the scathed birch trees bend around and weep:</br>And the lone ruin frowns above the flood</br>Black with the horror of impending wood:</br>Where Freedom sits upon her throne sublime,</br>Her altars hallowed from the birth of Time!</br>Then &mdash; while the mossy cairn was on his eye,</br>Rough with the stain of battle-fields gone by:</br>When the low wind was wailing far and shrill,</br>And the grey mist rolled floating round the hill:</br>And the long grass upon the rocky heath</br>Sighed like the Voices of the Dead beneath!</br>Then, while each impulse waked the rising flame,</br>The Celtic Muse, the inspiration came!</br>She came &mdash; and lighted up his aged eye</br>With the decaying flame of ecstacy!</br>And his veins thrilled again with sacred fire,</br>And his hand swept along the sounding lyre:</br>While o'er his tranced sight was darkly shed</br>The long lost shadows of the mighty dead,</br>While their high memory and deathless fame</br>Lived in his heart and kindled through his frame:</br>And the disdain of life, and conscious pride</br>Of spirit by kindred commune deified!", "O marvel not his voice was lofty &mdash; heard</br>Burst o'er the stillness of the breathless board:</br>That grey-haired heroes felt returning pride,</br>That the young burned to pour their heart's full tide,</br>So they might claim when mingled with the brave,</br>The life &mdash; the immortality he gave!</br>Where art thou now?  the halls that echoed high</br>With the applause of thy wild minstrelsy,</br>The very stones that moulded them are gone:</br>The warriors past like meteors that have shone.</br>Their fame was left to thee, and left in vain,</br>For oh, how brief was thy own life and strain!</br>The age when thou didst flourish &mdash; sunk within</br>The abyss of Time as if it had never been!</br>Such shall be ours:  but oh, how blest wert thou</br>In the Bard's name more hallowed far than now;</br>The aged gathered round thy steps and blest</br>The harp that soothed and sanctified their rest!</br>The ear of Beauty listened, and the young</br>On thy high words as on a prophet hung.</br>Wherefore?  they heard the strains of Liberty,</br>That taught them how to live, or greatly die:</br>That breathed the softer virtues, which, apart</br>Dwelt on, were fixed and hallowed in the heart;</br>Our colder, lowlier, meaner themes are won</br>From toil and art &mdash; but thou wert Nature's son!</br>"]
