["Ye shepherds adhere to my woe,</br>And pity the anguish I bear;</br>Oh!  did ye my sorrows but know,</br>Ye surely would greant me a tear!</br>My Phillis, that gladden'd the plain,</br>And formerly gave such delight,</br>Has left me to languish in pain,</br>And banish'd me quite from her sight.", "Ah!  once she was mild as the dove,</br>No nymph was more faithful and free,</br>And I thought her the goddess of love,</br>So sweetly she smil'd upon me:</br>Together, in grove or in mead,</br>Delighted we travers'd along,</br>While around us the herds were at feed,</br>Or we heard the sweet warbler's song.", "But now I am sad and forlorn,</br>My pleasure and pastime is o'er;</br>For Philis rejects me with scorn,</br>And never will think on me more.</br>I met her one day in the dale,</br>And tenderly told her my care,</br>But oh!  she rejected my tale,</br>And bade me go droop and despair!", "She cried, you are fickle in mind,</br>Yet, trust me, I scarce can tell why,</br>And hop'd that some swain she should find,</br>That never would cause her to sigh.</br>With wonder I gaz'd at the maid,</br>For to her I was ever sincere,</br>Yet she frown'd at whatever I said,</br>So faithless, alas!  was my dear.", "Oh!  think, cruel maid, I reply'd,</br>What vows you have proffer'd to me;</br>Then why am I scorn'd and deny'd</br>While thus I'm distracted for thee?</br>Remember, one eve in the grove,</br>With freedom you valu'd my truth;</br>In tears you then plighted your love,</br>And strongly regarded my youth.", "Then why will you leave me to weep,</br>Nor pity the anguish I find?</br>Will Philis her cruelty keep?</br>Ah!  will she be ever unkind?</br>Awhile, oh!  reflect on my woe,</br>Your malice no longer invoke;</br>I'm wretched, you surely must know,</br>And die with so fatal a stroke!", "'Twas thus I unbosom'd my grief,</br>Though fruitless I found was my plea;</br>For still she ne'er gave me relief,</br>Nor longer will smile upon me.</br>Ye shepherds so jocund and gay,</br>Since my charmer will never be won;</br>Oh!  give a kind ear to my lay,</br>And pity a youth that's undone!</br>"]
