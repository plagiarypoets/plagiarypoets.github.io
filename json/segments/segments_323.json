["What John?  What Gower?  John Gower, Chaucers friend?</br>He liv'd; and wrote renow'd in times of yore:</br>And now belike, according to the lore</br>Of great Pythagoras, himselfe doth lend.", "Thus, by Soule-shifting, Virgil's ghost did wend</br>To Spencer's lodge.  Who Ovid was before;</br>Is Drayton since.  Thus Lucan Fates restore</br>In May.  Thus Orpheus soule doth Quarl's attend.", "Let Heralds thee engower when thou wilt brave it:</br>Thy Muse for name; and fame makes Affidavis.</br>"]
