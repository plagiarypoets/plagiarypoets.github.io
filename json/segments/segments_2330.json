["Fie, Shepherd, ingloriously laid,</br>Like an insect that chirps in the grass,</br>Your songs are indulg'd in the shade,</br>While a garland you twine for your lass.", "Vain garland that fades in a day,</br>Cull'd with care, and accepted with pride,</br>War's laurels are lasting as gay,</br>And Britain bids arm on her side.", "Thus the swains who repine at the smile,</br>That Phillis bestows on my song,</br>With prospects more bright would beguile,</br>To persuade me th' employment is wrong.", "Let the soldier preferment pursue,</br>And boast of the scars in his face;</br>Phillis' frowns are the foes I subdue,</br>My triumph is in her embrace.", "What modesty blooms in her looks!</br>What mildness is heard from her tongue!</br>Nor flow'rets so fair by the brooks,</br>No bird-notes so sweetly are sung.", "Like the sun 'tis her fortune to shine,</br>From the blessing I dare not exclude;</br>Tho' the pulse of her bosom is mine,</br>She's obliging to all but the rude.", "Her hair more than ebon I prize;</br>Her neck may compare with the dove;</br>Her wit is as bright as her eyes,</br>And her goodness is pure as my love.", "If the noble her manners disclaim,</br>When the head of the mourner she'd raise,</br>Yet her cheek is a stranger to shame,</br>But she blushes to hear of her praise!", "To fair Phillis I constantly vow,</br>All my songs with her name I repeat;</br>The wreath shall adorn her gay brow,</br>And this verse I will lay at her feet.</br>"]
