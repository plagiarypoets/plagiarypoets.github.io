["Sport!  Harbinger of health, relief from care,</br>Whether enjoyed on mountain, moor, or stream,</br>In dale, in brake, on ocean, or in air,</br>Youths gay pursuit, and Age's pleasing dream,</br>Still, joy-inspiring Sport, thou art my theme!</br>The pensive lamp let poring schoolmen waste,</br>And wake long nights, to earn a vain esteem,</br>While from my heather bed I bound in haste,</br>Roused by the lark, to hail the morn's reviving beam.", "Yet have I known the wisest quench the lamp,</br>Impatient for the sport approaching morn,</br>And bold defiance bid to cold and damp,</br>Dashing the pearly dew-drop from the thorn,</br>To the shrill music of the early horn:</br>Blest union!  wisdom, health, and sport combined,</br>Sly Renard's brush in cap of knowledge worn;</br>Such marvels days of yore recall to mind,</br>Down the swift stream of time irrevocably borne.", "Blythe, at the dawn the sportsman mounts his steed;</br>And hark!  the yelling pack to Cover flies,</br>Eager he sees the waste of Renard's speed,</br>And shouts his triumph when the traitor dies,</br>While Echo to the voice and horn replies.</br>Perchance he joys to hear the heath-cock crow,</br>And mark his ebon plumage glancing rise,</br>To lay with levelled tube his glories low,</br>Or see him spring transfixed like arrow to the skies.", "But now the Sun declines on Auchinfoyle,</br>And one long day of moorland pastime ends&mdash;</br>A various day of pleasure, and of toil:</br>From Shearlings low the evening smoke ascends,</br>And home his way the weary sportsman wends.</br>O!  emblem meet of fragile man's career,</br>Who his vain hours in sport and labour spends;</br>The same, alas!  a day &mdash; a month &mdash; an year:</br>Fate every joy with toil, and disappointment blends.</br>"]
