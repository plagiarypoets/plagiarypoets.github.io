["Oh Earth!  how fair thou art!  With life, with mirth,</br>With freshness, and with glory, teemest thou!</br>Say, was the morn that wak'd thee into birth,</br>Than that which sheds its sunbeams on thee now,</br>Of purer radiance, or of rosier glow?</br>The clear, calm sapphire of the cloudless sky,</br>Noon's glance of splendour, gilding the tall brow</br>Of some heav'n-climbing steep; or, these gone by,</br>The mild controul of eve's benignant majesty;", "The soft, night-wafted fragrance of the grove,</br>The glitt'ring dews which strew the grassy floor,</br>The tender strain of melancholy love,</br>Which some lone chantress of the woods doth pour,</br>When the loud chorus of the day is o'er;&mdash;</br>Oh!  ne'er did Nature offer to the sense</br>Of wayward man a richer, brighter store!</br>How may he rightly prize the gift immense!</br>Earth's loveliness is his, and Heaven's magnificence!", "Oh thou, of sparkling eye and jocund breast!</br>Oh thou, whose prime is yet upon the wing!</br>This is thine hour!  And never hour more blest</br>Did Time upon his glancing current bring;</br>Oh, ere it passes, smite the bounding string!</br>Yea, haste to bid the fleeting present hail!</br>And let thy harp around in echoes fling,</br>Of youth, and life, and joy, th' inspiring tale,</br>One wild thanksgiving hymn o'er ocean, hill, and vale!", "For thou canst feel and taste, thy glance is strong</br>To mingle with the sunbeam!  'Tis thy hour!</br>Thy heart-pulse dances light to every song;</br>Thy ready fingers pluck the springing flow'r,</br>Just as it opens to the genial show'r</br>Its new-born bloom.  Now, even while ye may,</br>While yet the fibres of your heart have pow'r</br>To keep life's mortal weariness at bay,</br>Wait not to-morrow's dawn!
