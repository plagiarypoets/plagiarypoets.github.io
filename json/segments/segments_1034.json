["When first before my youthful eyes,</br>I saw the form of Sylvia move,</br>I gaz'd upon her with surprise,</br>But not one thought had I of love.", "My soul grew fond of fancies vain,</br>Tetchy and froward, nought could please,</br>Yet knew I not what gave me pain,</br>Nor thought it love, but some disease.", "Soon as the beauty of the sky</br>Night had defac'd with pallid hue,</br>Striving to sleep I down should lie,</br>But sleep away far from me flew.", "Instead thereof sad sighs and fears</br>About me cruel watch maintain'd,</br>Forth gush'd th' involuntary tears,</br>And Sorrow then triumphant reign'd.", "If any drop of slumb'ring rest</br>Into my weary soul distill'd,</br>What frightful dreams would then infest!</br>What horrour through my bosom thrill'd!", "Then up I from my bed should start,</br>And all my former grief renew,</br>Think on that image in my heart,</br>And all its heavenly charms review.", "All night a stranger to repose,</br>To ease a stranger all the day,</br>No sports, no company I chose,</br>To Solitude a willing prey.", "Thus car'd I not abroad to spread</br>Youth's plant when in its fairest prime,</br>But let it all neglected, shed</br>Both fruit and flower before its time.", "Alas, should this be love, I cried!</br>Too late the fatal cause I found,</br>In vain each lenient art I tried,</br>Too deep had pierc'd the rankling wound.", "Nor other cure had I for grief,</br>But my hard fortune to deplore,</br>To languish like the fallen leaf,</br>And feed with plaints th' impoison'd sore.", "Thus t'ward the silent grave I pac'd,</br>Thus by degrees decay'd my frame,</br>Till by the long and lingering waste,</br>I like a pined ghost became.</br>"]
