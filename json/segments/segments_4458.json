["Oh!  Chelsea dear!  let not the mournful voice</br>Of unknown song displease thee; rather lend</br>To hapless Edwin's strains</br>A willing, list'ning ear;</br>Yes, sober matron, fain would he repay</br>In part, the comforts which thy town affords;</br>And to thy daughters fair</br>Address the grateful lay;</br>For fair thy daughters are, and kind as fair,</br>And wise as kind, and generous as wise,</br>And sweet as generous,</br>And innocent as sweet.</br>Oft have they wing'd with bliss thine Edwin's hours,</br>When sad reflection else had whelm'd his thoughts,</br>And sorrow's sharpest fangs</br>Were fast'ning on his soul.</br>Yet, through the gentle converse of the fair</br>Prove thus consolatory, wanton fires</br>Ne'er flutter'd in his breast:</br>But friendship's hallow'd warmth,</br>Matur'd to chastest love, inspires each thought.</br>When he is wont to muse upon his fate,</br>He sighs; &mdash; to find that hope</br>Emits no cheering ray,</br>By which he may ascend to Hymen's fane;</br>Unless, inhuman thought!  his recreant mind</br>Consented to involve</br>A partner in his woes.</br>"]
