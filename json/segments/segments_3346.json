["Fond lads, that spend so fast your posting time,</br>(Too posting time, that spends your time as fast)</br>To chant light toyes, or frame some wanton rhyme,</br>Where idle boyes may glut their lustfull taste;</br>Or else with praise to clothe some fleshly slime</br>With virgin roses, and fair lilies chaste:</br>While itching blouds, and youthful eares adore it;</br>But wiser men, and once your selves will most abhorre it.", "But thou, (most neare, most deare) in this of thine</br>Hast prov'd the Muses not to Venus bound;</br>Such as thy matter, such thy Muse divine:</br>Or thou such grace with Mercie's self hast found,</br>That she her self deignes in thy leaves to shine;</br>Or stoll'n from heav'n, thou brought'st this verse to ground,</br>Which frights the nummed soul with fearfull thunder,</br>And soon with honeyed dews thawes it 'twixt joy and wonder.", "Then do not thou malicious tongues esteem;</br>(The glasse, through which an envious eye doth gaze,</br>Can eas'ly make a mole-hill mountain seem)</br>His praise dispraises; his dispraises praise;</br>Enough, if best men best thy labours deem,</br>And to the highest pitch thy merit raise;</br>While all the Muses to thy song decree</br>Victorious Triumph, Triumphant Victorie.</br>"]
