["When stout Achilles heard of Helen's Rape,</br>And what Revenge the States of Greece devis'd;</br>Thinking, by sleight, the fatal Wars to 'scape,</br>In Woman's Weeds himself he then disguis'd:</br>But this Device Ulysses soon did spy,</br>And brought him forth, the Chance of War to try.", "When Spenser saw the Fame was spred so large,</br>Through Fairy-land, of their renowned Queen;</br>Loth that his Muse should take so great a Charge,</br>As in such haughty matter to be seen;</br>To seem a Shepherd, then he made his Choice:</br>But Sidney heard him sing, and knew his Voice.", "And as Ulysses brought fair Thetis' Son </br>From his retired Life, to menage Arms;</br>So Spenser was by Sidney's Speeches won,</br>To blaze her Fame, not fearing future Harms:</br>For well he knew, his Muse would soon be tired</br>In her high Praise, that all the World admired.", "Yet as Achilles in those warlike Frays,</br>Did win the Palm from all the Grecian Peers</br>So Spenser now, to his immortal Praise,</br>Hath won the Laurel quite from all his feers.</br>What though his Task exceed a humane Wit,</br>He is excus'd, sith Sidney thought it fit.</br>"]
