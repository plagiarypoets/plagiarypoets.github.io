["On a bleak part of Ireland's shore, the blast</br>Had wrecked the ship which homewards Usher bore;</br>From it's torn side the learned Archbishop past,</br>And went, the desolate region to explore,</br>If chance should guide him to a friendly door.</br>Much was his wonder &mdash; much his joy to find,</br>A churchman's dwelling near the desart shore;</br>Thither he bent his steps, secure in mind,</br>To meet from brother-priest relief and welcome kind.", "But no!  his hope was vain; the churlish coast</br>Was not more churlish than the man he sought.</br>Of name, or rank, but little prone to boast,</br>The modest prelate had informed him naught;</br>He merely said, that in God's church he taught,</br>As consecrated priest, their common creed;</br>And told the sad mischance which now had brought</br>Him there to ask relief in direful need.</br>\"A priest,\" exclaimed the churl, \"a hopeful priest, indeed.\"", "\"I doubt if thou, unhappy clown, by Heaven</br>Can tell how many the Commandments be.\"</br>\"Nay,\" was the mild reply, \"I count eleven.\"</br>\"Ha!\" quoth the priest, \"a learned divine I see!</br>Tell me th' eleventh &mdash; and then I succour thee.\"</br>\"Obey it, and thou wilt,\" the Archbishop said;</br>\"A new commandment do I give &mdash; 'that ye</br>Love one another.'  Is thy love displayed</br>Refusing thus to me, thy shipwrecked Primate, aid.'\"</br>"]
