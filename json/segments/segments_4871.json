["Sweet Innocence!  whose milder sway</br>E'en Ocean's farthest isles obey;</br>Beneath whose silent moss-grown cell</br>For ever peace, and virtue dwell;</br>Where Hyacinth's eternal bloom</br>And zephyrs waft a rich perfume;</br>Ah!  lead me to thy hallow'd shrine,</br>And make thy pleasures ever mine!</br>Methinks I see the goddess fair,</br>With buskin'd leg and flowing hair,</br>'Mid forests dark, or allies green,</br>Or verdant meads, a busy scene,</br>With modesty that looks behind,</br>And blushes at the rustling wind;</br>Diffusing health, and bliss around,</br>While airs ecstatic swell the sound,</br>Or through the vale sequester'd stray,</br>And brush the morning dew away.</br>Now by the mountain's hoary side,</br>Where woodbines grow in vernal pride,</br>And lifted on her craggy throne,</br>Majestic nature sits alone,</br>Retiring to the close retreat</br>To shun the fervor of the heat;</br>With fawns, and dryads there resort,</br>And keep Arcadia's festive court,</br>While nut-brown nymphs the chorus lead,</br>Light-tripping through the yellow mead,</br>And every hill, and every grove</br>Re-echoes to the voice of love.</br>Oh source of comfort, joy, and fame,</br>Through life's perplexing maze the same,</br>When flow'ry wreaths of spring appear,</br>Or summer wakes the vernal year,</br>Or autumn spreads her golden store,</br>Or winter's billowy tempests roar,</br>Thy gracious influence impart,</br>And fix thy temple near my heart;</br>Be thou my guide, auspicious guest,</br>And rule triumphant in my breast.</br>"]
