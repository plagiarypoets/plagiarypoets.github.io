["For happiness shall I explore</br>Yon structure, of riches the seat?</br>Or cross the smooth green to the door</br>Of Celadon's shady retreat:</br>There health with her roses in bloom,</br>Vermillions the cottager's cheek,</br>Contentment to comfort gives room,</br>In chearfulness rises to speak.", "There center the sweets and the joys,</br>No sorrow, no anguish, or strife</br>The humble retirement annoys,</br>Of nature, the throne and the life;</br>There labour, in undisturb'd rest,</br>Enjoyment soft woos to her arms,</br>While peace sheds her balms on the breast,</br>Expands her Elysium charms.", "Of industry virtuous the roof,</br>Leander in rapture has ey'd;</br>The palace he guess'd was a proof</br>Of care gilded over with pride.</br>In Celadon's rural recess</br>He pictur'd the charms of his heart,</br>There innocence triumph'd to bless</br>In Patty unconscious of art.", "'Twas ev'ning, most calm and serene,</br>The dance was call'd up in the glade,</br>But Patty was not on the green,</br>She sigh'd in the sycamore shade.</br>Leander, the star of his mind</br>He saw as the garland she wove;</br>His pipe and his tabor resign'd</br>Repair'd to the seat of his love.", "With fervor of passion her hand</br>He kiss'd, and demanded the cause</br>Why thus from the gay village band</br>His Patty so mournful withdraws?</br>Her looks wore intelligence fair,</br>They spoke in an eloquent stile,</br>Expressively serv'd to declare</br>Leander might soften his toil,", "Might lavish soft praise on her form,</br>He did, and of Hymen exclaim'd</br>To gentle persuasion soon warm,</br>Ye fair, could young Patty be blam'd?</br>I saw the sweet maid of his joy,</br>Leander, I cry'd, ever hush</br>Each care that her peace would destroy,</br>He bow'd, and she gave me a BLUSH.</br>"]
