["Monarch of the gloomy train!</br>Which haunt the fear-distracted brain;</br>I feel &mdash; I feel, my lab'ring breast,</br>Grim Terror, by the potent spells possess'd:</br>As thy dismal scenes unfold,</br>The flagging stream of life grows cold;</br>My trembling limbs, my bristly hair,</br>My hurried breath, and starting eye,</br>Fix'd, tho' blasted &mdash; all declare,</br>Tremendous power, thy ghastly form is nigh!", "Upborn by thee, amid the darken'd air,</br>Now dimly breaks the boiling deep below;</br>While the livid lightnings glare&mdash;</br>While the raging whirlwinds blow!</br>Hark!  By starts, what mournful cries</br>'Mid the mingled storm arise!</br>Some vessel strikes, with sudden shock,</br>Upon the lurking pointed rock:</br>O mercy!  Hear the dying crew!</br>See how aloft the straining surge they gain!</br>'Tis past &mdash; the dim discover'd fragments view,</br>Snatch'd in wild eddies o'er the fiery main.</br>Their agonizing cries are o'er&mdash;</br>Deep, deep thy sink &mdash; to rise no more.", "Too well that cruel smile I read,</br>Turn'd on the spot, where thousands soon must bleed;</br>Whose bright arms, gleaming from afar,</br>Now swell the savage pomp of war.</br>As array'd, on either hand,</br>Front to front, the squadrons stand;</br>Ere the shrieks of death resound&mdash;</br>Ere thy bit the crimson ground;</br>See grim Havoc, hot from Hell,</br>With all the furies in her train,</br>Hov'ring low, with dire delight,</br>'Twixt the closing ranks of fight;</br>Prepar'd the tide of blood to swell,</br>And scour the groaning plain:</br>Now the thundering peals arise,</br>Vengeful shouts and dying cries;</br>Till Vict'ry waves her purple flag on high,</br>And echoing triumph rends the tortur'd sky.", "'Tis night!  Now o'er the silent field,</br>By the pale moon's light reveal'd,</br>I see thee steal to view the feast of death!</br>To hear the faint expiring groan,</br>The mutter'd prayer, the hollow moan,</br>The parch'd throat gasping hard for breath;</br>Arm'd with a dagger deep imbru'd,</br>While coward Rapine prowls the slippery plain,</br>And giant Slaughter, smear'd with blood,</br>Reclines his weary limbs on heaps of slain!</br>But who is she?  Misfortune's child,</br>With hurried step, and aspect wild,</br>Who hither seems to move?</br>And bending oft, surveys each palid face,</br>As if she wish'd some friend to trace?</br>Alas!  she seeks her love!</br>And lo!  his breathless corpse she spies&mdash;</br>She cannot weep &mdash; swift frenzy lights her eyes,</br>She shrinks, she falls, and on his mangled bosom dies.", "Now waving high, in proud disdain,</br>His broad red pinions o'er the tainted plain,</br>See savage War exulting flies,</br>Wafted on a million's sighs,</br>Where Ambition points the road,</br>Scenting afar new scenes of blood;</br>Yet, wherefore lag yon fiends behind,</br>By earth acurst &mdash; by life abhorr'd&mdash;</br>Wheeling, like vultures, on the infected wind,</br>Dreadful followers of the sword?</br>Famine and pestilence!  I know you now,</br>The country's blasted as you tread;</br>The groaning city's chok'd with dead,</br>Your horrid work's complete!</br>No face is seen, no sounds arise,</br>Save where some wretch infected flies,</br>And screams along the empty street!", "Grim power!  O spare my aching sight,</br>Nor call thy foul unreal train to light,</br>By Superstition formed of old,</br>In sickly Fancy's giant mold!</br>Yet, lo!  they come &mdash; along the midnight air</br>What spectres dire in wild confusion sweep?</br>See by yon dim and dismal glare,</br>At once thy sink into the yawning deep;</br>While faintly from the gulf below,</br>Rise the shrieks of tortur'd woe!", "Now deep within the tangled dell,</br>I hear the wisard's mutter'd spell:</br>Round him flit a ghastly brood&mdash;</br>The setting moon is turn'd to blood!</br>Prompt his orders to perform,</br>Rush the spirits of the storm;</br>Pitchy darkness veils the skies&mdash;</br>Piping loud the winds arise.</br>Hark!  They howl along the heath,</br>While the fiends, with mournful yell,</br>To the benighted wretch fortel,</br>Scenes of woe and death!", "The storm is past!  And o'er yon mould'ring tow'r</br>Steals through yon sable clouds a silv'ry beam:</br>Avaunt!  Thou visionary power,</br>Nor lead me to the haunted stream,</br>That laves its ivy'd walls.</br>In vain &mdash; its gloomy paths I tread;&mdash;</br>What horrid phantom now my sight appals?</br>From the green pavement bursts the shrouded dead;</br>A clear blue flame conducts it through the gloom,</br>'Mid broken ruins to the fatal room;</br>And now it points the blood stain'd bed!</br>&mdash;The firm-built turret shakes, with dismal sound,</br>'Mid lonely courts that spread their echoes round;</br>The iron clank of chains I hear,</br>While shrieks of torture swell more near.</br>Scarce the crazy boards uphold</br>The armed spectres that advance;</br>While one behind, of horrid mold,</br>Impels them with his fiery barbed lance;</br>And oft, transfixing each, in fury, cries,</br>\"Thus, every hour, the guilty murd'rer dies!\"", "Fearful yawns the dark profound!</br>Muttering thunders heave the ground!</br>Down, through her riven entrails, lo!  we sweep,</br>'Till a dim distant light just glimmers from the deep.</br>Behold the damned crew&mdash;</br>O'er the furnace blue;</br>By the brimstone's livid flame,</br>Doing \"a deed without a name:\"</br>Around them heavier hangs the cavern'd gloom:</br>While summon'd to foretel</br>The dark designs of hell;</br>In accents dread the monstrous throng,</br>Chaunt the strange prophetic song,</br>And write, in blood, the fated warrior's doom.</br>"]
