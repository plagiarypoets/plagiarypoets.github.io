["Awake, my Muse!  awake the lyre!</br>O, animate the sacred strain!</br>Let not a thought of earth remain,</br>To check thy warmth, or damp thy fond desire:</br>To Virtue all thy strains belong;</br>'Tis she, bright goddess, claims thy song.</br>My bosom glows with wild poetic fires:</br>Fair Virtue's praise I sing; she hears me, and inspires.", "Hail, goddess of majestic mien!</br>I know thee by thy snowy vest,</br>A flaming sun upon thy breast,</br>Thy adamantine zone, and brow serene;</br>I view thee bending o'er some rock,</br>Undaunted at the mighty shock</br>Of ruffian waves, that strike the soul with dread,</br>Or the fell storm that howls and bursts around thy head.", "And see!  a heavenly form appears,</br>Of pious mien, calm and resign'd,</br>Amidst the tempest-ruling wind,</br>Of paly hue, and pleasing youthful years;</br>Who, while the waves the skies deform,</br>Seems unconcern'd amidst the storm;</br>With uprais'd eye, on Heaven alone intent,</br>A smile upon her face of sweetest ravishment.", "'Tis Hope divinely fair that smiles;</br>Oft does she turn the volume o'er,</br>The guide when time shall be no more,</br>And points the page that Virtue's pain beguiles:</br>And, lo!  the storm is hush'd again:</br>The winds no more deface the main;</br>The glorious orb of day doth mildly shine,</br>And Virtue pours the strain, and hails the Power divine.", "Mortals, attend the muses song!</br>On Virtue trust alone for aid:</br>When under sorrow's baleful shade,</br>Virtue will bless, and Hope the bliss prolong.</br>Think that the Power Almighty hears</br>Your suppliant prayers, and still your fears;</br>Angels shall minister with fondest love:</br>Resign'd, then, meet the stroke, and bless the Power above.</br>"]
