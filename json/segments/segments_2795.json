["Avaunt, the smile of youthful folly,</br>Since life hath lost all charms for me;</br>Come sullen melancholy,</br>And come thou dark Despondency.", "How rugged is the black brown brow</br>Of midnight horror glooming drear;</br>With shagged locks impending low,</br>O'er deadly nightshade blooming near.", "How fitted for desponding fate,</br>Yon wildly winding walks along;</br>Or seeking thro' the church-yard late,</br>The hoary moss-grown graves among.", "Yon Widow lately pass'd them through,</br>With tear-worn eye and palid look;</br>With dark despair she's sinking low,</br>By yonder willow of the brook.", "To her no charms the dimpling stream,</br>Where once the smiling man she pass'd;</br>All, all is fled!  and like a dream,</br>And all thy hopes with sorrow dash'd.", "Still, still she views the chearless wave,</br>The wave relentless was to thee;</br>For low she lies in her wet grave,</br>All under the willow tree.</br>"]
