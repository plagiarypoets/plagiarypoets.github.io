["Alas!  I am sick and dismay'd,</br>With grief I could lie down and die;</br>My Phillis, dear angelic maid,</br>Has left me to mourn and to sigh.</br>Now, ye shepherds, no longer I join,</br>In the pleasures and sports of the plain;</br>The dance I must henceforth resign,</br>Till my Phillida mix in the train.", "Oh can ye remember that hour</br>When my Phill so applauded my song?</br>How contented we sat in the bow'r,</br>And my music she strove to prolong.</br>Ah chide me not, tho' I relate</br>Those joys I esteemed so dear;</br>Ah chide me not, tho' at my fate</br>I cannot help shedding a tear.", "How sweetly my time was once spent,</br>When summer was quite in its prime;</br>To the groves and the gardens I went,</br>Pick'd flow'rets, and drest them in rhyme.</br>For whenever a wreath I'd prepare,</br>I would always a sonnet compile;</br>Then to Phillis the trophy I'd bear,</br>And she always vouchsaf'd me a smile.", "But blossoms of sweetest perfume</br>With her breath &mdash; no, I durst not compare;</br>They may boast of their fairness and bloom,</br>But my love is more blooming and fair.</br>The mildness that dwells in her face,</br>Well bespeaks the sweet worth of her mind</br>But I'm ready to die in the place,</br>Fearing absence might make her unkind.", "But why do I grieve and repine?</br>She bade me repine not nor grieve,</br>When I ask'd her consent to be mine,</br>To my soul oh what hope did she give!</br>She was sorry, she said, I possest</br>The most trivial doubt of her truth;</br>She bade my poor heart be at rest,</br>For she lov'd me, and no other youth.", "Oh then let me banish despair,</br>And invite chearful hope to my soul;</br>In my favour since Phil does declare,</br>There is nothing besides can controul.</br>Now my bosom of torture I'll clear,</br>Pinion'd time will fly swiftly away;</br>Ere 'tis long I shall visit my dear,</br>And my love with her own she'll repay.</br>"]
