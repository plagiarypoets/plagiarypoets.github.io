["Here Rosamond, (ah!  such is Beauty's doom)</br>Tho' once she shone with more than angel's face,</br>Laid low within the dusky Charnel's gloom,</br>With her sweet name the rugged wall doth grace;", "Loos'd by the wintry wind and driving rain,</br>Here stones disjointed seem to hang in air;</br>Fall'n is the gate, which ne'er shall close again,</br>No more the prison of the cloister'd Fair.", "Deep is the darksome valley's lone retreat,</br>Where once to peace and their own God resign'd,</br>Religious virgin handmaids chose their seat,</br>Which well might awe the serious pious mind.", "Here, in the late slow hours of waining night,</br>Full oft from far the traveller doth spy</br>The secret taper's levell'd stream of light,</br>Steal through the crevic'd windows arch'd on high.", "The midnight bell, at whose accustom'd sound,</br>With pine and fasting pale, with watchings worn,</br>Each maiden trac'd the lonely cloysters round,</br>Oft wak'd the sleeping lark before 'twas morn.", "Fled are those days upon the wing of time:</br>Now here and there with damp and moss o'ergrown,</br>Moulders the fretted aile and roof sublime,</br>The massy buttress and the pile o'erthrown.", "The heifer plucks the ivy from the wall:</br>Fall'n Godstow, is the glory of they dome!</br>Weep, stranger, as thou passest, weep its fall,</br>And strew a flow'r on Rosamonda's tomb.</br>"]
