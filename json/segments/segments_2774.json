["Hail, pensive virgin!  ever hail!</br>Oft have I met thee in the vale,</br>And oft inscrib'd a song to thee,</br>When musing near yon aged tree:</br>Nor serious, silent Solitude</br>Did'st thou despise my numbers rude.</br>Remote from man, in shady dell,</br>Thou heard'st the loud funereal bell,</br>Or from the thronged city far,</br>At evening counts each little star;</br>Or by the pale moon's silver light,</br>O'er hill and forest takes thy flight.", "Sweet nun, who haunts the lonely lane,</br>Teach me that life is short and vain,</br>That grandeur, pageantry, and power,</br>Will vanish at death's dread hour,</br>That beauty's roses soon decay,</br>Like odoriferous flowers in May,</br>Teach me to weep for others woe,</br>O cause the tender tear to flow!", "Fair woodland nymph!  when all is still</br>Thou climb'st the high adjacent hill,</br>And oft by Thames's rushy side,</br>Delights to hear the smooth wave glide;</br>Sister of peace and piety,</br>Sweet nun, I long to visit thee.</br>"]
