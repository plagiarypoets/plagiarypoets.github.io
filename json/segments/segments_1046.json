["TIME &mdash; EVENING.</br>Goddess of Nature!  source of ev'ry joy</br>That nobly agitates the frame of man,</br>But not of those that flatter and destroy,</br>Accept the song that from thyself began!</br>At Russel's tomb unceasingly I mourn,</br>And pour to thee that hymn that echoes from his urn!", "Thy hands, perhaps, in some romantic dell,</br>Where Nature reigns, all beautifully wild;</br>Beneath the craggy mountain's awful swell,</br>A pious trophy to his name have pil'd:</br>Where oft, when sails the breezy morn along,</br>Thou join'st the warbling woods in harmony of song.", "And where, again, at Evening's solemn hour,</br>What time the Moon her silver chariot rears,</br>While Philomela, from her lonely bow'r,</br>Pours the sad notes that call the willing tears,</br>Thou lov'st upon the  closing flowrs to lay thy head,</br>Rapt in sweet dreams of him for whom those tears are shed.", "Oh!  leave thy woods!  nor, at my pray'r, refuse</br>To tread with me a more than midnight gloom;</br>And, as the worm his silent work pursued,</br>We'll pause to view the triumphs of the tomb,</br>Where Death's stern king in sullen horrors reigns,</br>Breathing black starless night o'er Russel's lov'd remains.", "Fear not to come! &mdash; oh!  turn not thus away!</br>No polish'd fiend allures thee to his arms,</br>With democratic voice to urge thy stay,</br>And teach the crowd to idolize thy charms;</br>The while his minions, as they play around,</br>Securely fix their chains, and drag thee to the ground.", "Here sleeps thy son &mdash; thy great, thy glorious son,</br>Who, taught by thee, the paths of virtue trod:</br>He won the prize before his race was run,</br>And left his country to behold his God:</br>And where thy Russel sleeps, Vice dares not come,</br>But hides her blushing face, and rushes by his tomb.</br>"]
