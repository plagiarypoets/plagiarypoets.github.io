["He said, on the banks by the stream,</br>He had pip'd for the Shepherds too long;</br>But, oh!  how delightful his theme,</br>For innocence brighten'd his song!</br>Then how could he wish to rehearse</br>Such lessons so lofty and wide?</br>When Phillis was fond of his verse,</br>And nature sate down by his side?", "Ah!  Colin, who could you mistake,</br>'Till Pan bid you stick to your strain?</br>Could you leave the white swans on the lake,</br>Or quite the delight of the plain?</br>Oh!  no, honest Colin, you found</br>No flame like your Phillis's praise,</br>And poets came creeping around</br>To listen, and envy your lays.", "But vain were their efforts to try</br>To copy thy soft, soothing strains;</br>Their skill they were wont to deny,</br>As a wretched reward for their pains.</br>Yes, Colin, thy music was sweet,</br>With melody glided along,</br>While primroses bloom'd at thy feet,</br>And Shepherds stood by in a throng.", "The nymphs too came flocking the while</br>From their cots, where they dwelt in the dale,</br>And each of them seemed to smile</br>At the joys they receiv'd from the tale:</br>But now you have bid them adieu!</br>Death has seiz'd you a victim, away,</br>While in sorrow they long wish for you,</br>And weep wheresoever they stray!</br>"]
