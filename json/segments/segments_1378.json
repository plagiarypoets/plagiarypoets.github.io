["Where long, long vallies of eternal ice,</br>Within the hollows of the mountain gleam;</br>And, glaz'd with frost, the shaggy precipice</br>Hangs o'er the dashing of the torrent-stream</br>That spreads its foam, then far beneath the beam</br>Of the pale sun, deep frets its cavern'd way;</br>Here the Swiss wooes his pine-woods, tho' they seem</br>To darken their brown foliage, and display</br>Their cones, in sullen pomp, to the dim-struggling day.", "Here, if a wanderer, as array'd in light</br>Sudden a glaciere meets his charmed eyes,</br>Muse on the congelation, glittering bright,</br>Or tinctur'd with the rainbow's transient dyes;</br>Sudden, the surges of the vapour rise</br>O'er all the illumin'd landskape's beauteous glow:</br>And, shivering 'mid the horrour of the skies,</br>He marks immeasurable tracts of snow,</br>Shook by the wrathful roar of clouds that burst below.", "And see the lonely traveller's weary feet</br>Pursue his path along the mountain's side:</br>His burning cheeks are pierc'd by arrowy sleet,</br>Slow as he climbs where ruins threaten wide.</br>But lo!  his smoking cot at length descry'd</br>He fondly picture's the parental kiss,</br>Quickening his eager pace &mdash; when strait divide</br>The snows in hollow thunder! &mdash; scarce the abyss</br>He 'scapes, once more to taste the dear domestic bliss!", "Yet the Swiss loves his chasmy-fractur'd steep;</br>Yet loves his dusky woods, tho' cold and drear,</br>And the rough roads that round his mountain sweep:</br>Yet, as the sombrous torrents soothe his ear,</br>Wild-hanging o'er the craggy point, how dear</br>His simple hut!  'Tis there he breasts the gale,</br>Furrowing his fields; nor, 'mid his genial cheer,</br>Heeds, tho' high floods the mountain-base assail,</br>The enormous mass of snow that overwhelms the vale.</br>"]
