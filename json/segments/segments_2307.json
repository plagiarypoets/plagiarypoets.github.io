["Were I, Paul Jones, dear maid, \"the king of sea,\"</br>I find such merit in thy virgin song,</br>A coral crown with bays I'd give to thee,</br>A car which on the waves should smoothly glide along:</br>The Nereides all about thy side should wait,</br>And gladly sing in triumph of thy state</br>\"Vivat, vivat, the happy virigin muse!</br>Of liberty the friend, who tyrant power pursues!\"", "Or, happier lot!  were fair Columbia free</br>From British tyranny &mdash; and youth still mine,</br>I'd tell a tender tale to one like thee</br>With artless looks and breast as pure as thine.</br>If she approved my flame, distrust apart,</br>Like faithful turtles, we'd have but one heart:</br>Together then we'd tune the silver lyre,</br>As love or sacred freedom should our lays inspire.", "But since, alas!  the rage of war prevails,</br>And cruel Britons desolate our land,</br>For freedom still I spread my willing sails,</br>My unsheath'd sword my injured country shall command.</br>Go on, bright maid!  the muses all attend</br>Genius like thine, and wish to be its friend.</br>Trust not, although conveyed through this poor shift,</br>My New-Year's-thoughts are grateful for thy gift.</br>"]
