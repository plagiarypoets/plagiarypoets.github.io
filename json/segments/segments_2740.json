["Fly, Indifference, hated maid,</br>Seek Spitsbergen's horrid shade,</br>Where old Winter keeps his court,</br>There, fit guest, do thou resort,</br>And thy frosty breast repose</br>Amidst congenial ice and snows.</br>There reside, insipid maid,</br>But ne'er infect my Emma's head.", "Or else seek the cloiser's pale,</br>Where reluctant virgins veil,</br>In the corner of whose heart</br>Earth with heaven still keeps a part;</br>There thy fullest influence shower,</br>Free poor grace from passion's power;</br>Give fond Eloisa rest,</br>But shun, oh shun my Emma's breast.", "Or on Lyce, wanton maid,</br>Be thy chilling finger laid;</br>Quench the frolic beam that flies</br>From her bright, fantastic eyes;</br>Teach the sweet coquette to know</br>Heart of ice in breast of snow;</br>Give peace to her, give peace to me,</br>But leave, oh leave my Emma free.", "But if thou, in grave disguise,</br>Seek'st to make that nymph thy prize;</br>If that nymph, deceiv'd by thee,</br>Listens to thy sophistry;</br>If she courts thy cold embraces,</br>And to thee resigns her graces;</br>What, alas!  is left for me,</br>But to fly, myself, to thee?</br>"]
