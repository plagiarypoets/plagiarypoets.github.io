["The pageantry of courts, the pomp of kings,</br>And all the world calls wealthy, great, and fair,</br>I scorn, but chiefly those ignoble things</br>Who breathe in base subservience courtly air;</br>Who fawn, and kneel, and creep, and laugh, and cry,</br>As wills the prince his pleasure to declare:</br>Out!  out!  ye sycophants, begone, fly!  fly!</br>Ye bear no image of the Deity.", "I come not here in falsehood's hollow train,</br>To pamper courtly luxury and pride,</br>With polished compliments to wake the strain,</br>And praise a mortal whom the good deride:</br>Far other duties on the Laureate fall,</br>To censure, where all decency's defied;</br>To preach of temperance at virtue's call,</br>And to their proper selves the wandering senses call!</br>"]
