["Go spare me, ye shepherds, awhile,</br>Nor tempt me no more to be glad;</br>You cannot my sorrows beguile,</br>For never was shepherd more sad:</br>The woodbines that hang o'er the bank,</br>For cypress and willow I'll change;</br>I'll give you my pipe and my crook,</br>But leave me, O!  leave me to range.", "I see your eyes big with a tear,</br>Which kindly you combat to hide;</br>You always to Strephon was dear,</br>But sorrow and Strephon's ally'd:</br>Scarce dry'd was the cheek (I may sing)</br>That late for my Florimel mourn'd:</br>When death cropt the hopes of the spring,</br>And Philida never return'd.", "'Tis Philida's loss we deplore,</br>The lonely, the blooming, the gay!</br>Alas!  shall the charms be no more,</br>That clos'd e'er the noon of the day?</br>So flush'd with the beauties of morn,</br>The rose sheds its fragrance around;</br>E'er eve, O!  how hard to be born!</br>Its honours lay strew'd on the ground.", "When late as we follow'd the bier,</br>How solemnly sad was the scene?</br>Not an eye but was wet with a tear,</br>For O!  she was lov'd on the green!</br>The nymphs and the swains from her grave</br>All seem'd with reluctance to part;</br>But heav'n its measures will have,</br>And best can reward our desert.</br>"]
