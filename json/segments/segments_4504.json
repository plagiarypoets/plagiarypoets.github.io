["To look upon a Work of rare Device,</br>The which a Workman setteth out to view,</br>And not to yield it the deserved Price</br>That unto such a Workmanship is due,</br>Doth either prove the Judgment to be naught,</br>Or else doth shew a Mind with Envy fraught.", "To labour to commend a piece of Work,</br>Which no Man goes about to discommend,</br>Would raise a jealous Doubt, that there did lurk</br>Some secret Doubt, whereto the Praise did tend.</br>For when Men know the Goodness of the Wine,</br>'Tis needless for the Hoast to have a Sign.", "Thus then to shew my Judgment to be such</br>As can discern, of Colours black and white,</br>As als to free my Mind from Envies such,</br>That never gives to any Man his right;</br>I here pronounce this Workmanship is such,</br>As that no Pen can set it forth too much.", "And thus I hang a Garland at the Dore,</br>Not for to shew the goodness of the Ware:</br>But such hath been the Custom heretofore,</br>And Customs very hardly broken are.</br>And when your Taste shall tell you this is true,</br>Then look you give your Host his utmost Due.</br>"]
