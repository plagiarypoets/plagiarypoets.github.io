the cooling of the breathing winde,</br>Whereby this Element is oft refin'de,</br>And man, and beast, and every thing that liv's,</br>Is nourished by the temperature it giv's.</br>And Wormes abandoned from budding trees,</br>And extreme heate, allayed by degrees.</br>Thus was this splendent Ayrie Element,</br>Placed by Pan with perfect Complement,</br>Distinguished into Regions three,</br>As

Element,</br>Which doth inflame with heate that Regiment</br>The Meteors to the Ayre destinated,</br>Are simply windes, and Earth-quakes nominated</br>Included in a vapor others there be,</br>Which yet are Meteors in their degree.</br>As stormes, and whirl-windes, and the mightie Thunder,</br>Rumbling as if heaven would cleave a sunder.</br>Windes are vapors included in a Cave,</br>Whence by Phoebus force they issue have;</br>And drawne by heate to the mid Region,</br>(Which is all colde by constitution)</br>There they would enter, but being expelled,</br>To be dispersed they are compelled.</br>To everie part of this our lower ayer,</br>Whereby they purge it, And make it soe fayer.</br>All Merchants and Saylers are highly bound,</br>To the time when first this Meteor was

the withered, and parched plaine:</br>The scorched-grasse, on the loftie Mountaine,</br>Reviv's it selfe and getteth life againe.</br>For if this watry clowde should whollie fall,</br>The weight would destroy and over-whelme all.</br>These are not winds of monstrous generation,</br>But naturall windes of gentle inclination.</br>The earth-quake is a simple Meteor,</br>Ayrie and uncompounded as before;</br>An Ayrie vapor, closed in some den,</br>Or concave of the earth, remote from men,</br>Serching for an issue, and finding none,</br>Beateth up and downe, seeking to be gone,</br>But all in vayne, then being fast enclosed,</br>It shak's the earthe in searching to be losed.</br>This is the cause of great Tellus trembling</br>(A man in a shaking Fever resembling)</br>What future events it doth prognosticate,</br>I will not presage, th' effect is intricate.</br>But if a smale vapor be of that power,</br>To shake the whole frame of the earth in one houre,</br>How may proud man full of

Element,</br>Gathered togither from the Continent;</br>Into one vaste-roome, station and place;</br>Leaving faire Tellus with unvailed face,</br>Drie and unmantled, without viriditie,</br>Hard and solide without humiditie.</br>Then gan the mountaines of Armenia,</br>Burning Tartarus, Aetna in Sycillia,</br>Sacred Olympus, Parnassus Crowned</br>By the Muses, Hermon renowned,</br>Tabor, Horeb, ever blessed Syon,</br>Sometime Jehovah's habitation.</br>All rocks and hilles though they were farre distant,</br>Appeared eminently at one instant.</br>The Dales and Plaines, and barren

apparelled;</br>Naked therefore and void of Ornament,</br>Pan discovereth this earthly Element.</br>And these huge waters he divided so,</br>That some in Clowds above th' earth should go,</br>That with distilling drops of moystning raine,</br>Might comfort Tellus parched face againe.</br>The rest might keepe their perfect station,</br>T' ingender fish, and further navigation:</br>He made it of

twise,</br>Impossible therefore to be overflowen with ice.</br>The cause of this swift agitation,</br>Is mightie Phaebes alteration,</br>For as she wanes, or doth in light encrease,</br>So doth the Sea her floods augment, or cease.</br>The cause of her saltnesse is by accident,</br>Of Phoebus piercing beames so vehement.</br>Bringing from the Seas foundation,</br>Drie vapours which by inflamation:</br>Are burn'd to salt by the heate of the Sunne,</br>And hence the saltnesse of the Sea begunne;</br>For waters themselves have no savour at all,</br>But as it comes by cause accidentall.</br>Hence are ingendred moyst Meteors,</br>Almightie Jovah's strong Ambassadors,</br>The Mist, the Deaw, the Frost, the hollow Clowd,</br>That doth the Elementall vapors shrowd.</br>The Raine, the Snow, the fearefull Haile, the Sleete,</br>Wherewith in Februarie or March we meete.</br>The Sleete can never in the Summer fall,</br>For then the middle Region's coldst of all,</br>The Mist is a vapour which all men knowe</br>And doth of watrie Exhalations growe,</br>If it ascendeth before it doth raine,</br>Of much Raine it is a token certaine,</br>But if it doth rise when shower is ended,</br>Fowle weather's gone, and th' aire amended,</br>It is the matter also of the falling Dewe,</br>Which doth the face of great Flora renewe.</br>And if this vapour be foggie and

thinne,</br>Then shall the sweete Deawes, or sharpe Frosts begin.</br>But in Summer, Deaw:  in Winter the Frost,</br>Do follow the myst in everie coast.</br>The cause of the Deaw as Shepherds do finde,</br>Is Luke-warme breathing of the Southern winde.</br>The cause that hindereth the Deaws generation,</br>Is the Northren winds cold inflation,</br>The aptest times for the Deaw to abound,</br>Spring, Harvest, faire-day, when no winds do sound,</br>This Meteor worketh mightie effects;</br>And is high prized for many respects,</br>When hearbs and grasse are parched and combust,</br>And Phoebus burning flames colours them like dust,</br>Then comes the Deaw, and doth them recreate:</br>Making them fresh, virent and fortunate,</br>The bowels of the beasts it maketh soluble,</br>And all the grasse more sweete and voluble,</br>A wonder yet here-hence, is collected,</br>Which some Wise shepheards hav'n objected.</br>How Manna a Deaw which is hot and

expert,</br>This is wonderfull to a mortall eye,</br>Yet is no matter in th' Almightie,</br>The Frost to us men most profitable,</br>Though it seemeth nothing comfortable,</br>Is a Meteor watrie

Region scituate</br>In the middst of the Aire:  where being compact,</br>By the colde circle till it be ransact</br>by Phebus heate:  so moystned againe,</br>Is squeezed into a shower of raine,</br>As a Sponge in water deeply sunken,</br>Untill it hath the whole moysture drunken:</br>If with force of hand you squeeze it suddainly,</br>Water from sundrie parts thereof will fly:</br>Raine is an issue from a Clowde watrie;</br>By drops discending from a Region ayrie:</br>(The middle Region of that Element)</br>To moysten this habitable Continent.</br>Where man and beast receyven nourishment,</br>And Flora makes her mantle orient.</br>When a moyst vapour thicke elevated,</br>And by the colde Region macerated,</br>Descendeth downe upon the earth belowe,</br>It is then called a Meteor of snowe.</br>The drops that done fall, resemble a feather,</br>Not as rain's-round-drops contracted together,</br>The feathered-flakes dispersed are bound,</br>To cover the lower circulare

walles:</br>Which comming thither, for food, unawares,</br>Are tangled in lyme, or taken in snares;</br>Shepheards weare Freezes, and Ladies use furres,</br>To keep them from Rewmes, Catarres, and cold Murres;</br>Snow water, Hus-wives at everie turning,</br>Save in a glasse gainst scalding or burning.</br>So farre is the snow from doing of harme,</br>That rootes of trees, corne and grasse, it keepes warme;</br>As with a mantle the earth it enfoldes,</br>Preserving the same from violent coldes.</br>It fattons the Fallow as Shepheards rehearse,</br>Mellowing the ridges, for Coulters to pearse.</br>In the highest mountaine and frozen hill,</br>Snow gendreth Cristall and shyning Berrill.</br>Thus is Snow not the meanest ornament,</br>For us that in the earth are resident;</br>The Haile is reckoned as a mightie cursse,</br>Making all worldly creatures much the worsse.</br>And in Sommer season is ingendred,</br>When grasse and corne is chiefly tendred.</br>The reason why it is hard compacted,</br>Is because it hath his cold contracted.</br>For when it came to the middle region,</br>He found it colder in disposition</br>Then it was wont to be; because the heate</br>Of Phoebus beames, doth now more strongly beate.</br>Which when it cannot beare, it gathereth round,</br>It selfe, least Phoebus should his force confound.</br>And so dissolve it into raine, or sleete,</br>To do some good:  for which Haile is not meete.</br>Therefore round, colde, and hard, it doth discend,</br>Of purpose princely Flora to offend.</br>\"For there can be no perfect convenience,</br>Twixt noble Nature and malevolence.\"</br>Upon her fruits it makes intrusion,</br>Beating in peeces with confusion,</br>The buds of trees, the hearbs, the corne, the flowers,</br>Which Tellus kept for Floras Paramours.</br>There is no watrie Meteor in the Ayre,</br>But is profitable and debonaier,</br>Except this crabbed and furious Haile,</br>That fiercely our nourishment doth assaile,</br>For Sleete is not so forcible or strong,</br>To doe Dame Flora and her Babies wrong.</br>Discending in March, or in Februarie,</br>When Phoebus shews his burning luminarie,</br>But here some may a question propound,</br>Requiring a Philosopher profound,</br>Why is the Ayres middle Region,</br>Coldest in the burning Sommer season?</br>And in the Winter time more temperate,</br>Raine (and not Haile) fitter to generate?</br>Answere.  Two contraries doe alwayes flie,</br>The one from the other naturally,</br>So when it is extreame hottest weather,</br>The cold collecteth his forces together,</br>And keepes himselfe close in his owne defence,</br>Least heate should surprize or expell him thence.</br>Then is he colder then he was before,</br>Having abundance of coldnesse in store.</br>But if that heate be from him devided,</br>His force is dissolved:  Our poynt decided,</br>Now is the discourse of the water ended.", "EARTHLY ELEMENT.</br>And the shepheard to the earth discended:</br>The Centre of the whole

to my memorie,</br>A Stone of admirable utilitie.</br>Drawing by secret divine influence,</br>Iron and Steele surpassing humane sence.</br>Two ends it hath, if they be rightly squar'd,</br>Doone wondrous thinges which cannot be declar'd.</br>Nor can we all the secret vertues tell,</br>Which in this little ragged stone doon dwell.</br>For one among the rest is admirable,</br>The reason whereof is Inscrutable.</br>One end drawes yron to it all the day;</br>The other end doth make it runne away.</br>One end drawes yron to the southern Pole,</br>The other, to the center of the Northern-hole:</br>So strange and implacable enmitie,</br>Such hidden raging Malignitie</br>In working nature of this stone is found,</br>As doth the wit of all the world confound.</br>All Mariners of force must be dismayed,</br>If they should want the Load-stones blessed ayde,</br>By this they saile, else knowe not where they were,</br>Such sov'reigntie in Ship doth Magnes beare.</br>Lapis Herculeus it is called those,</br>That say Herculeus did it first disclose,</br>Smiris a noble stone in operation</br>Much used for the Teeth's purgation.</br>The Pumice stone was not formed in vaine,</br>To clense your parchment and to make it plaine.</br>Tartar found in the bottom of Wine-Leyes,</br>For Pimpled spotted face, is of high Price.</br>A stone there is of colour blacke as sables,</br>Which Marchaunts oft, use for wrighting-tables.</br>This also deserveth some memorie,</br>Because it serveth mans commoditie.</br>The stone which Shepheards doon Aethites call,</br>Is of great vertue, though the stone be small,</br>For this I wish young Ladies understand,</br>If they hold this stone closely in their hand,</br>Or apply it, to the place Parturient</br>They shall be

all therein comprised,</br>One onely thing remain's as yet untouch'd,</br>Which is moste admirable, yet closely couch'd,</br>Tis this:  to what end all these thinges were fram'd!</br>Which in this particular we have nam'd.</br>The answere is the use thereof is great,</br>Eyther for contemplation or Meate.</br>Principallie for blessed mans behoofe,</br>These things were framed as a certaine proofe,</br>That he would love him everlastingly,</br>For whome he framed universalitie.</br>For when worlds engine was thus finished,</br>And all the parts perfectly polished:</br>Yet this whole frame served Pan to no purpose,</br>Nor did he benefite by one of those,</br>Whom he had made, upon, and in this round,</br>Heaven, or Earth, or what therein is found.</br>For next to heaven were the Angels made,</br>And shortly after some fell Retrograde.</br>And became divels by alteration,</br>Of all their qualities in creation.</br>And have their place within the spacious ayre,</br>Kept in Chaines of everlasting Despaire.</br>Yet not of Angell, Divell:  or ought created,</br>And Pan neede in pleasure scituated,</br>Yet would he make this glorious world, and why?</br>For that he ment to frame a Monarchie:</br>Or large Empire full of soveraigntie,</br>Then formed he a Prince of royall dignitie</br>Of a wonderfull Grace and Majestie,</br>To sway this Imperiall Monarchie,</br>He framed first his bodies lineaments,</br>With all his admirable Complements.</br>As a yong man of thirtie yeares of age,</br>Beautifull, gratious, of comely visage.</br>Yet dead he lay, as carkasse on a greene,</br>No life or motion in him felt or seene.</br>Like sweete Adonis sleeping on the Mount,</br>Whom peerlesse Venus had in high account.</br>Then breath'd he into him the breath of life,</br>Where presently began a gentle strife.</br>When every limme began it selfe to move,</br>And stretch it selfe his vitall force to prove,</br>The closed eyes their Curtaines did display,</br>The rowling eye had motion everie way.</br>The nosthrils gan to feele the fragrant smell,</br>Of sweetest sented flowers which there did dwell,</br>The eare began to heare melodious notes</br>Of daintie Birds, from out their warbling throates.</br>The Rubie, liquid, warming vitall blood,</br>Pass'd everie veine, as rivers streaming flood.</br>From Livers fountaine t' impart nourishment,</br>Unto the heart that hath the government,</br>And so through conduits secretly contriv'd,</br>Is blood to every humane part deriv'd.</br>This life to everie part gave perfect

reteyneth memorie.</br>Intelligence hath her place principall,</br>In the crowne of the head highest of all,</br>Fit to receive objects from phantasie,</br>And to commit them unto memorie.</br>Within a branchie filme there lyeth the braine,</br>Close rampir'd up with Barracados twaine:</br>Both maters, and the flint-hardie Scull,</br>Here reignes the Soule, in maner wonderfull.</br>From thence she doth diffuse her operation,</br>To everie member in his scituation.</br>This breathed Soul's an immortall substance,</br>Simple, spirituall and of puissance,</br>Though breathed, yet no part of Pans Essence,</br>But a created glorious existence.</br>Fitting the bodie for Procreation,</br>It selfe not fit for generation.</br>A simple essence cannot be devided,</br>As Philosophers have well decided.</br>Thus being animated his tongue did move,</br>And spake some words which tended unto love.</br>Then never present Pan tooke him by th' hand,</br>And set him on his feete, making him stand.</br>And made him view his glorious Majestie,</br>As farre as might his perspicacitie.</br>And made him view the glorie of the place,</br>With all things fram'd, and set before his face.</br>Producing to him all creatures framed,</br>So to be termed, as he would have them named.</br>He made Eden, Gan, Jehovah habitation,</br>Fit for a Prince of his creation,</br>Replenished with fruites of every kinde,</br>To fit the belly and to please the minde.</br>In the midst of the round world Scituate,</br>The rest with great ease to contemplate.</br>There he inuested him, as in a Throne,</br>Giving him season and possession,</br>And imperiall domination.</br>Of all this lowest roundes creation.</br>Gracing his government with certaine law's,</br>Which Clarkys comprehenden in their Saw's.</br>And being high pointes of Theologie,</br>Surpasse Endymions Philosophie.</br>Marke (Cinthia) where Philosophie doth linne,</br>There alwaies doth Theologie beginne.</br>He cal'd him Adam:  Isch:  an earthly man,</br>Worldes wonder, Monarche, Terrestriall Pan.</br>So glorious shining, Princely excellent,</br>Vertuous, holy, wise, and continent:</br>Sober, modest, strong, grave, and temperate,</br>Amiable, Magnanimous, and moderate.</br>Of comely jesture, and sweetest carriage,</br>Fit to possesse Jove's Queene in marriage.</br>Yet desolate alone, and comfortlesse,</br>Ritch yet poore, pinch'd with solitarines,</br>Commaunding all thinges that were created,</br>Yet could not his minde bee recreated</br>Because he was constrain'd to live alone,</br>Without injoying a companion,</br>Which Pan perceiving, cast him in a sleepe,</br>Commaunding Morpheus, this prince to keepe.</br>As one receiving Opium, or Dwall,</br>Depriv'd of vitall sence, doth deadly fall:</br>So falleth downe this mightie earthly Prince;</br>Never felt Flora such a creature since,</br>Except he were more then a mortall man,</br>Receiving Pearle of Tellus, part of Pan.</br>Falling she tooke him in her blessed armes,</br>And lul'd him fast a sleepe with sacred charmes.</br>Soe dead a sleepe with Incantations,</br>She dressed his bodie with Carnations:</br>Crimsen Gilliflowers, Pinkes and Paunsies,</br>Muske-Roses, and other pleasing Phansies.</br>Thinking herselfe, a Queene moste fortunate,</br>If she might live to chuse him for her mate.</br>But mightie Pan provided otherwise,</br>Out of his sencelesse side he made to rise,</br>A young Princely gratious loving creature,</br>Far surpassing any former feature.</br>Of such a shape divine, and Majestie,</br>As amazeth my best Philosophie.</br>Her face was like my fairest Cinthya.</br>And peradventure like Musophila.</br>Her grace; behaviour; and modestie,</br>Surmounteth any mans Capacitie.</br>Nor by Endimion can be blazed,</br>But it will make the whole world amazed.</br>Heaven and earth cannot the like afford,</br>As must be wife to this imperiall Lord.</br>For she must be of bodie excellent,</br>That must lie by a King Magnificent,</br>And it behooveth her to be precise,</br>To talke with him that's absolutely wise.</br>Pan therefore taking consultation,</br>Said she should serve for generation.</br>Her skinne was white as was the Ivorie,</br>Thinne and smooth as the finest Tiffany,</br>Where through a man might perfectly beholde,</br>The azured veynes, her inward parts to folde.</br>A reddie intermixt vermilion,</br>Diffused was pleasant to looke upon.</br>Her golden hayre dispersed to her thighes,</br>Close shrowd's, Lucina's sacred Misteries.</br>Her modest eyes like sparkling Diamonds,</br>Pure and chaste (unlike to Rosamonds,)</br>Piercing like Cupids fixed fierie Darts,</br>Sterne, fierce, and bloody, Marble:  Martiall-hearts,</br>Loves mountaines, apples of Hisperida,</br>Such were her brests witnesse my Cinthia,</br>From whence by corall conduits flowing are,</br>Streames of the sweetest caelestiall Nectare,</br>Her crimson smyling lipps did make a showe,</br>That mirth and pleasure in her mouth did growe.</br>Her teeth even set by natures curious hand,</br>As rowes of orientall Pearles did stand.</br>These keepe her tongue, and instruments of voice,</br>Of purpose made to cause her Lord rejoyce.</br>Tender her hands, her fingars long and small,</br>Fit to delight her Lord, and sport withall.</br>Thus fram'd she was in just proportion,</br>Which made the world amaz'd to looke upon.</br>But for the Ornaments of her princely minde,</br>For excellency were not farre behinde.</br>The noble soule of Adam first created,</br>If they be view'd and justly estimated.</br>Some shepheards hav'n seely folkes abused,</br>Which donne denie her soule to be infused</br>Into her bodie, as blessed Adams was,</br>But rather that creation came to passe,</br>By propagation out of Adams soule.</br>We finde no warrant for this in our rowle.</br>For simple essence can no way generate,</br>His like:  and yet conserve his former state.</br>Thus was the glorious Queene accomplished,</br>And with caelestiall beautie furnished.</br>Pan blessed her, and call'd her Adamah,</br>A female earth, and after Nekebah.</br>By reason of her great concavitie,</br>To take and holde begotten progeny,</br>This being doon, he viewd the sleeping man,</br>At his commaund Morpheus swiftly ran.</br>In the darkesome Caves of Erebus,</br>With all his mistie charmes Somniferous.</br>And left the sleeping Prince in Floras lappe,</br>Not knowing what was done for his good happe,</br>At last his lustrious eyes, he gan advaunce,</br>Rouzing himselfe, and shaking of his traunce,</br>And standing up upon his princely feete,</br>Pan caused his vertuous Lady him to greete.</br>Whose suddaine view, strook him to such amaze,</br>As marveling a while did naught but gaze,</br>He wondered at her beautifull porportion,</br>Her gratious lookes and constitution.</br>And looking well upon himselfe (quoth he)</br>So well this peerelesse frame, resembleth me,</br>As if she were my propper flesh and bone,</br>In bodie and soule, wee seeme to be but one.</br>In all the earth her match can not be found,</br>In whome humanitie doth so abound.</br>Then ever living, everlasting Pan,</br>Acquaintd him how everie thing began,</br>And said absolute shall be thy pleasure,</br>Take heere to wife this surpassing treasure,</br>The Prince obey'd, the Lady was content,</br>Mightie Pan marryed them incontinent.</br>And blessed them:  saying they should increase,</br>And fill the world till heaven and earth did cease.</br>This pleas'd the Prince, in token of consent,</br>He gave her halfe this worldly regiment.</br>Parting betweene them, earthes circumference,</br>And cald her Iskah for preheminence,</br>Then was the marriage solemnized,</br>And in our sacred rowles eternized.</br>Where blessed Angels sounded harmonie,</br>And chirping Birds chaunted their Melodie,</br>The King and Queene, with joyfull hearts did sing,</br>And hils and dales, rebounding Eccho's bring.</br>Tellus and Flora, kep't it holy-day,</br>Attired in their moste gorgeous array.</br>And all the Orbs and Spheres gave looking on,</br>When Princely Adam tooke his Paragon.</br>How long they liv'd in their felicitie,</br>Is not contain'd in Natures Mysterie.</br>What was their arte, their life, their fall, their end,</br>By sacred layes
