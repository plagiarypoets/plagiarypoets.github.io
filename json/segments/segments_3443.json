["Sweet Poesy!  when I thy spirit feel</br>Hov'ring &mdash; I hail the blest Arcadian's reign;</br>And strait away, the sullen passions steal,</br>And balm dissolves each adamantine chain&mdash;</br>Thy mystic visions still to me reveal,</br>'Fore the mind's eye, bring valley, hill, or plain,</br>Turret nor tow'r, nor sea mark'd cliff conceal,</br>Nor haunt of elves, nor sport of village train.</br>Then, if 'tis mine, with eagle eye t' explore</br>Earth, air, or ocean, let the dull deride</br>Th' unpurchas'd bliss, that rapt with Nature's lore,</br>Would scorn th' exchange of opulence, or pride</br>Tasteless!  Such rais'd the exil'd bard of yore,</br>Whose shade still frowns on Mulla's joyless side.</br>"]
