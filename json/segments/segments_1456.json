["Hail, deadly Autumn, and thy fading leaf,</br>I love thee drear and gloomy as thou art:</br>Not joyful Spring, like thee, can soften grief,</br>Nor gaudy Summer soothe the aching heart,</br>But in thy cheerless solitary bower,</br>Beneath the varied shade, I love to lie,</br>When dusky Evening's melancholy hour,</br>With boding clouds, obscures the louring sky,</br>And tuneless birds and fading flowers appear,</br>In grief to hang their heads, and mourn the parting year.", "'Tis not the gloomy sky, the parting year;</br>'Tis not the Winter's dreary reign I mourn,</br>But absent friends &mdash; and one than life more dear,</br>And joys departed never to return!</br>O gentle Hope, that 'mid Siberia's snows,</br>Canst cheer the wretched exile's lingering year,</br>And where the sun on cursed Oppression glows,</br>Canst check the sigh, and wipe the falling tear,</br>Thy gentle care &mdash; thy succour I implore,</br>O raise thy heavenly voice, and bid me weep no more.", "Thou hear'st my prayer &mdash; I feel thy holy flame&mdash;</br>And future joys in bright succession rise,</br>And mutual love and friendship &mdash; sacred name!</br>And home and all the blessings that I prize.</br>Thou, Memory, lendst thy aid, and to my view</br>Each friend I love, and every scene most dear,</br>In forms more bright than ever painter drew,</br>Fresh from they pencil's magic tint appear.</br>Roll on, ye lingering hours, that lie between,</br>'Till Truth shall realize, and Virtue bless the scene.</br>"]
