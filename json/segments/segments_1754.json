["Many invoke pale Hesper's pensive sway,</br>When rest supine leans o'er the pillowing clouds,</br>And the last tinklings come</br>From the safe folded flock.", "But me, bright harbinger of coming day,</br>Who shone the first on the primaeval morn;</br>Me, thou delightest more&mdash;</br>Chastely luxuriant.", "Let the poor silken sons of slothful pride</br>Press now their downy couch in languid ease,</br>While visions of dismay</br>Flit o'er their troubled brain.", "Be mine to view; awake to nature's charms,</br>Thy paly flame evanish from the sky,</br>As gradual day usurps</br>The welkin's glowing bounds.", "Mine, to snuff up the pure ambrosial breeze,</br>Which bears aloft the rose-bound car of morn,</br>And mark his early flight</br>The rustling skylark wing.", "And thou, Hygeia, shalt my steps attend,</br>Thou, whom distracted, I so lately wooed,</br>As on my restless bed</br>Slow past the tedious night;", "And slowly, by the taper's sickly gleam</br>Drew my dull curtain; and with anxious eye</br>Strove, through the veil of night</br>To mark the tardy morn.", "Thou, Health, shalt bless me in my early walk,</br>As o'er the upland slope I brush the dew,</br>And feel the genial thrill</br>Dance in my lighten'd veins.", "And as I mark the Cotter from his shed</br>Peep out with jocund face &mdash; thou, too, Content,</br>Shalt steal into my breast,</br>Thy mild, thy placid sway.", "Star of the morning!  these, thy joys I'll share,</br>As rove my pilgrim feet the sylvan haunts;</br>While to thy blushing shrine</br>Due orisons shall rise.</br>"]
