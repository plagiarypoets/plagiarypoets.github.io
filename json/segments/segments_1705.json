["While I with fond officious care,</br>For you my chorded shell prepare,</br>And not unmindful frame an humble lay,</br>Where shall this verse my CYNNTHIO find,</br>What scene of art now charms your mind,</br>Say, on what sacred spot of Roman ground you stray?", "Perhaps you cull each valley's bloom,</br>To strew o'er VIRGIL'S laurell'd tomb,</br>Whence oft at midnight echoing voices sound,</br>For at that hour of silence, there</br>The shades of ancient bards repair,</br>To join in choral song his hallow'd urn around:", "Or wander in the cooling shade</br>Of Sabine bow'rs where HORACE stray'd,</br>And oft' repeat in eager thought elate,</br>(As round in classic search you trace</br>With curious eye the pleasing place)</br>\"This fount he lov'd, and there beneath that oak he sate.\"", "How longs my raptur'd breast with you</br>Great RAPHAEL'S magic strokes to view,</br>To whose blest hand each charm the Graces gave!</br>Whence each fair form with beauty glows</br>Like that of VENUS when she rose,</br>Naked in blushing charms from OCEAN'S hoary wave.", "As oft by roving fancy led</br>To smooth CLITUMNUS' banks you tread,</br>What awful thoughts his fabled waters raise!</br>While the low-thoughted swain, whose flock</br>Grazes around, from some steep rock</br>With vulgar disregard his mazy course surveys.", "Now thro' the ruin'd domes my Muse</br>Your steps with eager flight pursues,</br>That their cleft piles on TYBER'S plains present,</br>Among whose hollow-winding cells</br>Forlorn and wild ROME'S GENIUS dwells,</br>His golden sceptre broke, and purple mantle rent.", "Oft to those mossy mould'ring walls,</br>Those caverns dark, and silent halls,</br>Let me repair by midnight's paly fires,</br>There muse on Empire's fallen state,</br>And frail Ambition's hapless fate,</br>While more than mortal thoughts the solemn scene inspires.", "What lust of power from the cold North</br>Could tempt those Vandal-robbers forth,</br>Fair ITALY, thine vine-clad vales to wast?</br>Whose hands profane, with hostile blade,</br>Thy story'd temples dar'd invade,</br>And all thy Parian seats of Attic art defac'd!", "They, weeping ART in fetters bound,</br>And gor'd her breast with many a wound,</br>And veil'd her charms in clouds of thickest night;</br>Sad POESY, much-injur'd maid,</br>They drove to some dim convent's shade,</br>And quench'd in gloomy mist her lamp's resplendent light.", "There long she wept to darkness doom'd,</br>'Till COSMO'S hand her light relum'd,</br>That once again in lofty TASSO shone,</br>Since has sweet SPENSER caught her fire,</br>She breath'd once more in MILTON'S lyre,</br>And warm'd the soul divine of SHAKESPEAR, fancy's son.", "Nor she, mild queen, will cease to smile</br>On her BRITANNIA'S much-lov'd isle,</br>Where these her best, her favourite Three were born,</br>While THERON warbles Grecian strains,</br>Or polish'd DODINGTON remains,</br>The drooping train of arts to cherish and adorn.</br>"]
