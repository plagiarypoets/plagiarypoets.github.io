["There are strange truths in dreams, and last midnight</br>I dreamed I saw three Spirits on the shore</br>Of Ocean, gleaming in the silver light</br>Of its phosphoric billows, &mdash; One, that wore</br>The look of genius, when it longs to soar,</br>Casting impatient glances at the sky;</br>And one, that stooped and listened to the roar,</br>With pale, sweet lips, yet opened in a sigh,</br>As if she were feared its stern inclemency.", "And there was one, that listened not, nor gazed,</br>But stood with down-fixed eye and folded arm,</br>Fevered with thoughts that on his sunk cheek blazed.</br>The younger Spirit came in soft alarm,</br>And soothed the sufferer, and her cheek grew warm</br>As his; &mdash; and as her slender hand she gave,</br>It trembled. &mdash; Did the charmer feel the charm?</br>That dark-eyed beauty, was she passion's slave?</br>Then, ere they rose, this chant flow'd on the wave:&mdash;", "When shall we three meet again?</br>When my pinion's fiery vane,</br>Leaving many in an antique tower,</br>Gilded hall and rosy bower,</br>Fortress proud, and marble shrine,</br>Throned on Alp and Apennine,</br>Hovers o'er this emerald main&mdash;</br>Then shall we three meet again!", "When shall we three meet again?</br>When I break my heartless chain,</br>Leaving mighty mountains, given</br>To prop the purple dome of heaven;</br>Idol temples starred with gems,</br>Shores of pearl, and sacred streams</br>From the crystal caverns roll'd;</br>Where the Indian sleeps on gold:</br>Finding all their glories vain&mdash;</br>Then shall we three meet again!", "When shall we three meet again?</br>When its fire has left this brain,</br>When this heart can think unmoved</br>On all it loved and lost &mdash; yet loved;</br>When its found of tears is dry,</br>When its home is yonder sky;</br>Long before your task is done,</br>There shall rest this weary one;</br>Crowned with pleasure &mdash; yet in pain,</br>Till we three meet again!</br>"]
