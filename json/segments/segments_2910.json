["Thy beauties, sweet Spring, I resign,</br>Thy approach hath no charms for me;</br>In vain does the woodbine entwine,</br>The bow'r rais'd, Matilda, by thee.", "When oft at stern Winter's retreat,</br>We've watch'd the sweet seasons return;</br>There once was, Matilda, thy seat,</br>There now stands, ah me!  thy cold urn.", "I've deck'd it with fresh gather'd flow'rs,</br>Sweet lilies and primroses pale;</br>I sigh for those once happy hours,</br>That fled with the then passing gale.", "At eve, when the last fading ray</br>Of the sun, leads the flocks to their fold,</br>To thy grave I re-measure my way,</br>And whisper my griefs yet untold.", "Poor Robin perch'd high on that tree,</br>Our names on whose bark I've entwin'd,</br>In fond imitation of thee,</br>With a song tries to solace my mind.", "When responsive thy lute to his song,</br>He warbled with pride on the bough;</br>But drooping he mourns the day long,</br>Since Matilda ne'er answers him now.", "At times through the trees by the stream,</br>The zephyrs in wanton career,</br>Seem to whisper my name in a dream,</br>In that voice once so sweet to my ear.", "Methinks that you tenderly chide,</br>And tell me how long I delay,</br>Ah!  I'll soon be laid cold by thy side,</br>We'll wing then together away.</br>"]
