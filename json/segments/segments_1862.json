["I gaze upon thee &mdash; yet I will not weep&mdash;</br>Though to my lips this heart tumultuous swell&mdash;</br>My soul calls Freedom from her silent sleep,</br>Then wildly breathes that last, lone word &mdash; Farewell!</br>Why doth the music of the sweet-toned shell</br>Break into sadness?  now those soft notes flying</br>Light as the musical airs &mdash; now Freedom's knell</br>Upon the desolate winds abruptly sighing&mdash;</br>Like Ocean's whisp'ring gale, which seems most sweet when dying!", "Oh!  lead me to blest Liberty's lone grave!&mdash;</br>There will I stand, and hear the waters lash</br>Her sacred tomb &mdash; the wildly musical wave</br>May scornfully upon the cold stone dash!</br>Yes!  let seas rage, and angry lightnings flash!</br>Land of the Muses, and of liberty!</br>Once it was thine to bid kings bow, worlds crash!</br>Oh!  once 'twas THINE, immortal Greece, to be</br>The conqueror of the world &mdash; the parent of the free!", "And this is desolation! &mdash; this is death!&mdash;</br>This is the gloomy stillness of the soul!&mdash;</br>Within this chaos doth no spirit breath?&mdash;</br>Doth no soft voice upon the loud seas roll,</br>Wild as thy winds, and free from man's controul?&mdash;</br>Heard faintly, but mysterious, and unseen&mdash;</br>A sad tone issuing from destruction's goal,</br>And gently breathing 'neath that blue serene</br>A sigh for what will be &mdash; what IS and what HAS BEEN?", "Then farewell Athens!  Oh, farewell, farewell!</br>Land of the glorious &mdash; nation of the free!</br>Oh!  do my senses labour 'neath a spell,</br>Gazing on THIS &mdash; which breathes of thine, and thee,</br>City of heroes? &mdash; Orphan'd liberty,</br>Invisible, may even now be near,</br>And bending from her kindred  skies, may be</br>Gazing, in silent madness, mutely HERE&mdash;</br>And mingling with a smile the sweetness of a tear!</br>"]
