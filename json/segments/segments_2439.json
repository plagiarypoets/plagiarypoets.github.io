["Vain was resistance.  We were swift conveyed</br>Into a spacious hall most richly dight,</br>In tapestry of freshest hues arrayed,</br>And glittering with an aching blaze of light,</br>Reflected from a thousand mirrors bright.</br>The arras told the stories of all those</br>Who had ascended to the loftiest height</br>Of worldly power &mdash; by Fortune's aid who rose</br>E'en from the basest grade, through circumstance and foes.", "The Scythian shepherd's tale might there be read,</br>The mighty Tamerlane, and thousands more;</br>But chiefly mark'd I one, who on his head</br>The diadems of two fair kingdoms wore;</br>Two sceptres also in one hand he bore,</br>And with the other scatter'd honours round,</br>While Victory long his legions flew before.&mdash;</br>But soon I saw him stretch'd upon the ground,</br>And he who empires gave, was now a captive bound.", "Calm and majestic was he, though undone&mdash;</br>His royal heart could never be subdued;</br>Still to the last his ardent spirit shone,</br>And as the settling sun more nobly show'd,</br>E'en for the clouds that his decline pursued.</br>Few friends remained &mdash; but they preserv'd their faith</br>In worst extremes with generous fortitude;</br>They serv'd their master to his latest breath,</br>Through all his sufferings, bitterer far than death.</br>"]
