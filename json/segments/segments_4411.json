["Oh, it is sweet at twilight hour to view</br>While sinks the Sun beneath the western sky,</br>The bright clouds sailing through a sea of blue,</br>Attired in robes of gorgeous majesty;</br>And, as along the vaulted canopy,</br>With Sol's last ling'ring crimson rays they beam,</br>Like airy sprites in graceful curves they fly,</br>And wild and fanciful as forms that seem</br>To glide around our couch in fitful feverish dream.", "And now a beauteous landscape strikes mine eyes,</br>Where Nature glows in loveliest, richest pride,</br>And lofty towers, and palaces arise,</br>With gardens gay, and flowing streams beside,</br>Methinks, seraphic forms appear to glide,</br>In snow white robes, amid yon bowers remote!</br>Methinks, upon the zephyrs gentle tide,</br>I hear the lute's low breathing softly float,</br>Like the Eolian harp's slow rising swelling note!", "But oh ye fairy visions of delight,</br>E'en while I gaze, spell bound by Fancy's power,</br>How fast ye vanish from my raptur'd sight</br>Like joy's delusive, evanescent hour!</br>And every mimic scene, and glittering bower,</br>Melts quick away like wreath of mountain snow,</br>And brilliant palaces and gilded tower,</br>Fainter and fainter in the sun-beam glow,</br>Till Night her sable mantle over all doth throw.", "Thus do we ever see the fairest forms,</br>Blighted the soonest by Death's ruthless sway;</br>And thus the brightest minds that Genius warms,</br>Before Misfortune's chilling blast decay&mdash;</br>Thus Youth's enchanting prospects fade away;</br>Thus riper Manhood's warmest hopes deceive;</br>Thus years of gloom do sunny hours outweigh,</br>And thus while o'er departed joys we grieve,</br>Life swiftly flits away like cloud on Summer's eve.</br>"]
