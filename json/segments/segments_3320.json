["As Maria was seated beneath a white thorn,</br>Lamenting, was heard by a swain:</br>Why, Corydon!  absent from evening to morn?</br>Why leave me, dear youth!  to complain?</br>My Lambkins, be mute &mdash; I no pleasure can find,</br>Ye birds, cease your notes on the spray,</br>Your songs are all discord! &mdash; their bleatings unkind!</br>Since Corydon's wander'd away,", "To fetch back a kid, that had stray'd from the fold,</br>He told me he'd haste o'er the plain!</br>He kiss'd me at parting &mdash; but, oh!  twas so cold!</br>I fear'd his return back again;</br>There's Silvia, the handsome &mdash; her cot's on the hill,</br>He danc'd with, last wake, on the green;</br>I know that she loves him! &mdash; my heart, now lie still!</br>In the grove they together were seen.", "With a chaplet of roses she braided his hair,</br>Inviting him home to her cot;</br>He swore that he hated &mdash; yet loves her, I fear!</br>And Maria &mdash; poor I! &mdash; am forgot:</br>'Tis true &mdash; ah!  too true &mdash; by his absence so long;</br>My lambkins, adieu! &mdash; we must part!&mdash;</br>For my Corydon's false &mdash; Oh!  here ends my song!</br>And I die with a love-broken heart.", "The youth, quite unable to hear her bemoan,</br>With joy he bounds o'er the thorn,</br>No, no!  my Maria, my heart is thine own,</br>Unsullied as fleeces just shorn!</br>Entranc'd she beheld him!  eyes sparkling so bright,</br>With rapture he flew to her breast;</br>Their pleasures were equal, from morning to night;</br>When weary'd, went happy to rest.</br>"]
