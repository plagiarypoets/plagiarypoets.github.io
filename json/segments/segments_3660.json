["As Hebe was tending her sheep t' other day,</br>Where the warblers whistle and sing,</br>A rural young swain came tripping that way,</br>As brisk and as blithe as a King.</br>The youth was a stranger to trouble and care,</br>Contentment e'er guided his will;</br>Yet ever regarded the smiles of the fair,</br>Tho' always bred up in a mill.", "Love stole in his breast at the sight of the maid;</br>For he could not her charms but adore:</br>\"And if thou art cruel, dear Hebe, he said,</br>I surely shall love you no more.\"</br>Such tenderness melted her into surprize,</br>(For Hebe was never unkind;)</br>And all in a sudden love glow'd in her eyes</br>Which spoke the dictates of her mind.", "They sat themselves down at the foot of a hill,</br>And chatted together so free;&mdash;</br>'Till Ralph, the young swain, made signs to the mill,</br>Whilst clasping the nymph on his knee:</br>And thus in a transport the miller replied,</br>\"Thy charms, dearest girl, are divine;\"</br>Then press'd her sweet lips, and with rapture he cry'd,</br>\"O Hebe!  consent to be mine!\"", "She listen'd attentive to all his request,</br>And freely comply'd to his will;</br>And now, to her solace, she's married and blest,</br>With honest young Ralph of the mill.</br>Peace follows their footsteps wherever they go,</br>In bliss all their hours are spent;</br>But, leaders of fashion, I'd have you to know,</br>Their \"happiness flows from content.\"</br>"]
