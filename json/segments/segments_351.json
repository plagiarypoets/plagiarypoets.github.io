["My charge it is, those breaches to repaire</br>Which nature takes from sorrow, toil and care,</br>Rest to the limbs and quiet, I confer</br>On troubled minds; but nought can adde to her</br>Whom heaven and her transcendent thoughts have plac'd</br>Above those ills which wretched mortals taste.", "Bright as the deathlesse gods, and happy she</br>From all that may infringe delight, is free:</br>Love at her Royall feet his quiver layes,</br>And not his mother with more haste obeyes.</br>Such reall pleasures, such true joyes suspence,</br>What dream can I present to recompence?", "Should I with lightning fill her awfull hands,</br>And make the clouds seem all at her commands;</br>Or place her in Olimpus top, a guest</br>Among th' mortalls who with Nectar feast:</br>That power would seem that entertaining short</br>Of the true splendor of her present Court;</br>Where all the joyes and all the glories are</br>Of three great Kingdomes, sever'd from the care.</br>I that of fumes and humid vapours made,</br>Ascending doe the seat of sense invade.</br>No cloud so serene a mansion finde</br>To over-cast her ever shining minde,</br>Which holds resemblance with those spotlesse skies,</br>Where flowing Nilus want of raine supplies.</br>That christal heaven, where Phoebus never shrouds</br>His golden beams, nor wraps his face in clouds.", "But what so hard which numbers cannot force,</br>So stoops the moon, and rivers change their course.</br>The bold Moeonian made me dare to sleep</br>Joves dreadful temples in the dew of sleep.</br>And since the Muses do invoke my power,</br>I shall no more decline that sacred bower</br>Where Gloriana their great mistresse lyes,</br>But gently taming those victorious eyes,</br>Charme all her senses; till the joyfull Sun</br>Without a rivall halfe his course has run:</br>Who while my hand that fairer light confines</br>May boast himselfe the brightest thing that shines.</br>"]
