["Quite bless'd with contentment and ease,</br>I formerly rov'd upon Clyde,</br>Whose banks seem'd created to please;</br>And Mary no favours denied.</br>There Spring all his beauties unfolds,</br>And Summer flaunts flow'ry along;</br>There Autumn gives treasures of gold;</br>There is piping, and dancing, and song.", "For Mary I built there a bower,</br>And shelter'd it closely with trees;</br>I planted around it each flower,</br>Which I thought my dear fair one  might please.</br>The songsters in woodland and grove,</br>Came flocking to visit the place:</br>There philomel carol'd her love,</br>And stock-doves did closely embrace.", "I rifled each bough of its store,</br>To serve a repast for the maid,</br>Then hy'd me the green meadow o'er,</br>And handed my love to the shade.</br>My fancy she said she admir'd,</br>My cottage was wonderous fine:</br>How happily there she, retir'd,</br>Would live with a shepherd so kind!", "There many a sweet hour have we spent,</br>There many a fond tale have I told;</br>Our treasure was peace and content,</br>More precious than treasures of gold.</br>But, alas!  to my sorrow I feel,</br>That lasting is no earthly thing:</br>Our bliss is but lent us awhile,</br>And just hovers around on the wing.", "When all I thought dear I enjoy'd,</br>A maid of unspeakable charms,</br>Then fate the gay prospect destroy'd,</br>And tore us from each others arms.</br>E'er since I have wander'd forlorn</br>O'er mountains all lonely and waste:</br>Not chear'd by the smiles of the morn,</br>Nor the transports of love do I taste.</br>"]
