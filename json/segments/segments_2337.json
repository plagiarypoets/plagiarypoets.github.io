["Attend, O ye nymphs and ye swains,</br>O listen a while to my lay;</br>Tho' pensive and languid my strains,</br>Time was I, like you, too was gay;</br>But now my heart's bleeding with grief,</br>And pleasure is fled from my sight;</br>There's nothing can give me relief,</br>There's nothing can give me delight.", "Do ye ask whence my troubles proceed,</br>Why thus I continue to weep;</br>And why, scatter'd over the mead,</br>Unheeded I leave my poor sheep?</br>Reflect, and ye cannot but guess,</br>The reason that makes me so dull;</br>I cannot the cause well express,</br>My heart, my poor heart is so full.", "Don't ye know that my Delia is dead,</br>That this was the day that she dy'd;</br>Tho' a twelvemonth is flown o'er my head,</br>Yet still I my sorrows can't hide;</br>Yes, e'en in the bloom of her charms,</br>When crown'd the fair Queen of the May;</br>Stern death from my eager fond arms,</br>Alas!  cruelly tore her away.", "Ah shepherds and nymphs all so fair!</br>You knew my dear Delia I find;</br>For I see in each eye a soft tear,</br>And trust me I take it most kind;</br>Your pity her merit makes known,</br>Wonder not, then, her loss I deplore;</br>That I never can cease to bemoan,</br>For she's gone &mdash; I shall see her no more!", "They tell me 'tis folly to grieve,</br>And bid me the pastimes to join;</br>They may lesser troubles relieve,</br>But cannot alleviate mine.</br>Each meadow, each green myrtle grove,</br>Where oft we together have stray'd;</br>All a mournful remembrance move,</br>Of the matchless, engaging dear maid.", "Yes Delia, no time can efface,</br>Thy image impress'd on my heart,</br>And who knows but a very short space</br>We may meet again never to part?</br>Grant this, O ye pitying powers!</br>For then will my sorrows all cease,</br>And my anxious corroding sad hours,</br>Be chang'd for whole ages of peace.</br>"]
