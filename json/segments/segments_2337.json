["PART I.</br>Pictured in memory's mellowing glass, how sweet</br>Our infant days, our infant joys, to greet;</br>To roam in fancy in each cherish'd scene,</br>The village church-yard, and the village green,</br>The woodland walk remote, the greenwood glade,</br>The mossy seat beneath the hawthorn's shade,</br>The white-wash'd cottage, where the woodbine grew,</br>And all the favourite haunts our childhood knew!</br>How sweet, while all the evil shuns the gaze,</br>To view the unclouded skies of former days!", "Beloved age of innocence and smiles,</br>When each wing'd hour some new delight beguiles.</br>When the gay heart, to life's sweet day-spring true,</br>Still finds some insect pleasure to pursue.</br>Blest Childhood, Hail! &mdash; Thee simply will I sing,</br>And from myself the artless picture bring;</br>These long-lost scenes to me the past restore,</br>Each humble friend, each pleasure, now no more,</br>And ev'ry stump familiar to my sight</br>Recalls some fond idea of delight.", "This shrubby knoll was once my favourite seat;</br>Here did I love at evening to retreat,</br>And muse alone, till in the vault of night,</br>Hesper, aspiring, shew'd his golden light.</br>Here once again, remote from human noise,</br>I sit me down to think of former joys;</br>Pause on each scene, each treasured scene, once more,</br>And once again each infant walk explore,</br>While as each grove and lawn I recognize,</br>My melted soul suffuses in my eyes.", "And oh!  thou Power, whose myriad trains resort</br>To distant scenes, and picture them to thought;</br>Whose mirror held unto the mourner's eye,</br>Flings to his soul a borrow'd gleam of joy;</br>Blest Memory, guide with finger nicely true,</br>Back to my youth my retrospective view;</br>Recal with faithful vigour to my mind</br>Each face familiar, each relation kind;</br>And all the finer traits of them afford,</br>Whose general outline in my heart is stored.", "In yonder cot, along whose mouldering walls</br>In many a fold the mantling woodbine falls,</br>The village matron kept her little school,</br>Gentle of heart, yet knowing well to rule;</br>Staid was the dame, and modest was her mien;</br>Her garb was coarse, yet whole, and nicely clean:</br>Her neatly-border'd cap, as lily fair,</br>Beneath her chin was pinn'd with decent care,</br>And pendent ruffles, of the whitest lawn,</br>Of ancient make, her elbows did adorn.</br>Faint with old age, and dim were grown her eyes,</br>A pair of spectacles their want supplies;</br>These does she guard secure, in leathern case,</br>From thoughtless wights, in some unweeted place.", "Here first I enter'd, tho' with toil and pain,</br>The low vestibule of learning's fane:</br>Enter'd with pain, yet soon I found the way,</br>Tho' sometimes toilsome, many a sweet display.</br>Much did I grieve on that ill-fated morn</br>When I was first to school reluctant borne;</br>Severe I thought the dame, tho' oft she tried</br>To soothe my swelling spirits when I sighed;</br>And oft, when harshly she reprov'd, I wept,</br>To my lone corner broken-hearted crept,</br>And thought of tender home, where anger never kept.", "But soon enur'd to alphabetic toils,</br>Alert I met the dame with jocund smiles;</br>First at the form, my task for ever true,</br>A little favourite rapidly I grew;</br>And oft she strok'd my head with fond delight,</br>Held me a pattern to the dunce's sight;</br>And as she gave my diligence its praise,</br>Talk'd of the honours of my future days.", "Oh, had the venerable matron thought,</br>Of all the ills by talent often brought;</br>Could she have seen me when revolving years</br>Had brought me deeper in the vale of tears,</br>Then had she wept, and wish'd my wayward fate</br>Had been a lowlier, an unletter'd state;</br>Wish'd that, remote from worldly woes and strife,</br>Unknown, unheard, I might have pass'd through life.", "Where in the busy scene, by peace unblest,</br>Shall the poor wanderer find a place of rest?</br>A lonely mariner on the stormy main,</br>Without a hope the calms of peace to gain;</br>Long toss'd by tempests o'er the world's wide shore,</br>When shall his spirit rest, to toil no more?</br>Not till the light foam of the sea shall lave</br>The sandy surface of his unwept grave.</br>Childhood, to thee I turn, from life's alarms,</br>Serenest season of perpetual calms,&mdash;</br>Turn with delight, and bid the passions cease,</br>And joy to think with thee I tasted peace.</br>Sweet reign of innocence, when no crime defiles,</br>But each new object brings attendant smiles;</br>When future evils never haunt the sight,</br>But all is pregnant with unmixt delight;</br>To thee I turn from riot and from noise,</br>Turn to partake of more congenial joys.", "'Neath yonder elm, that stands upon the moor,</br>When the clock spoke the hour of labour o'er,</br>What clamorous throngs, what happy groupes were seen,</br>In various postures scatt'ring o'er the green!</br>Some shoot the marble, others join the chase</br>Of self-made stag, or run the emulous race;</br>While others, seated on the dappled grass,</br>With doleful tales the light-wing'd minutes pass.</br>Well I remember, how with gesture starch'd,</br>A band of soldiers oft with pride we march'd;</br>For banners to a tall ash we did bind</br>Our handkerchiefs, flapping to the whistling wind;</br>And for our warlike arms we sought the mead,</br>And guns and spears we made of brittle reed;</br>Then, in uncouth array, our feats to crown,</br>We stormed some ruin'd pig-stye for a town.", "Pleas'd with our gay disports, the dame was wont</br>To set her wheel before the cottage front,</br>And o'er her spectacles would often peer,</br>To view our gambols, and our boyish geer.</br>Still as she look'd her wheel kept turning round,</br>With its belov'd monotony of sound.</br>When tir'd with play, we'd set us by her side</br>(For out of school she never knew to chide)&mdash;</br>And wonder at her skill &mdash; well known to fame&mdash;</br>For who could match in spinning with the dame?</br>Her sheets, her linen, which she shew'd with pride</br>To strangers, still her thriftness testified;</br>Tho' we poor wights did wonder much, in troth,</br>How 'twas her spinning manufactur'd cloth.", "Oft would we leave, tho' well belov'd, our play,</br>To chat at home the vacant hour away.</br>Many's the time I've scampered down the glade,</br>To ask the promis'd ditty from the maid,</br>Which well she lov'd, as well she knew to sing,</br>While we around her form'd a little ring:</br>She told of innocence fore-doom'd to bleed,</br>Of wicked guardians bent on bloody deed,</br>Or little children murder'd as they slept;</br>While at each pause we wrung our hands and wept.</br>Sad was such tale, and wonder much did we</br>Such hearts of stone there in the world could be.</br>Poor simple wights, ah!  little did we ween</br>The ills that wait on man in life's sad scene!</br>Ah, little thought that we ourselves should know</br>This world's a world of weeping, and of woe!", "Beloved moment!  then 'twas first I caught</br>The first foundation of romantic thought;</br>Then first I shed bold fancy's thrilling tear,</br>Then first that poesy charmed mine infant ear.</br>Soon stor'd with much of legendary lore,</br>The sports of Childhood charm'd my soul no more,</br>Far from the scene of gaiety and noise,</br>Far, far from turbulent and empty joys,</br>I hied me to the thick o'er arching shade,</br>And there, on mossy carpet listless laid,</br>While at my feet the rippling runnel ran,</br>The days of wild romance antique I'd scan;</br>Soar on the wings of fancy thro' the air,</br>To realms of light, and pierce the radiance there.</br>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;", "PART II.</br>There are, who think that Childhood does not share</br>With age the cup, the bitter cup, of care;</br>Alas!  they know not this unhappy truth,</br>That ev'ry age, and rank, is born to ruth.", "From the first dawn of reason in the mind,</br>Man is foredoom'd the thorns of grief to find;</br>At every step has farther cause to know,</br>The draught of pleasure still is dash'd with woe.", "Yet in the youthful breast, for ever caught</br>With some new object for romantic thought,</br>The impression of the moment quickly flies,</br>And with the morrow every sorrow dies.", "How different manhood! &mdash; then does Thought's control</br>Sink every pang still deeper in the soul;</br>Then keen Affliction's sad unceasing smart</br>Becomes a painful resident in the heart;</br>And care, whom not the gayest can out-brave,</br>Pursues its feeble victim to the grave.</br>Then, as each long-known friend is summon'd hence,</br>We feel a void no joy can recompence,</br>And as we weep o'er ev'ry new-made tomb,</br>Wish that ourselves the next may meet our doom.", "Yes, Childhood, thee no rankling woes pursue,</br>No forms of future ill salute thy view,</br>No pangs repentant bid thee

childhood's heart, a thoughtless shrine,</br>Affection's little thread will ever twine;</br>And tho' but frail may seem each tender tie,</br>The soul foregoes them but with many a sigh.</br>Thus, when the long-expected moment came,</br>When forced to leave the gentle-hearted dame,</br>Reluctant throbbings rose within my breast,</br>And a still tear my silent grief express'd.", "When to the public school compell'd to go,</br>What novel scenes did on my senses flow?</br>There in each breast each active power dilates,</br>Which 'broils whole nations, and convulses states;</br>There reigns, by turns alternate, love and hate,</br>Ambition burns, and factious rebels prate;</br>And in a smaller range, a smaller sphere,</br>The dark deformities of man appear.</br>Yet there the gentler virtues

flight,</br>What fond illusions beam upon the sight!</br>She waves her hand, and lo!  what forms appear!</br>What magic sounds salute the wondering ear!</br>Once more o'er distant regions do we tread,</br>And the cold grave yields up its cherish'd dead;</br>While, present sorrows banish'd far away,</br>Unclouded azure gilds the placid day,</br>Or in the future's cloud-encircled

gate,</br>The Royal Mary solitary sate,</br>And view'd the moon-beam trembling on the wave,</br>And heard the hollow surge her prison lave,</br>Towards France's distant coast she bent her sight,</br>For there her soul had wing'd its longing flight;</br>There did she form full many a scheme of joy,</br>Visions of bliss unclouded with alloy,</br>Which bright thro' hope's deceitful optics beamed,</br>And all became the surety which it seem'd;</br>She wept, yet felt, while all within was calm,</br>In ev'ry tear a melancholy charm.", "To yonder hill, whose sides, deform'd and steep,</br>Just yield a scanty sustenance to the sheep,</br>With thee, my friend, I oftentimes have sped,</br>To see the sun rise from his healthy bed;</br>To watch the aspect of the summer morn,</br>Smiling upon the golden fields of corn,</br>And taste, delighted of superior joys,</br>Beheld thro' sympathy's enchanted eyes:</br>With silent admiration oft we view'd</br>The myriad hues o'er heav'n's blue concave strew'd,</br>The fleecy clouds, of ev'ry tint and shade,</br>Round which the silvery sun-beam glancing play'd,</br>And the round orb itself, in azure throne,</br>Just peeping o'er the blue hill's ridgy zone;</br>We mark'd, delighted, how with aspect gay,</br>Reviving Nature hail'd returning day;</br>Mark'd how the flowrets rear'd their drooping heads,</br>And the wild lambkins bounded o'er the meads,</br>While from each tree, in tones of sweet delight,</br>The birds sung paeans to the source of light:</br>Oft have we watch'd the speckled lark arise,</br>Leave his grass bed, and soar to kindred skies,</br>And rise, and rise, 'till the pain'd sight no more</br>Could trace him in his high aerial tour;</br>Tho' on the ear, at intervals, his song</br>Came wafted slow the wavy breeze along;</br>And we have thought how happy were our lot,</br>Bless'd with some sweet, some solitary cot,</br>Where, from the peep of day, till russet Eve,</br>Began in every dell her forms to weave,</br>We might pursue our sports from day to day,</br>And in each other's arms wear life away.", "At sultry noon too, when our toils were done,</br>We to the gloomy glen were wont to run;</br>There on the turf we lay, while at our feet</br>The cooling rivulet rippled softly sweet;</br>And mus'd on holy theme, and antient lore,</br>Of deeds, and days, and heroes now no more;</br>Heard, as his solemn harp Isaiah swept,</br>Sung woe unto the wicked land &mdash; and wept.</br>Or, fancy-led &mdash; saw Jeremiah mourn,</br>In solemn sorrow o'er Judea's urn.</br>Then to another shore perhaps would rove,</br>With Plato talk in his Ilyssian grove;</br>Or, wand'ring where the Thespian palace rose,</br>Weep once again o'er fair Jocasta's woes.", "Sweet then to us was that romantic band,</br>The ancient legends of our native land&mdash;</br>Chivalric Britomart, and Una fair,</br>And courteous Constance, doom'd to dark despair,</br>By turns our thoughts engag'd; and oft we talk'd</br>Of times when monarch superstition stalk'd,</br>And when the blood-fraught galliots of Rome</br>Brought the grand Druid fabric to its doom:</br>While, where the wood-hung Menai's waters flow,</br>The hoary harpers pour'd the strain of woe.", "While thus employ'd, to us how sad the bell</br>Which summoned us to school! &mdash; 'Twas fancy's knell,</br>And, sadly sounding on the sullen ear,</br>It spoke of study pale, and chilling fear.</br>Yet even then, (for oh, what chains can bind,</br>What powers control, the energies of mind?)</br>E'en then we soar'd to many a height sublime,</br>And many a day-dream charm'd the lazy time.", "At evening too, how pleasing was our walk,</br>Endear'd by friendship's unrestrained talk,</br>When to the upland heights we bent our way,</br>To view the last beam of departing day;</br>How calm was all around; no playful breeze</br>Sighed 'mid the wavy foliage of the trees,</br>But all was still, save when, with drowsy song</br>The grey-fly wound his sullen horn along;</br>And save when, heard in soft, yet merry glee,</br>The distant church bells' mellow harmony;</br>The silver mirror of the lucid brook,</br>That 'mid the tufted broom its still course took;</br>The rugged arch, that clasp'd its silent tides,</br>With moss and rank weeds hanging down its sides,</br>The craggy rock, that jutted on the sight,</br>The shrieking bat, that took its heavy flight,</br>All, all was pregnant with divine delight.</br>We lov'd to watch the swallow swimming high,</br>In the bright azure of the vaulted sky;</br>Or gaze upon the clouds, whose colour'd pride</br>Was scattered thinly o'er the welkin wide,</br>And tinged with such variety of shade,</br>To the charm'd soul sublimest thoughts convey'd.</br>In these what forms romantic did we trace,</br>While Fancy led us o'er the realms of space;</br>Now we espied the thunderer in his car,</br>Leading the embattled seraphim to war,</br>Then stately towers descried, sublimely high,</br>In Gothic grandeur frowning on the sky&mdash;</br>Or saw, wide stretching o'er the azure height,</br>A ridge of glaciers in mural white,</br>Hugely terrific. &mdash; But those times are o'er,</br>And the fond scene can charm mine eyes no more;</br>For thou art gone, and I am left below,</br>Alone to struggle thro' this world of woe.", "The scene is o'er &mdash; still seasons onward roll,</br>And each revolve conducts me toward the goal;</br>Yet all is blank, without one soft relief,</br>One endless continuity of

the weary spirit greets</br>The fading scenes of Childhood's far gone sweets,</br>It catches all the infant's wandering tongue,</br>And prattles on in desultory song.</br>That song must close &mdash;
