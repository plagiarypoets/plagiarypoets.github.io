["On the banks of a smooth flowing stream,</br>There sat a young, beautiful swain,</br>Disappointment in love was his theme,</br>And he sent forth this sorrowful strain.</br>\"Oh Mira, delight of my eyes</br>What maiden with thee can compare,</br>Alas!  love-sick Corydon dies,</br>By thy cruelty, hard hearted fair.", "\"What though, I am lowly and poor,</br>Others rich, and in rank rather high,</br>Thou wilt not find one that has more,</br>Of love, and affection than I.</br>Oh Mira, can thousands of gold,</br>Can even the mines of Peru,</br>Can greatness indiff'rent or cold</br>Ever equal the heart that is true.", "\"How happy!  before I had seen,</br>Thy blush, like the roses of morn,</br>Thy air &mdash; that of beauty's sweet queen,</br>Or the dimples thy cheeks that adorn:</br>Thy ringlets, that flow with such grace,</br>Thy bosom a lily so white,</br>Heard thy voice which more music conveys</br>Than Philomel songster of night.", "\"Before that unfortunate day,</br>The hours mov'd swiftly along,</br>With the shepherds so cheerful and gay,</br>I danc'd to the pipe and the song.</br>Now Flora and Zephyr in vain,</br>Attending the spring of the year,</br>Deck with flow'rets, and verdure the plain,</br>They all dismal as winter appear.", "\"In vain where the rivulet flows,</br>At the foot of the sycamore tree,</br>As usual I strive to repose,</br>Alas!  there's no comfort for me.</br>If in woods or in myrtle alcoves,</br>I wander, or thoughtful recline,</br>The birds while they warble their loves,</br>Cause with envy my breast to repine.", "\"Through the grove every breeze seems to sigh,</br>How strongly it dwells on my mind,</br>Ah!  Corydon why don't you die,</br>Thy Mira is false and unkind.</br>Then die hated youth &mdash; life's career,</br>Arrest in a watery grave,</br>O'er thy fate she may shed a sad tear,</br>Though the lover she scorned to save.\"", "He sung, and the flocks on the plain,</br>Felt compassion on hearing his moan;</br>From the bank where he sat, wretched swain!</br>He arose and walk'd leisurely home!</br>He to hang himself afterwards chose,</br>But in vain sent to neighbours around</br>For a halter to end all his woes&mdash;</br>So he lives still &mdash; quite merry and sound.</br>Yet fortune look'd on him with frowns,</br>With Cupid he oft was at strife,</br>'Till and Old Woman worth ninety pounds,</br>So pleas'd him, he made her his wife!</br>"]
