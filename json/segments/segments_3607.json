["What youth, with odours breathing sweet,</br>Enamour'd PYRRHA, of thy charms,</br>In rosy bower, a lov'd retreat,</br>Enfolds thee in his wanton arms?</br>For whom so simply neat, thy golden hair,</br>Dost thou in ringlets bind, and braid with nicest care?", "How oft, he shall deplore,</br>Betray'd by love his easy youth,</br>And tell the Gods, by whom you swore,</br>Of broken vows, and alter'd truth,</br>How oft on love's smooth sea with dread surprise,</br>Hear the loud tempest howl, and view the angry skies!", "Who raptur'd now enjoys thy charms,</br>And fondly trusts they ne'er will fail,</br>Secure of love's approaching harms,</br>Unconscious of the changing gale;</br>While I escap'd from wreck, and safe on shore,</br>Smile at the faithless winds, and distant billows roar.</br>"]
