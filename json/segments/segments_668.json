["Ere long, on polish'd pillars rear'd</br>High o'er the woods, the tow'rs appear'd;</br>A purer air with purple light</br>Here darts upon my ravish'd sight,</br>The warbling rills o'er stones of gold</br>Their chrystal windings softly roll'd,</br>The birds upborne on wavy wing</br>Round the bright dome in chorus sing;</br>Hark, how their notes of gladness swell,</br>Temper'd by plaintive Philomel;</br>Here on the green smooth-shaven ground,</br>Dancing in many a wanton round,</br>Comus and revelry resort,</br>With naked Liberty, and sport;</br>Here Hebe dwells, and healthy Joy;</br>Young Laughter leads a playful boy;</br>Here sits Content, and strokes a dove,</br>And calls herself the child of Love;</br>On couch of lilies idly laid,</br>Meanwhile I spy a beauteous maid,</br>In azure mantle thinly drest,</br>Yet naked was her swelling breast,</br>Her mantle ill conceal'd the rest.</br>Her artless locks hung loose behind,</br>Dancing in the wanton wind;</br>Her eyes, so sleepy and so mild,</br>With love-sick languors sweetly smil'd;</br>She cast a soul-ensnaring look;</br>A well turn'd silver lute she took,</br>Whose dulcet and delicious sound</br>In transport deep my senses drown'd;</br>With me, O happy shepherds!  stay,</br>(Thus she began her luring lay)</br>All dear delights to thee I'll show</br>That on green earth's gay bosom grow;</br>Lull'd in my downy flow'ry lap,</br>Soft ecstacies each sense shall wrap:</br>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</br>I teach becalmed souls to bless</br>The placid pow'r of Idleness;</br>O enter here, and thou shalt find</br>Each joy to feast th' enraptur'd mind.", " [This representation of Idleness is truly poetical, and reminds us of the delineation of the Pleasure in the Judgement of Hercules.  The contrast arising from the inside of the temple is finely opened:]", "I enter'd, and perceiv'd too late</br>Th' alluring Syren's sad deceit;</br>O!  what a doleful, diff'rent scene</br>Rose to my wond'ring eyes within;</br>The walls in glowing colours show</br>A thousand tales of pictur'd woe;</br>There saw I Ariadne stand</br>All on the bleak and barren sand;</br>Who beckons with beseeching hand</br>To Theseus hasting o'er the main,</br>And kneels, and weeps, and shrieks in vain:</br>There Phaedra from dishevell'd hair</br>Her costly jewels strove to tear;</br>While her fond soul with incest burns,</br>From her fond lord her eyes she turns;</br>In frantic passion seems to say,</br>Come, to the high woods let's away,</br>Beneath some spreading beech reclin'd</br>My lov'd Hyppolitus to find.</br>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</br>There Eloise in stony cell,</br>Where Solitude and Sorrow dwell,</br>Sits lonely by a winking light,</br>And wastes in bitter thoughts the night,</br>Thinking each hollow blast she heard</br>The absent voice of Abelard:</br>Next Tancred all astonish'd stood</br>Gazing on pale Chlorinda's blood</br>What time with rash mistaken spear</br>He smote unknown the warlike fair:</br>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</br>There in her spotless bridal bed</br>Lay injur'd Desdemona dead;</br>The rash-believing Moor stood by,</br>Rolling with jealous rage his eye,</br>Whence the fierce fires of fury flash,</br>His grinding teeth together gnash.</br>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</br>But in the inmost temple stand</br>Of frowning fiends a gloomy band;</br>Here trembled Fear, there Discontent</br>With ragged locks and mantle rent;</br>Next sly Suspicion list'ning stood,</br>Her right hand bath'd in brother's blood;</br>With cruel Pride, and deaf Disdain,</br>Who spurns aside the kneeling swain;</br>Dark Melancholy &mdash; moping spright,</br>Detesting human voice and sight,</br>Sitting alond, her lips did bite.", " [The following is likewise a most impressive image of Despair:]", "She loneliest caves, and gloomy groves,</br>And e'en the doleful dungeon loves;</br>Delights, at awful midnight hours,</br>In whistling winds, and beating show'rs:</br>A panting corpse beside her lay,</br>That just was breathing life away;</br>A youth by her beguil'd of life&mdash;</br>His hand still clasp'd the reeking knife.</br>"]
