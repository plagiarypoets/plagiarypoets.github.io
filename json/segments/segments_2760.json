["No more by stormy passion tost,</br>On disappointment's rugged coast,</br>My weary soul returns to rest:</br>Too long th' impatient rover stray'd</br>And gentle peace too long delay'd</br>To smile on my distracted breast.</br>O Solitude, conduct my feet,</br>To that unenvied calm retreat,</br>Where Meditation, nymph serene,</br>Dwells in the woodland wild unseen.", "Thou lover of the lonely vale,</br>Thou meek-ey'd Meditation hail!</br>With thee, mild spirit, let my stay;</br>And listen to thy converse pure;</br>While no intrusive thoughts allure</br>My footstep from thy pensive way.</br>O, may thy native charms impart</br>Rapture to my consenting heart:</br>And guide my inexperienc'd youth,</br>To Wisdom, elder-born of Truth.", "Cloth'd in the raiment of the sky,</br>When Wisdom left her throne on high,</br>To sojourn for a time below:</br>And with exhilarating rays,</br>Detected Error's flowery maze,</br>That leads to the abyss of woe;</br>With thee, in vale or woody glade,</br>The holy stranger often stray'd;</br>And, listening to thy placid lore,</br>Improv'd her beatific store.", "Often as Cynthia's virgin light</br>Illumes the gloomy void of night,</br>What time her silver-axel'd car</br>Rolls smoothly on the floor of heav'n;</br>Or when the sober-suited seven</br>Unmantles her attending star;</br>Remote from noise, and folly's child,</br>Loud Riot; in thy woodland wild,</br>Some chosen sister of the nine</br>Deals thee her melody divine.", "Invok'd by ev'ry solemn strain,</br>That flow'd on Mona's hallow'd plain,</br>Or by the Menai's mystic shore</br>Where, blending from the cavern'd glade,</br>The oak with venerable shade</br>Shelter'd the musing druid hoar;</br>By those alluring notes of woe,</br>That, while the tears of pity flow,</br>The soul with pensive pleasures bless,</br>Admit me to thy calm recess.</br>"]
