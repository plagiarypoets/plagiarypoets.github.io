["Young Caledon loaded with care,</br>By Fortune's proud menace impell'd,</br>O'er mountains dark, hanging and bare,</br>The path of uncertainty held.", "Thus wild as he wander'd along,</br>In a green fruitful vale he espied</br>A nymph that sweet warbl'd her song</br>By a rivulet's flow'r-sprink'd side.", "Enraptur'd, her charms he survey'd,</br>And tuning his lute to her strain,</br>Conceal'd in a neighbouring shade,</br>Thus softly began to complain.", "\"O Fortune!  unvanquish'd till now,</br>Thy frowns and thy scourge I have born,</br>Disdain'd in thy temple to bow,</br>And dar'd to encounter thy scorn.", "\"But why must I madly admire</br>A maid thus so gay and so fair?</br>When Fortune forbids to aspire,</br>Why thus must I love and despair?", "\"To add a fresh weight to my woe</br>Ah!  why did I visit the vale,</br>Where nought save what thou can'st bestow,</br>The victim of Love can avail?", "\"Should the charmer approve my pure flame,</br>And venture my wand'rings to share;</br>Could I see her soft delicate frame</br>Expos'd to the blasts that I bear?", "\"Thro' wilds and thro' waves let me stray,</br>Afar from the darts of her eye,</br>The pangs of my breast to allay,</br>Or with toil and with torture I die.\"</br>"]
