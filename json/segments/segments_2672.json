["Avert, proud Death, thy lifted spear,</br>Nor vaunt thee King of Terrors, here;</br>Shorn of thy first envenom'd sting,</br>Vain are all terrors thou canst bring:</br>Smite, monster, smite; nor spare thy deepest wound;</br>From Jesse's root our sovereign balm is found.", "When o'er the world's wide misery,</br>Coeval darkness sway'd with thee,</br>Creation shrunk beneath thy frown,</br>And horror mark'd thy ebon crown,</br>Those downcast kingdoms, whelm'd in ruins lie,</br>Smote by the beaming day-spring from on high.", "Tho' clad in vesture of affright,</br>Thou prowl'st beneath the pall of night,</br>Thy famish'd form doth quash alarm,</br>Unpoise that daring strengthless arm,</br>Bow thy diminish'd head &mdash; stern tyrant, flee,</br>For thou art swallow'd up in victory.", "Sweet mercy hath her triumph shown,</br>Thy darken'd host of fear o'erthrown:</br>Now to behold thee &mdash; vanquish'd slave,</br>No power's left beyond the grave;&mdash;</br>We greet thee kind! &mdash; O wonderous friendship this!</br>Welcome, good herald! &mdash; to announce our bliss.</br>"]
