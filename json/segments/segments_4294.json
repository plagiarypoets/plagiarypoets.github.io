["An arbour sequester'd I found,</br>Of hawthorn with woodbines attir'd;</br>'Tis hid by green thickets around,</br>'Tis by my dear Phillis admir'd;</br>I led her one day to the place,</br>From all observation apart;</br>And, urg'd with a lover's embrace,</br>I told her the tale of my heart!", "See, Phillis, the gladness of Love,</br>On ev'ry sweet object impress'd;</br>It softly distills from above,</br>To soothe our afflictions to rest;</br>Though saddest misfortunes arise,</br>Assuming each terrible form;</br>Love's willing attention supplies</br>A shield that can baffle the storm.", "Unblest are all those who decline</br>What Love, only Love, can bestow!</br>Nought else can our pleasures refine,</br>Nought else of true comfort we know;</br>'Twill brighten the gloom of our days,</br>'Twill keep our best feelings awake;</br>O!  let us, avoiding delays,</br>Of Love's balmy raptures partake.", "Observe the gay thickets and vales,</br>The skies that are fulgent above;</br>The fragrance we breathe in the gales;</br>All die with the season of Love!</br>For, all that is charming of Spring,</br>The Summer's high fervor will burn;</br>And, bearing the storm on it's wing,</br>Stern Winter will quickly return.", "How sweet are the valleys of May!</br>Delicious the mornings of June!</br>We'll prize them, be jocund and gay,</br>To joy the new carol attune;</br>The birds have a musical strain!</br>How fragrant the beautiful rose!</br>But, seeking, we seek them in vain,</br>When woodlands are cover'd with snows.", "Our moments incessantly waste,</br>Soon vanish unheeded away;</br>Youth flies on the pinions of haste,</br>Nor listens to mortal delay;</br>Then let us, my Phillis, improve</br>Our time that is dwindling apace,</br>And, yielding to Nature and Love,</br>The joy that's allow'd us embrace!</br>"]
