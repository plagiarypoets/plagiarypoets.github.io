["Wide o'er the drowsy World, incumbent Night,</br>Sullen and drear, his sable wing has spread!</br>The waning Moon, with interrupted light,</br>Gleams cold and misty on my fever'd bed!</br>Cold as she is, to her my bursting heart</br>Shall pour its waste of woe, its unavailing smart.", "Thro' the long hours &mdash; ah me!  how long the hours!</br>My restless limbs no balmy languors know;</br>Griev'd tho' I am, yet grief's assuaging showers</br>From burning eye-balls still refuse to flow;</br>Love's jealous fires, kindled by Aza's frown,</br>Not the vast watry world, with all its waves, can drown.", "Slow pass the Stars along the night's dun plain!</br>Still in their destined sphere serene they move;</br>Nor does their mild effulgence shine in vain,</br>Like the fierce blazes of neglected love:</br>But this &mdash; this pang dissolves the galling chain!</br>Aza, a broken Heart defies thy fix'd disdain!</br>"]
