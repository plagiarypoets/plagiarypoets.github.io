["Oh!  superstition!  scourge of human kind,</br>That rules thy vot'ries with unbounded sway;</br>Thy power to chain the senses, and the mind,</br>None can dispute, and few can disobey.</br>What are the charms, that ever round thee play,</br>That oft we find too strong to brook controul,</br>That frights the brave, and saddens all the gay,</br>While fear doth o'er our senses swiftly roll,</br>Enchaining fast the tongue, and gains upon the soul.", "There are a few who can thy power defy;</br>The number is comparatively small</br>To them that would into thy presence fly,</br>Who wish thy aid, and loudly on thee call.</br>If but a wither'd leaf should chance to fall,</br>A victory over reason, thou can'st gain,</br>And hold the wretch within thy powerful thrall;</br>And does thy thraldom pleasure give, or pain</br>They only find the latter 'neath thy chilling reign.", "Does ignorance only at thy altar kneel?</br>And are the sons of folly only thine?</br>No!  those that deeply think, and inly feel,</br>Are bending lowly, at thy crowded shrine;</br>And he that o'er the midnight lamp doth pine,</br>That views, by fancy's aid, the goblin sprite</br>That trips it o'er the lawn, in pale moon-shine,</br>Or sees the merry dance, at dead of night;</br>Then thou dost fill the heart, and steal his senses quite.", "Great cause of war, let Spain thy horrors tell,</br>Let France thy great and mighty pow'r proclaim</br>And England's voice, the chorus loud shall swell,</br>For each may shudder at thy dreadful name:</br>How many lose their lives in torturing flame,</br>How many pine in want, and on the tree,</br>Expos'd to scorn severe, and public shame,</br>Quit this sad life &mdash; and sink with infamy;</br>Ah, who can tell the evils caus'd alone by thee.", "But let thy vot'ries once remove the veil</br>Which hides thy real features from the sight,</br>No more shalt thou the wilder'd heart assail;</br>There's nought beneath that can enforce thy might,</br>Or seize the heart with terror or affright;</br>No more would men thy hated form revere,</br>Or grope within the darkness of the night,</br>Much brighter objects come their minds to cheer,</br>Religion pure &mdash; can silence every childish fear.</br>"]
