["Hail Pleasure!  goddess ever young,</br>To thee I tune my artless song!</br>Thou nymph divine!  whose sacred power</br>Can all our mortal gifts asswage;</br>Thou bright'ner of life's gloomy hour,</br>Patron of youth, and friend of age.", "Not thee I call, thou Syren fair!</br>Whose wanton smile, lascivious air,</br>Inspires the scene where Comus' train</br>In wanton mirth beguiles the hours,</br>Thy raptures end in shame and pain,</br>And pois'nous are thy sweetest flow'rs.", "But  come, bright nymph, with modest eye,</br>And bosom calm as summer's sky!</br>Sister of innocence, whose name</br>The great, the good, with joy revere;</br>Thine is the youthful poet's flame,</br>And thine the lays that steal the ear.", "Oh!  guide me from the lonely cell,</br>Where Care's pale vot'ries joy to dwell;</br>From deep'ning shades of cloister'd piles,</br>Where Melancholy loves to stray:</br>But lead me where bright Beauty smiles,</br>And all is innocent and gay.", "Where'er I dart my raptur'd eyes,</br>Thy lovely scenes fair blooming rise;</br>Soft music breathes her notes around,</br>The tuneful linnets sing their loves;</br>The blackbird makes the woods resound,</br>And pleasure fills the ecchoing groves.", "Survey this charmful scene around,</br>With good enrich'd, with beauty crown'd!</br>'Twas Wisdom plann'd the work divine,</br>He gave the sun's enliv'ning ray,</br>He form'd yon glitt'ring orbs to shine</br>Along th' etherial way.", "All nature owns his fostering power,</br>His goodness shines in every flower:</br>To man he gave a reas'ning mind,</br>And made him of his works supreme;</br>Each good was for his use design'd,</br>Each sweet that flows in pleasure's stream.", "Then let us not display our sails</br>To catch wild Passion's frantic gales:</br>By Virtue's shore the vessels steer,</br>For dang'rous is the ruffled main;</br>Toss'd on its waves what crouds appear,</br>False Pleasure's cheated train.", "But Virtue all thy paths are peace,</br>And length of days thy joys increase;</br>True pleasure's thine, thou sacred name!</br>Without thee all is spleen and care;</br>Pale Vice destroys th' etherial flame,</br>That makes each scene of Beauty fair!</br>"]
