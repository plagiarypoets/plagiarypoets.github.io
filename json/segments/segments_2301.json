["Ye shepherds attend to my tale,</br>And mourn, for Maria is gone,</br>Each zephyr and soft blowing gale,</br>In compassion give ear to my song.", "Here a shepherd, forlorn I mourn,</br>Depress'd with the clouds of dispair</br>In solitude, ev'ry return,</br>Of each day but increases my care.", "Why was it ordain'd I should stray,</br>On the soft mossy banks of the Esk?</br>Where Lambkins do wantonly play,</br>And their dams in the Sun-beams do bask.", "No more will I 'tend these few sheep,</br>My pipe and my crook I'll forsake,</br>In wild dreams she appears when I sleep,</br>But she's gone from my sight when I 'wake.", "If I view the sweet scenes of our youth,</br>When Innocence taught us to love,</br>When a frown or a gentle reproof,</br>As a check to fond passion did prove.", "How pleasant the moments would glide!</br>When Maria as fair as the morn,</br>From morning to night by my side,</br>The banks of the Esk did adorn.", "Sweet garlands of flowers I oft wove,</br>To deck my lov'd shepherdess' hair,</br>The bloom of the rose from the grove,</br>Soon vanish'd when plac'd near my fair.", "She talk'd and my heart did o'erflow,</br>Each word so enchanted my ear,</br>Her cheeks as the crimson did glow,</br>Where artifice ne'er had a share.", "Why lov'd I a maiden so fair,</br>So gentle so true and so kind?</br>How could she do less than endear,</br>When possess'd of each grace of the mind?", "Maria was bright as the day,</br>That peeps from yon clear op'ning sky,</br>She'll ne'er on these banks again stray,</br>To view my flocks as they pass by.", "Ye maidens, your pastimes forbear,</br>With willows adorning each brow,</br>And drop on her grave a soft tear,</br>Who was constant, was kind, and was true,", "Her grave with the Jessamine flower,</br>I'll deck as an emblem of love,</br>While mourning shall fill my lone bower</br>Forlorn, as the plaints of the dove.</br>"]
