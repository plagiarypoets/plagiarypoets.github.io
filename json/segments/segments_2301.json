["There is a friend who loves me still; &mdash; unchanged</br>By all the errors of my devious way,</br>When fickle fancies have my plans deranged</br>Or hurtful follies lured my steps astray,</br>Her tenderness remain'd: &mdash; nor would she grieve</br>The lonely trusting one, that in her shade did live.", "Amid the wayward freaks of childish haste,&mdash;</br>Amid the wanderings of my youthful lot,</br>When toys deluded, or when phantoms chased,</br>Some sooth'd and promised, &mdash; then their care forgot;</br>But one hath loved me still:  the friend who sleeps</br>Where the long herbage sighs and where remembrance weeps.", "When Friendship's alter'd brow withheld its smile,</br>When cold and stern, her cordial welcome fled;</br>Though like a pilgrim, fainting mid his toil,</br>Even in its pangs my struggling heart has said,</br>One friend there is, who loves me still, &mdash; above;&mdash;</br>The grave hath changed her form, but could not chill her love.", "Reprove me not! &mdash; I trust she loves me still,</br>Though cold, and mute, and motionless her dust,</br>For when my heart hath felt affliction's thrill,</br>Or swoln to bursting, mourn'd its broken trust;</br>Soft on the breeze of heaven, a voice would sigh</br>\"Despond not thus, my child, my spirit hovers nigh.\"&mdash;", "And in the silence of the midnight trance,</br>In snowy robe she comes to cheer my sight;</br>So holy, so benignant is her glance,</br>Her brow so placid, &mdash; and her eye so bright,</br>I know she loves me still: &mdash; and oh! that thought</br>Shall strongly nerve my soul to do the things it ought.</br>"]
