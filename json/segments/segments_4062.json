["Who now, amid the City's dust and din</br>Would pass the irksome day, that can get free,</br>By sultry streets half smother'd, and hemm'd in</br>From sight of rural beauty, rural glee?</br>Hark!  Summer cries &mdash; \"Ye captives, fly to me,</br>My cup of pleasure, see!  is running o'er;</br>No longer voluntary pris'ners be,</br>But haste where Health along the breezy shore,</br>Or winding river, lavishes her store,</br>And feast till ye are full.\"  Alas!  in vain</br>She calls upon the fascinated corps</br>That business fetters with his magic chain&mdash;</br>Pale dupes!  at Mammon's shrine they still delay,</br>Regardless of the charms bright Summer's scenes display.</br>"]
