["The drum beats to arms &mdash; I obey&mdash;</br>Hark? &mdash; I hear the loud ear-piercing fife&mdash;</br>Be constant, my Ruby, I pray,</br>I'll ever be faithful my Life;</br>Through battle, and famine, I'll roam,</br>Regardless of danger, and pain,</br>If you my dear damsel at home,</br>Will offer up prayers for thy Swain.", "In the dark shady grove as you stray,</br>Forget not the sweet-singing dove,</br>Who cooes by his partner all day,</br>A constant, dear, emblem of love;</br>Tho' absent, I'll think of my Fair;</br>Remember your Love, when he's gone;</br>I hope, you will prove now sincere,</br>Else &mdash; alas! &mdash; I'm wretched &mdash; undone.", "Whilst safe in the faith of my dear,</br>All hazards I'll joyfully brave,</br>Encourag'd by her I shan't fear,</br>The loud storms, or blustering wave;</br>With swift, pleasing hopes then I'll flee,</br>My fears, and my doubts are no more,</br>My fond heart I treasure with thee,</br>Then don't my short absence deplore.", "Protect the sweet bower I made,</br>Where oft' I convers'd with my lass,</br>And under a jessamine wreath,</br>The minutes did then swiftly pass;</br>Those past scenes of pleasure and bliss,</br>I hope I shall shortly renew,</br>I'll then take a fond parting kiss,</br>Adieu; my dear Ruby, adieu.</br>"]
