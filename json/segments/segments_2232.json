["With dalliance rude young Zephyr woos</br>Coy May.  Full oft with kind excuse</br>The boisterous boy the Fair denies,</br>Or, with a scornful smile, complies.", "Mindful of disaster past,</br>And shrinking at the northern blast,</br>The sleety storm returning still,</br>The morning hoar, and evening chill;</br>Reluctant comes the timid Spring.</br>Scarce a bee, with airy ring,</br>Murmurs the blossom'd boughs around,</br>That cloath the garden's southern bound:</br>Scarce a sickly straggling flower</br>Decks the rough castle's rifted tower:</br>Scarce the hardy primrose peeps</br>From the dark dell's entangled steeps:</br>O'er the field of waving broom</br>Slowly shoots the golden bloom:</br>And, but by fits, the furze-clad dale</br>Tinctures the transitory gale.</br>While from the shrubbery's naked maze,</br>Where the vegetable blaze</br>Of Flora's brightest 'broidery shone,</br>Every checquer'd charm is flown;</br>Save that the lilac hangs to view</br>Its bursting gems in clusters blue.", "Scant along the ridgy land</br>The beans their new-born ranks expand:</br>The fresh-turn'd soil with tender blades</br>Thinly the sprouting barley shades:</br>Fringing the forest's devious edge,</br>Half-rob'd appears the hawthorn hedge;</br>Or to the distant eye displays</br>Weakly green its budding sprays.", "The swallow, for a moment seen,</br>Skims in haste the village green:</br>From the grey moor, on feeble wing,</br>The screaming plovers idly spring:</br>The butterfly, gay-pointed soon,</br>Explores awhile the tepid noon;</br>And fondly trusts its tender dies</br>To fickle suns, and flattering skies.", "Fraught with a transient, frozen shower,</br>If a cloud should haply lower,</br>Sailing o'er the landscape dark,</br>Mute on a sudden is the lark;</br>But when gleams the sun again</br>O'er the pearl-besprinkled plain,</br>And from behind his watery vail</br>Looks through the thin-descending hail;</br>She mounts, and lessening to the sight,</br>Salutes the blythe return of light,</br>And high her tuneful track pursues</br>Mid the dim rainbow's scatter'd hues.", "Where in venerable rows</br>Widely waving oaks inclose</br>The moat of yonder antique hall,</br>Swarm the rooks with clamorous call;</br>And to the toils of nature true,</br>Wreath their capacious nests anew.", "Musing through the lawny park,</br>The lonely poet loves to mark,</br>How various greens in faint degrees</br>Tinge the tall groupes of various trees;</br>While, careless of the changing year,</br>The pine cerulean, never sear,</br>Towers distinguish'd from the rest,</br>And proudly vaunts her winter vest.", "Within some whispering osier-ile,</br>Where GLYM'S low banks neglected smile;</br>And each trim meadow still retains</br>The wintery torrent's oozy stains:</br>Beneath a willow, long forsook,</br>The fisher seeks his custom'd nook,</br>And startles from their sedge-wove wood</br>The bashful wild-duck's early brood.", "O'er the broad downs, a novel race,</br>Frisk the lambs, with faultering pace,</br>And with eager bleatings fill</br>The foss that skirts the beacon'd hill.", "His free-born vigour yet unbroke</br>To lordly man's usurping yoke,</br>The bounding colt forgets to play;</br>Basking beneath the noontide ray,</br>And stretch'd among the daisies pide</br>Of a green dingle's sloping side:</br>While far beneath, where nature spreads</br>Her boundless length of level meads,</br>In loose luxuriance taught to stray</br>A thousand tumbling rills inlay</br>With silver veins the vale, or pass</br>Redundant through the sparkling grass.", "Yet, in these presages rude,</br>Midst her pensive solitude,</br>Fancy, with prophetic glance,</br>Sees the teeming months advance;</br>The field, the forest, green and gay,</br>The dappled slope, the tedded hay;</br>Sees the reddening orchard blow,</br>The harvest wave, the vintage flow:</br>Sees June unfold his glossy robe</br>Of thousand hues o'er all the globe:</br>Sees Ceres grasp her crown of corn,</br>And Plenty load her ample horn.</br>"]
