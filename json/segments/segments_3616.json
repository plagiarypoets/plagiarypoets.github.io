["Had I the key that ope's the golden doors,</br>That hide the Heavenly Muse from earthly gaze,</br>Sweet Poesy, I'd haunt thy choicest bowers,</br>And crown fair Science with immortal bays;</br>And I would bear my PRIESTLY'S name along,</br>In rich harmonic streams of never-ending song.", "But needs the sacred Sun, supremely bright,</br>The less resplendent light of meaner fires?</br>So Genius shines with pure unborrow'd light,</br>So Virtue lives, when ev'n the Muse expires:</br>To distant lands fair Fame shall wait on thee,</br>And Melancholy stay, and think and weep with me.</br>"]
