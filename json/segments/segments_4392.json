["Where are Balclutha's turrets?  Desolate</br>And fall'n.  Silence dwells amid the halls.</br>Fire has been there, with his inveterate</br>Deep-printing tooth.  Diminished Clutha crawls,</br>Pushed from her ancient bed by crumbled walls.</br>There his white beard th' usurping thistle rears;</br>There over whistling moss the chafed wind brawls.</br>And see!  yon casement where the fox appears</br>Sole warden; peeping forth through the rank grass of years.</br>"]
