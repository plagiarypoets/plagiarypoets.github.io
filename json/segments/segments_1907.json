["I will write down thy name, and when 'tis writ,</br>Will turn me from the hum that mortals keep</br>In the wide world without, and gaze on it!</br>It telleth of the past &mdash; calling from sleep</br>Such dear, yet mournful thoughts, as make us smile, and weep.", "Belov'd and best!  what thousand feelings start,</br>As o'er the paper's course my fingers move&mdash;</br>My Brother!  dearest, kindest as thou art!</br>How can these lips my heart's affection prove?</br>I could not speak the words, if words could speak my love.", "Together have we past our infant hours,</br>Together sported Childhood's spring away,</br>Together cull'd young Hope's fast budding flowers,</br>To wreathe the forehead of each coming day!</br>Yes!  for the present's sun makes e'en the future gay.", "And when the laughing mood was nearly o'er,</br>Together, many a minute did we wile</br>On Horace' page, or Maro's sweeter lore;</br>While one young critic, on the classic style,</br>Would sagely try to frown, and make the other smile.", "But now alone thou con'st the ancient tome&mdash;</br>And sometimes thy dear studies, it may be,</br>Are cross'd by dearer dreams of me and home!</br>Alone I muse on Homer &mdash; thoughts are free&mdash;</br>And if mine often stray, they go in search of thee!", "I may not praise the here &mdash; I will not bless!</br>Yet all thy goodness doth my memory bear,</br>Cherish'd by more than Friendship's tenderness&mdash;</br>And, in the silence of my evening prayer,</br>Thou shalt not be forgot &mdash; thy dear name shall be there!</br>"]
