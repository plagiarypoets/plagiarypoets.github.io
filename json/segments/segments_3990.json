["Ill fated youth, adieu!  was thine a breast</br>Where fell Despair might fix her dark resolve,</br>To marr thy simple heart,</br>And snatch thee from the world?", "While Fancy finds a friend, and Genius charms</br>With eagle-eye and high-aspiring thought,</br>Thy sainted memory</br>Shall ever sacred live.", "When Spring, with scanty vest and maiden smile,</br>Leads on the sprightly months and infant year,</br>Her tears of morning dew</br>Shall wet thy death-bed cold.", "When jocund Summer, with her honied breath,</br>(Sweetning the golden grain and blythsome gale)</br>Displays her sun-burnt face</br>Beneath the hat of straw:", "The lily's hanging head, the pansy pale,</br>Poor Fancy's lowly followers, in meek</br>Attire, shall deck thy turf</br>And, withering, lie with thee.", "When sober Autumn, with lack-lustre eye,</br>Shakes, with a bitter blast, the yellow leaf,</br>And hears the woodman's song,</br>And early sportsman's foot;", "When naked Winter, like a pilgrim grey,</br>Of veriest rude aspect, and joyless brow,</br>Calls for the carol wild,</br>And trims the social fire:", "Remembrance oft, in Pity's pensive ear,</br>At silent eve shall sorrowing toll thy knell,</br>And tell to after days</br>Thy tale, thy luckless tale!</br>"]
