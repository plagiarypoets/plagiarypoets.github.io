["One ev'ning reclin'd in the bow'r,</br>Where woodbines and willows entwine,</br>I plaited a wreath of each flow'r,</br>And said the fair garland was thine.</br>The pink, and the lily, and rose,</br>To heighten their tints, how they strove!</br>But they never could emulate those</br>That are painted by beauty and love.", "To deck that fair bosom, how fine,</br>And how sweet would their blossoms appear!</br>I would call all their fragrance divine,</br>But the charms of their owner &mdash; how dear!</br>Or to bloom in her tresses so gay,</br>Other flow'rets would envy them there;</br>In beauty to flaunt it all day,</br>And to grace the soft smiles of the fair.", "But thriftless the garland was wove;</br>The flow'rets they blossom'd in vain;</br>Since absent the maid whom we love,</br>Since Delia has quitted the plain:</br>Yet hope fondly sought to adorn</br>The landscape in raptures it drew,</br>I thought she would quickly return,</br>\"So sweetly she bade us adieu!\"", "But summer, with all her mild train,</br>Is gone, with the smiles of the year;</br>Rich autumn has finish'd his reign,</br>And &mdash; the charmer has fail'd to appear.</br>To the jessamine bow'r I repair,</br>But nature her gifts has denied;</br>The flow'rets I wove for the fair</br>Have shrunk up their foliage, and &mdash; dy'd.", "Now winter discolours the year,</br>The meadows and fields please no more,</br>No flow'rs in our garden appear,</br>In the garden that charm'd us before:</br>But, the Shepherdess!  should she return,</br>And re-visit the snow-cover'd plain,</br>Soft spring would the landscape adorn,</br>And the garland would blossom again.</br>"]
