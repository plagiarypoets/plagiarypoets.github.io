["Three angel graces were there in her traine,</br>The which to Resignation would she lend</br>Her heart in hour of sorrow to sustain,</br>And prove how far, above all earthly friend,</br>Her power to aid the humble doth extend.</br>Twaine of these graces must on earth abide</br>Whilest man remains, the child of sin and woe,</br>Then cease their being:  but the third shall guide</br>Man to heaven's gates, and, entering there, shall know</br>Eternity's full joys, that never cease to grow.", "The first of stature tall and stately mien,</br>With strong impression waked the awe-struck mind;</br>Upon a bleeding cross she lov'd to lean;</br>To pensive musing did she seem inclin'd,</br>And solemn was her voice, yet wond'rous kind;</br>In her right hand a sacred cup she bore,</br>The which she offered to the wounded breast,</br>Albeit suffering with guilt's cruel sore,&mdash;</br>Who drank this sov'reign balm, its power confest,</br>And hail'd the promis'd dawn of everlasting rest.", "And on this dame there did a damsel wait&mdash;</br>Yclad she was in garb of sober brown;</br>Steady, yet cheerful, was her gentle gait,</br>Ne ever did she laugh, ne ever frown;</br>Her face was fair, as is the cygnet's down;</br>Her voice was meek, like to the constant dove;</br>Nor smiles, nor tears, dwelt in her artless eye;</br>Tho' all her deeds were charity and love:</br>Such was this damsel faire, yclep'd Tranquility.", "And Resignation, with this handmaid, sought</br>No higher bliss than in this bower to dwell;</br>Save when one visitant celestial brought</br>Such store of comfort to her modest cell,</br>Scarce heaven itself that blessing could excel:&mdash;</br>From God's own throne this guest derived her birth,</br>And with his glorious beauty was she dight;</br>And thence was sent to bless the gladden'd earth</br>With beams above the sun's meridian bright:</br>Such was this wonderous guest, Religion hight.</br>"]
