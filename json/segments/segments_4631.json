["O!  Phillida, hear the distress</br>My heart can no longer conceal;</br>Ah!  why should I fear to confess</br>What beauty commands me to feel?", "To feel that the joys of the plain,</br>Oh!  never can solace impart,</br>While Phillida frowns in disdain,</br>Or Corydon's tender of heart.", "As odorous blossoms of May,</br>That lure the industrious swarm,</br>Which bloom in the smile of the day,</br>But fade in the frown of the storm,", "So Phillida wrinkles her brow,</br>And my bosom is ready to break;</br>But heavens, oh!  I cannot tell how,</br>When dimples inhabit her cheek.", "When I look on the favourite kid,</br>Whose shoulder with blue-bells you gird,</br>(The wish you can never forbid,)</br>I long to be one of the herd:", "To play on the banks of the brook</br>Where strawberry clusters are ripe,</br>And hear, as you lean on your crook,</br>Soft melody flow from your pipe.", "Disorder encircles me round,</br>The stores of my dairy decay,</br>Untill'd is my desolate ground,</br>My cattle are running astray.", "O!  Phillida, never again</br>The sighs of my bosom will cease,</br>Till you share with your pastoral swain</br>The blessings of conjugal peace.</br>"]
