["Ah!  wherefore silent is thine Edwin's muse?</br>The muse which erst inspir'd his infant thought,</br>Which shew'd him Nature in its various views,</br>And in his breast sublime conceptions wrought;</br>Which his young genius to perfection brought,</br>And rais'd to heaven his heaven-aspiring soul;</br>Gave him to know what he so keenly sought,</br>How stars and planets in their orbits roll,</br>Obedient still to him whose power propels the whole.", "Time's lenient hand hath pour'd his sov'reign balm,</br>And sooth'd the anguish of thine wounded heart;</br>Restor'd thy bosom to its wonted calm,</br>And gently eas'd it of Affliction's dart:</br>Oh!  may it never more a pang impart,</br>To interrupt the progress of the song,</br>Where Nature shines, array'd with justest art,</br>Moving with grace majestical along,</br>In numbers sweetly smooth, with sense sublimely strong.", "Forgive the friend who, in unpolish'd strains,</br>Would fondly rouse thee to resume the lyre,</br>And sing of Edwin, boast of Scottish swains,</br>With all thy wonted energy and fire.</br>From graver studies for a while respire,</br>Thro' cheerful Fancy's flow'ry fields to stray;</br>Clad in the Minstrel's favourite attire,</br>His modest worth,  his dignity, display,</br>Ammending thoughtless man by thy instructive lay.</br>"]
