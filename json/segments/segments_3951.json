["Ye Dryads attentively hear</br>A shepherd deplore his sad fate;</br>Ye kind-hearted swains lend an ear</br>To what I with sorrow relate.", "My Phillis that gladden'd each heart</br>Is gone never more to return,</br>She did like a lambkin depart,</br>And bade her lov'd shepherd not mourn.", "But how shall I ever forbear,</br>To wail my sad plaint through the shade,</br>When Phillis, alas!  is not there,</br>The fairest, and gentlest maid.", "Or how shall I try to sustain</br>Her loss (whom I ever held dear)</br>Since her equal I never can gain,</br>Which renders my woe most severe.", "She was chaste as the zephyr's soft breeze</br>Attended by mild dropping show'rs,</br>And sweet as the hoard of the bees,</br>Whose quintessence they cull from the flow'rs.", "She shone like the luminous beams</br>Of Sol (when in brightest career)</br>Nor did the fair serpentine streams</br>More lucid, more spotless appear.", "She was lov'd by her innocent lambs,</br>(Who artless do sit on the mead)</br>And caress'd by their maternal dams,</br>Who were joy'd when she watch'd them at feed.", "Ah!  Terrors why didst thou employ,</br>Thy shafts in so cruel a deed,</br>How could'st thou, inhuman, destroy</br>A maid of such virtuous meed.", "Thus, whilst I bemoan'd for my dear,</br>('Mid sorrowful wood-nymphs and swains)</br>Methought, a meek voice I did hear</br>Say, \"Shepherd give o'er thy sad strains.", "\"For why dost thou, simple, repine</br>At the justness of heav'n's decrees,</br>Since she's wafted by Cherubs divine</br>To mansions more blissful than these.\"</br>"]
