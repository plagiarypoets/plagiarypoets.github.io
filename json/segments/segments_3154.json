["Fell war avaunt, thou bane of every good;</br>Plunder, and rapine, are thy daily food;</br>Thy jaws voracious have ten thousands slain,</br>Wilt thou curs'd tyrant thirst for blood again?</br>Know this, mild Peace shall rob thee of thy pow'r,</br>And on fair Albion wonted blessings shower.</br>Peace shall bind thy cruel hand,</br>Bid thee quit our weary land,</br>Banish thee destructive foe,</br>Cause of orphans, widows woe:</br>Peace, soft harbinger of joy,</br>Shall thy haughty wiles destroy.", "Welcome sweet Peace, to thee all hail be given,</br>Long wish'd for comfort, messenger from Heav'n;</br>Pleas'd with thy birth, thy nurse Compassion smil'd,</br>And Pity owns thee her beloved child:</br>We all embrace thee now with eager arms,</br>Admire thy beauty, and adore thy charms.</br>Inspir'd by thee the Muses smile,</br>And welcome thee to Britain's isle,</br>In cheerful strains again they sing,</br>\"Happy People, happy King.\"</br>Lovely Peace with us remain,</br>Whilst the race of George shall reign.", "Commerce now shall raise her drooping head,</br>Again be cherish'd in thy downy bed;</br>The thirsty Merchant shall new schemes pursue,</br>With climes remote, lost friendship shall renew,</br>The Husbandman shall whistle o'er his land,</br>Nor dread the blast of war's devouring hand.</br>Now shall flourish arts and trade,</br>Peace and plenty make us glad;</br>We with thankfulness to heav'n,</br>Shall confess the blessing giv'n;</br>In our hearts shall never cease,</br>Gratitude for thee sweet Peace.</br>"]
