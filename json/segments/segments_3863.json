["How sweetly my moments did glide!</br>How gaily my time past away!</br>While Phoebe was still by my side,</br>And her company sweet'ned each day:</br>While she gave all that virtue could ask,</br>As we walk'd the green meadows along:</br>While to please my dear fair was my task,</br>And her beauty and charms were my song.", "All around us our flocks gently gaz'd,</br>Nor inclin'd from their pasture to rove:</br>The virgins and swains on us gaz'd&mdash;</br>All envied our content and our love.</br>But how chang'd does the scene now appear,</br>Since Phoebe is false to her swain,</br>For me gay spring swells not the year;</br>And the morning sheds fragrance in vain.", "All that's lovely in nature or art</br>To my senses quite tasteless are grown;</br>Nor can beauty again fix my heart,</br>Since Phoebe no more is my own.</br>Ye swains who such anguish have try'd;</br>When death shall conclude my despair,</br>On my tomb write:  \"Here's Colin who dy'd</br>For Phoebe the false and the fair.\"</br>"]
