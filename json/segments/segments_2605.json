["Thou!  who thro' the darksome way</br>Of some lone grove, dost love to stray,</br>Where the world's din, at distance heard,</br>Is mock'd by Pallas' watchful bird;</br>And the pale moon, with trembling light,</br>Unfolds the shadows of the night;</br>Oh hail; nor now, inspiring Muse,</br>To breathe thy sober strain, refuse;</br>Such strain as once in Thracian grove,</br>Could trees and rocks and monsters move,</br>When Orpheus lost his blooming bride,</br>Fast bound by dark Cocytus' tide.</br>But he, for love, so sweetly sung</br>O'er Tartarus' black gulf, among</br>The list'ning Ghosts, that they awhile,</br>Forgetful of eternal toil,</br>Stood round; and as he told his woe,</br>Sighs seem'd to breathe, and tears to flow.", "Or let me hear that mournful sound,</br>Which echoed, Leucate's rocks around;</br>When erst the Lesbian damsel sought</br>A cure for love, too dearly bought;</br>And sister Muses, near at hand,</br>Sang dirges o'er that dismal strand.", "Or, it might better fitting be, </br>To rest beneath some spreading tree:</br>And there, from solitary seat,</br>To hear the ceaseless billows beat;</br>View the black sails that softly glide,</br>Along the promontory's side.", "Or, sometime, from a tow'ring steep,</br>To mark how boundless waters sleep;</br>Waiting till Phoebus gently lave</br>His tresses in the golden wave.</br>Meanwhile the Ring-dove, Nature's child,</br>To twilight tunes her wood-notes wild.</br>Whose sound the patient angler knows,</br>As homeward late at eve he goes.</br>And let me hear the distant horn,</br>That wont to rouse the lagging morn,</br>Now in softer accents play,</br>To cheer the close of parting day.", "Oft too sublime on Alpine brow,</br>While distant thunders roll below,</br>Place me on some turret high,</br>Right against the rushing sky;</br>Where sometime, the clouds between,</br>Sheets of liquid fire are seen.</br>And o'er the dark-brow'd parapet,</br>Centinels, together met,</br>Cautious whisper tales of fear,</br>Suiting well the timid ear;</br>Of signs which in the air of late,</br>To some foretell impending fate;</br>Of footsteps heard without a form,</br>Of noises echoing 'midst the storm.", "Then let me think on ages gone,</br>Deeds of arms, and trophies won;</br>Banners streaming in the air,</br>Glitt'ring arms, and legions fair.</br>Think of battles where the Po,</br>With treach'rous murmur, glides below,</br>Like some peaceful stream that knows</br>No rougher sound, than shepherd's woes;</br>When Thyrsis on its bank complains,</br>In deep-drawn sighs, and dying strains.</br>It hath seen strange sights of yore,</br>Along its far resounding shore.</br>Civil blood, by discord shed,</br>Rage ruling wide in honour's stead.</br>Amid the murmurs of the night,</br>I seem to hear the din of fight;</br>And fancy, as the moon-beams glance,</br>The distant gleam of shield and lance.</br>Sudden turn'd to other view,</br>Fresh thoughts I trace, and pleasures new.</br>Here forests dark and wild appear;</br>There rocks their purple summits rear.</br>Forests fit for deeds of blood,</br>Rocks silver'd with the dashing flood.</br>Oft with trembling steps, and slow,</br>The pilgrim marks his way below.</br>Thro' shadowy vale, and gloomy dell,</br>Strange stories antient legends tell,</br>Such as oft at dead of night</br>Are whisper'd round the lamp's pale light,</br>Till ev'ry hearer looks aghast,</br>And dreads the howling of the blast.</br>Beneath each cross of stone on high,</br>The bones of murder'd wanderers lie.</br>Their ghosts are seen to flit around,</br>And hov'ring mark the hated ground.</br>While many a sigh, and many a shriek,</br>Ring thro' caves and mountains bleak.</br>Thus will the fancy love to stray,</br>'Till breaking clouds mark rising day;</br>Then from the sun's too piercing ken,</br>It shrinks, &mdash; but comes with night again.</br>"]
