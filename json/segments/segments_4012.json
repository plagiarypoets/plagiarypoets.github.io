["So soon does memory perish with the dead!</br>'Tis buried with their ashes in the tomb:</br>Why rears the pyramid its lofty head,</br>Like an immortal tower, defying doom,</br>Even amid the desert? &mdash; say for whom?</br>Will the proud Monarch, wrapped in painted cloth,</br>Sleep more securely in that spacious room</br>Than the poor beggar's in his grave?  The moth</br>And worm know no respect, but feed like on both.</br>"]
