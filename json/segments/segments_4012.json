["Can I forget thee!  when the dewy earth</br>Laughs out with joy beneath Aurora's eye,</br>When the glad zephyrs sing to morning's birth,</br>And the huge forests wave, in ecstacy,</br>Their giant branches; when the azure sky</br>Pours floods of living splendour; when the sea</br>Shouts forth his matin hymn of praise on high;</br>When the young flow'ret opens to the bee,&mdash;</br>There will thine image come!  all will be full of thee.", "Or when at eve, in cloudy grandeur dying,</br>The last broad sunbeam sheds its golden light;</br>When pale-eyed spirits, on starry pinions flying,</br>Draw o'er the earth, the deep blue veil of night;</br>When heaven smiles in liquid splendour bright,</br>And the sad moon stands trembling on the hill,</br>In paleness watching for her lover's flight,</br>Then will bright thoughts of thee my bosom fill,&mdash;</br>Thy name will fill the breeze and whisper from the rill!", "Thou art my only hope!  Oh I have seen</br>All the bright visions of my boyhood fade;</br>The budding wreath of life no more is green,</br>And my heart's darkened by the dull cold shade</br>Of error's sunless clouds!  Oh I have made</br>My life one wild of deep and sad distress,</br>Through which no ray of happiness has played,</br>Save loving thee!  that in this wilderness</br>Could dry up all my tears, and cheer, and heal and bless.</br>"]
