["'Tis Night, and darkness boasts her sable reign,</br>Save that the stars with twinkiling aspects shine,</br>Relieve the gloom that hovers o'er the plain,</br>And fill the breast with extasy divine;</br>O may these joyous feelings still be mine,</br>Not fill'd with pride and fell ambition vain,</br>And all in silence, save the distant bell,</br>That rings some soul's departed funeral knell.", "Ah!  from this heart how soon have flown its joys,&mdash;</br>Gone like the bright beams of the noon-tide sun;</br>No gentle pleasure this sad heart employs,</br>Altho' its mad career has scarce begun:</br>In truth I wish its fickle course was done,</br>Disgusted with the world's unmeaning toys,</br>Which strive to lure me from the paths of right,</br>And then desert me to the shades of Night.", "Yes, Night is soothing to a sick'ned mind,</br>Sicken'd by Flattery's delusive pow'r,</br>Fit only for the weaker part of womankind,</br>Who love its gentle influence for an hour,</br>Till by it all their virtue we devour.</br>But Night restores the vigor of my mind,</br>When, from the hated race of man set free,</br>I chaunt my evening's notes like nightingale on tree.</br>"]
