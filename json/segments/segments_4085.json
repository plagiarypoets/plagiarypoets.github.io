["Through the lov'd haunts of thy romantic vale,</br>Dear KIRBY MOOR!  how often have I stray'd;</br>Or listening sad to legendary tale,</br>Or taking blithe through ev'ry op'ning glade</br>Primrose and cowslip; &mdash; or beneath thy shade</br>Reclining careless near some favourite tree,</br>(Whilst nature smiled in verdant robes array'd,)</br>Tuned my young harp to notes of artless glee,</br>And thus pour'd forth thy praise in wildest minstrelsy.", "Hail!  goddess of this lonely Vale,</br>Spirit of light and beauty, hail!</br>Thou late wast dress'd,</br>In a dazzling vest,</br>And icicles gemm'd thy lofty crest.</br>But thy robe of white, &mdash; it melted away,</br>When young Spring shot forth her reviving ray;</br>And the dew-drops fell on her gentle bosom,</br>And the woods 'gan bud, and the wild flow'rs blossom.</br>And now thou art seen</br>In a robe of green,&mdash;</br>In the pride of youth and beauty's sheen.</br>And where is the eye that hath look'd on thee,</br>In the glow of thy youth, or in Winter's chill,</br>That hath not smiled and rejoic'd to see,</br>That in both thou art lovely and graceful still?</br>There peace reposes,</br>On beds of roses,</br>And Flora hath scatter'd her fragrant posies.</br>And when night hath mantled the lonely Vale,</br>And the moon shines forth in her lustre pale,</br>How sweet are the strains of the nightingale!</br>Oh!  never did Cynthia's virgin beam</br>Gild a lovelier landscape or fairer scene.</br>Hail!  goddess of the lonely Vale,</br>Spirit of light and beauty, hail!</br>Come from thy lone sequestered grot,</br>And bless with thy form this favour'd spot,</br>Or at thou reclined on mossy bed,</br>Where the violet hides its blushing head?</br>Or in woodbine shade,</br>Or in hawthorn glade,</br>Tell, oh!  tell me &mdash; where art thou laid?", "SPIRIT.</br>Daring Minstrel!  would'st thou look</br>In nature's hidden mystic book?</br>Mortal eye bath ne'er beheld</br>Immortality unveil'd.</br>Where I am, &mdash; thou can'st not know;</br>What I am, &mdash; I dare not show,&mdash;</br>Listen to the whisp'ring breeze,&mdash;</br>'Tis my breath that fans the trees;</br>Look upon the blooming rose,&mdash;</br>'Tis my blush with which it glows;</br>In the violet's modest hue,</br>You may read my eye of blue;</br>In the lily's snowy grace,</br>My spotless purity you trace;</br>See the oak's majestic height,</br>Emblem of immortal might;</br>The tallest poplar's graceful stem,</br>Is crowned with my diadem:</br>Minstrel, seek no more to know,</br>Since the rest I dare not show;</br>Mortal eye hath ne'er beheld</br>Immortality unveiled.</br>"]
