["What time Aurora gilds the Eastern skies,</br>And wakes to life sweet Nature, now refresh'd</br>By Night's soft care!  O, may I seek thy smiles,</br>And hail the Lord of day?", "The gaudy scene invites me not alone</br>To view creation in her wond'rous dress,</br>Rob'd in luxuriant charms, transcending far</br>The labour'd schemes of art!", "Sweet Music wakes the groves; the stately trees</br>In rustling adoration bow their heads;</br>While Arts inhabitants proclaim the dawn,</br>And joyful homage pay!", "Hung with Aurora's pearls, blest source of life!</br>Parent of great existence!  let me view</br>Thy orient locks of gold, reflected bright</br>In each enamour'd stream.", "While past'ral melody delights the vales,</br>And glads the woodlands with enchanting notes,</br>I woo thy mild embraces, heav'nly Morn!</br>And meet thy whisp'ring gales.", "O, thou!  whose glories charm the wond'ring eye,</br>And wake sensation thro' the mystic world,</br>In contemplation lost, I feel thy pow'r,</br>And draw a veil on DOUBT!", "To thee all NATURE adoration pays,</br>Celestial Morn!  And bend the grateful knee;</br>Till all thy creatures yield to sober Eve,</br>And dream in silent praise!</br>"]
