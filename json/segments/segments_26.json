["Come from the Muses well Minerva,</br>Come and bring a Coronet:</br>To crowne his head, that doth deserve,</br>A greater gift than Colinet.", "Come from Bacchus bowre Silenus,</br>Come and bring some good-ale grout:</br>For to sprinkle Vino-plenus:</br>All his foolish face about.", "Come thou hither sweet Amyntas</br>All on a silver sounding Swanne:</br>Come and teach this fond A-mint-Asse,</br>Leave the game as he began.", "Come thou hither my friend so pretty,</br>All riding on a Hobby-Horse:</br>Either make thy selfe more witty:</br>Or againe renew thy force:", "Come and decke his browes with baies,</br>That deserves immortall praise.</br>"]
