["A little isle rose smiling before me,</br>Glowing with light and loveliness; behind</br>I left the ancient world, around and o'er me</br>Rose a blue heaven, play'd a gentle wind,</br>And all was ripe with majesty and mind!</br>Nor was this beauty ting'd with aught of sadness,</br>Like pleasures of the world I had resign'd;&mdash;</br>Hope was not mockery &mdash; pleasure was not madness,</br>But o'er my bosom stole a soft and soothing gladness!", "I said I left the world, but not alone&mdash;</br>Such joy had been less joyful were it so;</br>But I was not a solitary one&mdash;</br>One who had been my mate in all my woe;</br>One who had taught my lonely heart to know</br>Bliss amid cares that wore its youth away;</br>She wander'd by my side, content to go</br>Where'er my fate had destin'd me to stray;</br>Chaunting a soothing song to while our weary way.", "That way was weary while we trod the earth,</br>Ceasing to be such when the homes of men</br>Faded upon our sight, and our new birth</br>Of joy began; when we no more could ken</br>The bluely-rising smokes of peopled glen,</br>We hail'd with rapture the high moutain's scorn</br>Of all things human; but were happier when</br>We saw arising, as a second morn,</br>The island of our love &mdash; where hope and joy were born!", "The vision of such refuge had been long</br>An inmate of our bosoms, and behold</br>The sage's gentlest dream &mdash; bard's sweetest song&mdash;</br>All that Romance of fairy scenes hath told,</br>Burst on our ravish'd sight!</br>"]
