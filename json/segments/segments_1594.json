["The House of Tracy was of all belov'd:</br>A generous, gentle, valiant, virtuous Race,</br>Admir'd for Courage and for Arts approv'd,</br>They shun'd Dishonour and they spurn'd Disgrace.</br>The Village Mansion was a noble Place,</br>Whose strong Foundations down a Vale were laid;</br>Pride of its Lords and of the Country Grace,</br>Its Towers were o'er the western hill display'd,</br>And on an Eastern Stream broad cast their Evening Shade.", "Twice twenty Steps of Stone, now mossy all,</br>Led wandering Strangers to the central Door</br>Of a vast Room, by name the marble Hall,</br>Whose squares discolour'd form'd the polish'd floor.</br>Broad were the Stairs and black that rose before</br>And led to Chambers fair and Galleries wide;</br>Here Tracys stood, Men fam'd in days of yore;</br>These Pictures rare, by Taste and Wealth, supply'd</br>The Pride of Tracy these, and worthy praise the pride.", "Th' Improver's Hand was seen in all the place;</br>But Mercy still was a Companion found,</br>And spar'd the Statues fair, the Wood to grace,</br>And Waters clear that fell with murmuring sound</br>From the green Terrace on the higher Ground,</br>With Flowers in Knolls on many a sunny Bank,</br>Where the white flocks o'er velvet Pasture bound;</br>Where Gold-fish long possess'd their marble Tank,</br>And steeds with silky Sides the living Water drank.", "It was a lovely and a rich domain,</br>Vex'd by no Debt, no Mortgage, no Decrease;</br>No Tenant came with unredress'd Complaint</br>Of Churlish Steward or of rigorous Lease;</br>In the fair Village dwelt perpetual Peace,</br>Far as a Patron could his power extend,</br>Hail'd at his birth and mourn'd at his discease;</br>Where all, where each, was pleas'd his help to lend</br>To each, where all might seeking find a friend.", "Two furlongs distant from that seat, its Pride,</br>Was the fair Village plac'd upon a Green,</br>By wood surrounded save the Eastern Side,</br>Where the broad, silent, silvery flood was seen.</br>There stood the peasants' cots, a view serene</br>On either side a small and central Lake,</br>That long the scene of rustic Sports had been.</br>Unenvied People!  may ye still partake</br>Life's honest Joys and pure, and late may ye forsake!", "The whiten'd Church and Vicar's low Abode</br>Are near each other and these Dwellings near;</br>But, far from Town and from the public Road,</br>Few Travellers stray, few Strangers travel here;</br>Where yet an Inn, \"The Tracy's Arms,\" appear,</br>The Mill, the Shop, and Trades that Peasants need,</br>But Farmers all; the Soil to all so dear</br>Gives to the Peasant's Cow a space to feed;</br>Such was the Tracys' will, and Heav'n approves the Deed.", "A numerous Race were these, and Sons were lent</br>To England's Honour and were great in Arms;</br>But now the generous Blood seems nearly spent.</br>One Son one only Son had raised Alarms</br>For Generations three!  nor female Charms</br>As heretofore had done their Parents Grace;</br>These Lords had dwelt amid their flocks and farms,</br>A mild benevolent and virtuous Race,</br>Whose Lives accorded well with this their favourite Place. . . .", "Bound and yet free, they hasten'd to the Shore,</br>And found their Tent, and all they wish'd to find;</br>Much was of Bliss without, within was more&mdash;</br>Food for each Sense; amusement for the Mind;</br>Pictures of pleasant, Books of lively, kind;</br>And Notes and Instruments, for Music meet;</br>For one Delight another they resign'd.</br>Were ever pair transfer'd to happier Seat;</br>Was ever Youth so blest, was ever Maid so sweet?", "Yet, but a moment &mdash; and the bliss was lost;</br>Tents, Treasures, Tracy, and Companions gone;</br>In black, vile boat, on dreadfull billow tost</br>On salt-sea Lake, sat Emely alone.</br>On the dark waters melancholy shone</br>The clouded Regent of the wintry Sky;</br>The muddy Shore no feet might rest upon;</br>Beyond, with haggard Looks and threat'ning Eye,</br>Walk'd Man she fear'd to see, yet fear'd, unseen, to die.", "And, while she fear'd to die and, living, fear'd,</br>A peril worse than Death she now espied.</br>On the wild Waves the ruffian men appear'd,</br>And now approach'd, and now were at her Side;</br>Her tears they see not and her Cries deride.</br>Seaz'd in rude Arm, the trembling maid they take;</br>\"Mercy!\"  her Cry; and, as aloud she cried,</br>Some unseen form in pitying accents spake:</br>\"Choose first or last thy bliss!  now wake, fond maid, awake!\"", "She woke and wonder'd; then again she slept</br>And was with Tracy in the meanest Cot,</br>Wherever Poverty and Terror crept.</br>Such now appear'd their lamentable Lot;</br>Dread was on both, as some accursed Plot</br>Had Cecil for Contriver!  and now fled</br>To the detested and deserted Spot.</br>With his sad wife!  and now in constant dread</br>And wanting Hope and Health, and needing Peace and Bread.", "She wept and, weeping, wonder'd at her Tears;</br>For every woe and care was put to flight.</br>Lord of his Land her Cecil now appears,</br>And She the Lady dearest in his Sight.</br>Her Views are pleasant and her prospect bright;</br>And then again the warning Spirit spake:</br>\"Grief follow[s] Joy, succeeds to Woe Delight&mdash;</br>Both thine; which first, fair Dreamer, wilt thou take?</br>Choose either, but take both!  now, Emely awake!\"</br>"]
