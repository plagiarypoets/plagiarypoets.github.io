["Nymph of the mountain-stream, thy foaming urn</br>Wastes its pure waters on the rock below;</br>There no green herbage shall a leaf return,</br>No plant can flourish and no flow'r can blow;</br>Stern Solitude, whose frwon the heart appals,</br>Dwells on the heath-clad hills, around thy waterfalls.", "Yet not in vain thy murm'ring fountain flows,</br>It cheers the wand'rer in the dreary waste;</br>Awakes dull Silence from his deep repose,</br>And charms the eye, the ear, the soul, of taste.</br>For this the grateful muse in fancy twines,</br>Around thy urn, the rose and waving wild woodbines.", "And when far distant from the glowing scene</br>Of castles, winding straths, and tufted woods,</br>From Lomond's fairy banks, and islands green,</br>His cloud-capt moutains, and his silver floods;</br>Mem'ry shall turn in many a waking dream,</br>To meet thee, lonely Nymph!  beside thy mountain-stream.</br>"]
