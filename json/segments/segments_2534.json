["Is it friendship, that thus, on my heart,</br>Impresses both sorrow and joy?</br>How I sigh, with regret, to depart</br>From the scenes that I ne'er can enjoy!</br>For these hills are enliven'd no more</br>With the sound from lost Corydon's tongue,</br>And the vallies were never so poor</br>Of flow'rets, that bloom'd when he sung!", "How languid the woodbines appear,</br>That laugh'd with the breeze as it stray'd</br>And the lily is pearl'd with a tear,</br>As it droops in his favourite shade.</br>Sigh, sigh, ye soft gales, in despair;</br>Ye streams, in sad murmurs complain;</br>For Genius can never repair</br>The loss of your favourite swain!", "O'er the grave of Simplicity's child</br>The kisses of Nature shall stray,</br>To nourish the flow'r that's wild,</br>To add the fresh blossoms of May.</br>And Pity shall oftentimes rove,</br>Unattended by Envy or Care,</br>To loiter in Corydon's grove,</br>And crown what he lov'd with a tear!</br>"]
