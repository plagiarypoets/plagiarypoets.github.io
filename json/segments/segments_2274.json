["Can Man in plenty thankless live,</br>And take, what Heav'n vouchsafes to give?</br>With unconcern can he behold</br>Yon' solar Orb of dazling Gold,</br>And see unmov'd, each dying plant and flow'r</br>Confess the fiat of its vegetative pow'r?", "The lapses of the chequer'd year</br>Can he review, and not revere:</br>And, while with raptur'd eye he views,</br>Things form'd, and varied to his use,</br>Can he in lordly riot waste his days,</br>Nor from his heart ejaculate one note of praise?", "He can &mdash; whilst he unlicens'd roves,</br>Thro' Sin's gay walks, and tempting groves;</br>Whilst yet he quaffs from pleasure's bowl</br>Spontaneous poison to his soul,</br>From Vice to Vice whilst yet he dares to roam,</br>And recollective thought is absent from her home.", "The  Spring returns with blooming face,</br>The panting Summer runs its race,</br>Next Autumn, richest of the year,</br>And Winter lagging in the rear;</br>Yet tho' these Heralds time's swift ebb proclaim,</br>Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, find him still the same.", "Come Gratitude, my Soul refine,</br>And make thy Poet half divine;</br>Teach me to sing in deathless lays,</br>My glorious benefactor's praise;</br>Come smiling Cherub from thy blest abode,</br>Uplift me on thy Plumes, and bear me to my God.</br>"]
