["By the banks of a murmuring brook,</br>Where spring shed its fragrance around,</br>Neglecting his flock and his crook</br>Alexis lay stretch'd on the ground;</br>Quite dumb, with his sorrows opprest,</br>Till woe from his tears had relief,</br>Then wildly he beat on his breast,</br>And thus disburthen'd his grief.", "Ah fate too unkind and severe!</br>Untimely to snatch to the grave,</br>In Daphne, my all that was dear,</br>And all my fond wishes could crave:</br>Ye bow'rs that have witnessed each scene,</br>Where woodbine and jess'mine entwine,</br>To a flame have you conscious e'er been</br>So spotless as Daphne's and mine?", "What tho' o'er this daisy-deck'd mead</br>A thousand fair lambkins do rove,</br>Tho' well thou canst breathe on the reed,</br>What music's a med'cine for love?</br>Alexis, doom'd ever to wail,</br>Oh think of thy treasures no more!</br>For what would ten thousand avail,</br>They cannot thy Daphne restore.", "Ye hills and ye vallies adieu,</br>Adieu to each youth on the plain;</br>Since nought will my pleasure renew,</br>Ah why should I linger in pain?</br>My lambkins, forsaken by me,</br>Let some happier shepherd enjoy;</br>For all with fresh anguish I see</br>That Daphne's joint cares did employ.", "This said, from the margin he sprung,</br>Grown frantic with love and despair;</br>Yet Daphne, tho' dying, he sung,</br>Still faulter'd the name of his fair:</br>The streams as they murmur'd along,</br>The sorrowful ditty relate,</br>And Zephyrs the willows among,</br>Still sighs the sad tale of his fate.</br>"]
