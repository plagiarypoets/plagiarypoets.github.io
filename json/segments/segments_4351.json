["Where rolls the silver Thames in pompous pride,</br>Whose lordly billows lash each sturdy side;</br>Where thro' the gay extended prospect's seen</br>A mead by Flora deck'd in vivid green;</br>While woodbines, hyacinths, and violets yield</br>Their fragrant odours to perfume the field;</br>Where with the nodding bows soft zephyrs play,</br>And the blithe linnet warbles on the spray.", "Amanda here, in all the pomp of woe,</br>Loose o'er her limbs the sable vestures flow;</br>Her charming hair dishevell'd now bedeck,</br>And hang in auburn ringlets o'er her neck:</br>Hither she came, impell'd by black despair;</br>From her bright eyes distill'd the chrystal tear;</br>Those laughter-looking eyes now sadly weep,</br>A stranger to the joys of balmy sleep;</br>No peace, no comfort can her bosom find,</br>Vain the attempt to soothe her troubled mind:</br>She three times sigh'd, and thrice she smote her breast,</br>\"Was it for this,\" she cry'd, with suppliant face,</br>\"I pay'd my daily homage to her grace?</br>Alas!  too easy, unsuspecting maid!</br>Thy ductile kindness is but ill repaid:</br>Has my once pleasing face lost every charm?</br>This face, which once all bosoms did alarm?</br>The sight of which made Caelia full of spite,</br>T' expire with envy on her wedding night:</br>Have I too lost my happy shape and air,</br>Which drew at court the universal stare?</br>Or was I flatter'd when they said my eyes</br>Caus'd those emotions, those repeated sighs?</br>Fool that I was to trust what men will say,</br>'Who praise to ruin, flatter to betray.'", "\"Why to my eyes appear this varied scene?</br>The spacious meadows' necromantic green,</br>The bow'r, the lawn, the wood, the fertile field,</br>To me no beams of heav'nly comfort yield;</br>Rather let barren horrors smite the ground,</br>And desolation reign supreme around,</br>Level'd in ruins to its lowly bed,</br>No more let yonder fabric raise its head,</br>For ever rid from th' admiring sight,</br>Fit habitation for the birds of night!</br>Let, unmolested, in the open day</br>The prowling wolf securely seize its prey;</br>Pale terror on weak superstition fall,</br>With the ill-omen'd screech owl's dismal squall;</br>Blow, blow ye winds, in hollow murmurs roar,</br>And you, ye waters, overflow the shore</br>In innundations, suited to my mind,</br>With sad destruction overwhelm mankind;</br>May deadly venom creep into the blood,</br>And blights and mildews blast the tender bud;</br>Let pestilence put on its sable robe,</br>And solemn peals of thunder shake the globe;</br>With horror let the forked lightning fly,</br>And everlasting night o'erspread the sky;</br>All, all be famine, death, and misery,</br>For I am BLACKBALL'D by the COTERIE!\"</br>"]
