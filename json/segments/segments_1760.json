["Genius!  thou pow'r sublime and bright,</br>Thou radiant spark of heav'nly light,</br>Sent from above our toil to cheer.</br>How in Shakspeare's hallow'd page,</br>Glowing with poetic rage,</br>Thy magic strokes appear!", "Spenser seiz'd the trembling lyre,</br>How he felt thy sacred fire</br>Let his matchless numbers tell.</br>Goblins stern, and Fairies kind&mdash;</br>Airy offspring of the mind&mdash;</br>To them he tun'd his shell.", "Milton too, that bard divine,</br>Bow'd before thy sacred shrine</br>Of cherub'd hosts, and heaven's high throne,</br>Soaring bold on eagle's wing;</br>O, how sweetly did he sing!</br>But ah!  he sung alone.", "Inspir'd by thee, majestic Young</br>Of Death and Fate sublimely sung;</br>And, while he tun'd his solemn lyre</br>By pale Luna's fickle light,</br>How he charmed the ear of Night,</br>And bade our souls aspire!", "Then Collins chaste, and Theban Gray,</br>Gave to thee the ardent lay;</br>Pleas'd, you hear their numbers flow.</br>Mason's verse you now inspire;</br>Charm'd, you tune his matchless lyre,</br>And dwell with him below.</br>"]
