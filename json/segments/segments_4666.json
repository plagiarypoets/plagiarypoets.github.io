["Give me the lyre &mdash; the lyre of memory's tone,</br>That I may make it eloquent of me</br>And of my feelings!  When, the spell hath flown,</br>That bound us earthward whither may we flee,</br>If not to thee, almighty Minstrelsy?</br>Youth &mdash; friendship &mdash; hope &mdash; love's dreams of dawning bliss,</br>Illumining the future &mdash; all shall be</br>As winter sunshine; but a sound like this,</br>Sung to the ear of night from wave-wash'd precipice,", "Is an eternal soother of the heart;&mdash;</br>The heart that hath gone forth amid the world,</br>Undimm'd by sorrow &mdash; undefil'd by art</br>Whose tranquil wave life's breath had scarcely curl'd,</br>When the wild tempest's banner was unfurl'd&mdash;</br>The heart that bled and battled thro' the throng</br>On whom the burning bolts of death were hurl'd,</br>And lifting Virtue's aegis, rush'd along</br>From Passion's storm and reach'd his peaceful hills of song.", "And here I sit, existence' tumult pass'd&mdash;</br>The lone blue world of waters spread before me,</br>Their rippling music on the calm shore cast,</br>And th' heav'ns, all pure and starry, sparkling o'er me:</br>What are my ills if they to you restore me,</br>Hills of the eagle's pride and torrent's roar!</br>Ocean!  that on thy snow-white bosom bore me</br>To thee thy nurseling bard returns once more,</br>To wake his lyre along thy solitary shore.", "But he returns, alas!  not as he left</br>His rocky home of joys!  It recks not how</br>Of its young dreams his soul hath been bereft,</br>And of their false fair light his darken'd brow:</br>He feels that what he was he is not now!</br>Yet is it not rejuvenescent joy,</br>Thus to this haven of calm to steer his prow,</br>And wake to feelings, years could not destroy,</br>The humble lyre he swept when he was but a boy!</br>"]
