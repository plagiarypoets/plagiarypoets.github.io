["The lengthen'd sand, the desart tract of life,</br>Which bears no landmark but a drear old age,</br>No waters but the troubled stream of strife</br>To cheer us on our weary pilgrimage,</br>And passion's fev'rish calenture assuage;</br>Ay!  who can look on this, and bless the day</br>Which bade him in these scenes of woe engage!</br>No, rather let him early steal away,</br>And stop his course ere yet he falls, misfortune's prey!", "And yet there are some thinly scatter'd flowers,</br>Which bud and blossom in this tainted air;</br>Nurs'd by the milder gales and softer showers,</br>The Violet rears her maiden honours there,</br>Far from the haunts to which rude steps repair.</br>Sweet flower!  I love thy modest secrecy,</br>And ever in my garland thee will bear;</br>Still unregarded by the idler lie,</br>But still thy charms reveal to one adoring eye!", "Oh!  let me find thy rich and purfled flower</br>There where thou liest, in some sequester'd vale;</br>And I will shield thee from the wintry hour,</br>And bear thee to my garden's quiet pale,</br>And hide thy buds where no rude storms assail;</br>Then round the moss-grown stone I'll bid thee twine,</br>Teach thee, at nightfall clos'd, the sun to hail,</br>And watch thy silent  growth with careful eyne:</br>Oh!  come to me, sweet flower, and let me call thee mine!</br>"]
