["Within the windings of yon woody dale,</br>Beside a burnie, on a bonny green,</br>Where raws of whitening hawthorns scent the gale,</br>A wee bit canty theicket house is seen;</br>Fu' snug it stands frae angry winds, I ween,</br>Around, the stacks in riling cones appear,</br>Which shaw the owner thrifty is and bien,</br>Nae pride has he, nor heaps of worthless geer,</br>But routh o' kintra fare, the winter days to cheer.", "Here stands the barn, to hoord the ripen'd gain,</br>With lowly roof, of strae and divets made,</br>Where aft the farmer wheels, with might and main,</br>The whirling flail, and nae ignoble trade:</br>And there the milk-house, where the dairy-maid</br>Aft skims the boyns, and presses out the whey;</br>And here a place, where carts and pleughs are laid;</br>And there the stable, for the horse and kye;</br>And here the hen-house stands, and there the stinking stye.", "Into the ha' house if ye chance to keek,</br>Ye'll tent the ingle blinkin bonnily,</br>The crazy rafters, painted o'er wi' reek;</br>A twa-arm'd chair within the neuk ye'll see,</br>Where aft the guidman leans, wi' meikle glee,</br>And smoaks his pipe, and tells his pawky tale;</br>An antic ambry, made of aiken tree,</br>Wi' caps and luggies, rang'd upon a dale,</br>And meikle toop-horn spoons, and plates to haud the kail.", "Ben i' the spence, for parlour hae they nane,</br>The wa's are brawly whiten'd o'er wi' lime;</br>A polish'd chimla, and a clean hearth stane;</br>A looking-glass, a clock to met the time;</br>A curtain'd bed, and eke a cupboard prime:</br>The house contains nae mae fligairy things,</br>(For luxury is sure an unco crime)</br>Yet, frae this little wealth, contentment springs,</br>And thro' the roof, the voice of discord never rings.</br>"]
