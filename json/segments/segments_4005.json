["In the dry desart of a leathern pocket</br>There yet remains a solitary shilling,</br>In his last retreat. &mdash; So lies the hunted stag,</br>In timorous, fearful mood, when in full cry</br>The bellowing hounds threaten his dissolution.</br>My honest, faithful, generous friend, come forth!</br>Joy of my heart, and pleasure of my eyes,</br>Thou royal stamp of Majesty divine,</br>Must thou dissolve?  Yes, time will have it so.</br>Here, waiter!  bring me change; be not dismay'd:</br>Thy being must have end, but not to-day;</br>The dogs will tear thee, and thy mangled limbs</br>Will soon be scatter'd o'er the joyless waste;</br>Yet, Phoenix like, thou shalt again revive,</br>Again shine forth, assume thy native splendor.</br>But let me charge thee (as my last request)</br>Mix not with vulgar coin; for ever shun</br>The impious hand that would, in iron chest,</br>Thy useful, humble services retard.</br>Now I dismiss thee; &mdash; oh, farewel for ever!</br>As lightning swift fly to some empty fob,</br>And, faithful still as thou hast been to me,</br>Assist where griping penury usurps;</br>For only there thy value can be known.</br>"]
