["Bird of the Paphian Queen, I love to view</br>Thy stately steps my morning seat beside,</br>Thy neck that varies oft its rainbow hue,</br>Rich to the sun, thy breast distended pride,</br>To watch the rolling of thine amber eye,</br>To hear thee flap thy wings, and see thee cut the sky.", "And when at eve I wander forth to woo</br>The melancholy joys of lonely love,</br>How pleasant is it then to hear thy coo,</br>O gentle bird!  soft sounding thro' the grove!</br>VENUS in such a mood thy moaning heard,</br>And chose thee from the tribes of air her fav'rite bird.", "But most, O Pigeon!  most I should delight,</br>When in the west has died the latest ray,</br>And, rising stately in the cloudless night,</br>The moon majestic rolls along her way,</br>O Pigeon, most I should delight to spy</br>Thy curling feet appear to crest a smoking pie!</br>"]
