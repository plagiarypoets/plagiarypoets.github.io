["A paultry, creeping ivy had,</br>By length of time, an oak o'erspread;</br>Twisting, and tangling every arm,</br>Still boasting, that it did no harm:</br>Since, by his aid and strength alone,</br>The oak's secur'd from falling down.", "Now, list'ning to this creature vain,</br>One thus replies, in pure disdain:", "Thou, little, sneaking, scrubby weed!</br>Thou, nothing but thyself dost heed:</br>If suffer'd, thou, this noble trunk</br>Wilt quite suck dry, like any punk.</br>Then soon, his helping hand he gave,</br>And stript it off, the tree to save.", "MORAL.</br>Thus saves the prince, who stands surrounded</br>With cheats, and pilferers confounded;</br>Till he, at once resumes his power,</br>And turns the villains o'er and o'er.</br>"]
