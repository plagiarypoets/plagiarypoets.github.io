["What fury has provok't thy wit to dare</br>With Diomed, to wound the queen of love</br>Thy mistris envy, or thine owne despair?</br>Not the just Pallus in thy breast did move,</br>So blind a rage with such a different fate,</br>He honour won, where thou hast purchast hate.", "She gave assistance to his Trojan foe;</br>Thou that without a rivall thou maiest love,</br>Dost to the beauty of thy Lady owe,</br>While after her the gazing world does move.</br>Canst thou not be content to love alone,</br>Or is thy mistris not content with one?", "Hast thou not read of Arthur's shield,</br>Which but disclos'd, amaz'd the weaker eyes</br>Of proudest foe, and won the doubtfull field?</br>So shall thy Rebell wit become her prize.</br>Should thy Iambecks swell into a book,</br>All were confuted with one Radiant look.", "Heaven he oblig'd that place here in the skies,</br>Rewarding Phoebus, for inspiring so</br>His noble braine by likening to those eyes</br>His joyfull beams, but Phoebus is thy foe:</br>And neither ayds thy fancy nor thy sight,</br>So ill thou rim'st against so faire a light.</br>"]
