["Ah!  Strephon, once blithest of swains,</br>How plaintive thy elegant song!</br>Indeed no more glad are the plains,</br>The plains to which Pleasures belong!</br>My absence can never deprive</br>Each swain of that spirit and mirth,</br>Which spoke our assemblies alive&mdash;</br>Not such is our friend's social worth.", "'Tis true, I delighted to rove,</br>Along the green meadows and fields,</br>When we told of the transports of love,</br>And the raptures which jollity yields;</br>Yet ne'er cou'd my presence alone</br>Be the source of such rapturous joys;</br>Then cease, my dear friend, to bemoan,</br>The youth who your care thus employs.", "Wou'd Fortune but lead me to you,</br>And all my kind wishes approve;</br>Oh!  then we'd those moments renew,</br>Those moments of friendship and love:</br>For neither can absence nor noise,</br>Your image erase from my mind,</br>So lasting and pure are the joys</br>Which in Strephon's dear presence I find!</br>"]
