["In a valley green and wide,</br>Near a rugged mountain's side;</br>Far from riot, noise, and folly,</br>Lives the nymph of Melancholy.</br>When Eve, with all her sable train,</br>Assumes her empire o'er the plain,</br>'Tis then she leaves her moss-grown cell,</br>With the gloomy night to dwell.</br>In her dusk-brown mantle clad,</br>See her walk sedate and sad,</br>With folded arms, and tearful eyes,</br>And breast upheav'd with frequent sighs;</br>O'er verdant lawns with dew bespread,</br>O'er dreary mansions of the dead;</br>Or by the morn's faint glimm'ring beams,</br>Reflecting clear on silv'ry streams.</br>Thro' forests drear, or woods forlorn,</br>Till the peep of roseate morn;</br>Then thro' walks of blushing holly,</br>Glides the nymph of Melancholy.</br>"]
