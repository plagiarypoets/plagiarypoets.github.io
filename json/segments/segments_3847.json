["PHEBE.</br>Why, Colin, thy pipe laid aside,</br>Dost thou musingly look on the ground?</br>The cause from thy Phebe to hide,</br>Would give her poor heart a deep wound.</br>Let thy griefs and thy cares still be mine,</br>Nor deny me that friendship I prize;</br>Why, Colin, why should we repine?</br>Let years teach us both to be wise.", "COLIN.</br>Phebe!  I thought on the days</br>Which thou and thy shepherd have seen,</br>When he was all ear to thy praise,</br>And thou wast the queen of the green.</br>When innocent, thoughtless and gay,</br>We counted our friends by the score,</br>When the present was joyous as May,</br>And the future still promis'd us more.", "PHEBE.</br>Ah!  Colin, by thinking of these,</br>Thou only wilt add to thy pain;</br>In the trying reverse of our days,</br>We live not our summers again.</br>Tho' our flocks, when with Strephon's compar'd,</br>Are few, and our living but plain,</br>We have not by wealth been ensnar'd,</br>For thou hast a name without stain.", "COLIN.</br>Yet Phebe, our friends stand aside</br>('Tis surely a crime to be poor);</br>Thou knowest, since Rosalind dy'd,</br>Scarce one of them enter'd our door.</br>But with thee, my sweet Phebe, and peace,</br>I am not, I cannot be poor;</br>Hence, therefore, repining shall cease,</br>And misers shall sleep less secure.", "PHEBE.</br>May all the blest pow'rs say Amen!</br>May they shield thee from dangers and strife;</br>In riches full oft there is pain,</br>But content is the sweetner of life.</br>Of my wishes, this still was the sum,</br>\"May my shepherd think kindly of me,\"</br>Then welcome the worst that can come,</br>I have all, my dear Colin, in thee.</br>"]
