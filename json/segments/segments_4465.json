["Beautiful infant with thy brow so bright,</br>And eyes of dewy softness, that dost seem</br>By the faint blush of day's decaying light,</br>Like the faint vision of some poet's dream&mdash;</br>Beautiful infant!  thou art welcome here,</br>Although my kiss of love is blended with a tear!", "A tear of tenderness &mdash; perhaps of wo,</br>Will mingle with a mother's smile of joy;</br>And as mine eyes with such soft drops o'erflow,</br>While gazing on thy beauty, my fair boy!</br>Sadness and pleasure there by turns I find,</br>As hope alternate beams, or fear comes o'er my mind.", "Sadness &mdash; to think how soon life's brightest ray</br>By some unfavoring cloud may be o'ercast;</br>How quickly youth's fair dawn will fade away,</br>And manhood's ripen'd noon be o'er and past;</br>And years steal on with eager, hurried pace,</br>Till the cold frost of age sinks all in his embrace.", "Pleasure &mdash; when Fancy whispers thou may'st run</br>The brilliant race of glory or renown;</br>That ere thy life's bright circuit shall be done,</br>Genius may wreathe for thee her laurel crown.</br>Thus hope will promise in my dreaming ear,</br>And then the smile of joy outshines the timid tear.", "But when I think of broken hearts, and blighted</br>By the world's scorn, or Fortune's changing wave,</br>Of talents misapplied, and genius slighted,</br>Or youthful hopes that find an early grave,</br>Then pleasure dies within my sinking heart,</br>And over days to come the tear of grief will start.", "Yet, lovely infant; with thy brow so bright,</br>And eyes of dewy softness, that dost seem</br>By the faint blush of day's decaying light,</br>Like the fair vision of some poet's dream;</br>Yet, lovely infant!  thou art welcome here,</br>Although my kiss of love is mingled with a tear.</br>"]
