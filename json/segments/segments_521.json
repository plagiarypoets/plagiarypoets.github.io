["The barks how fam'd, by lab'ring oars</br>Innumberable driv'n to Phyrgian shores!</br>The blue-ey'd NEREID'S danc'd in jocund rounds,</br>The dolphin, by harmonious sounds,</br>Captiv'd, in gambols flounc'd along the main,</br>All as ACHILLES sail'd to Troy's ill-destin'd plain.", "The Nymphs, Euboea's strand forsook,</br>Their route thro' Pelion's sacred mountain took;</br>A massy shield, with curious sculpture wrought,</br>From VULCAN'S golden forge they brought,</br>Seeking, where PELEUS rear'd thee, swift of pace,</br>Thee, THETIS' sea-born son, ACHILLES, pride of Greece.", "The shield (so whilom did relate</br>A wight return'd from Ilion's hapless fate)</br>Was with a various-figur'd group bespred:</br>There PERSEUS shook the Gorgan head,</br>Soaring with winged feet, as o'er the sea</br>With MAIA'S peerless son, JOVE'S herald, he did flee.", "Full in the midst with dazzling blaze</br>The sun's bright orb shot forth his golden rays,</br>And all around the starry host appear,</br>Glist'ring, as in the heav'nly sphere:</br>Such ardent light fierce HECTOR could affray,</br>HECTOR, estrang'd to fear, appall with dire dismay.", "High on the helmet were display'd</br>Rich images emboss'd, with gold inlaid;</br>There with destructive grasp her trembling prey</br>A SPHINX exulting bore away;</br>There fell CHIMAERA with impetuous force,</br>And breathing fire, rush'd on the Pirenaean horse.", "Sublime in his triumphant car,</br>ACHILLES press'd amid the thickest war;</br>The generous steeds flew prancing o'er the plain,</br>And champing foam'd with proud disdain;</br>Whilst, as he brandish'd high his deadly spear,</br>Thick clouds of dust arose, and darken'd all the rear.", "Such chieftains on th' embattled plain</br>Own'd great ATRIDES' sway, who basely slain</br>By TYNDARIS, lewd partner of his bed,</br>At home, in peace, ignobly bled:</br>Nathless thy murd'rous wiles shalt thou deplore,</br>When 'neath th' avenging steel shall stream thy purple gore.</br>"]
