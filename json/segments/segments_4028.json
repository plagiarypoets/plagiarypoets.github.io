["Dear Damon, you bade me to state,</br>Why I thought my Pastora was kind:</br>Attend, dearest friend, I'll relate;</br>For I think I've discover'd her mind:</br>You thought her the queen of the grove,</br>When the lasses all sported in May;</br>And bade me despair of her love;</br>For the charmer, you said, was too gay.", "When Summer danc'd over the green,</br>And Phoebus had lengthen'd his reign,</br>As ev'ning bedew'd the dim scene,</br>I met the fair maid on the plain;</br>Enraptur'd I gaz'd on her charms;</br>She blush'd as I stammer'd my pain;</br>Her bosom heav'd high in alarms</br>As she strove the soft sigh to restrain.", "Next morn, as I stray'd thro' the mead,</br>I heard her soft converse unseen;</br>She said, \"My dear Phillis, indeed;</br>So he told me last night on the green.\"&mdash;</br>Amazement bewilder'd my frame;</br>Confused I was, I'll allow;</br>But when the fair whisper'd my name,</br>I felt &mdash; but I cannot tell how.", "On fair day, a day of much glee,</br>Of ribbands I bought her the best:</br>She promis'd to wear it for me,</br>And wears it till now on her breast.</br>At shearing she pass'd by the stream,</br>And list'ned awhile at my song&mdash;</br>But now I must finish my theme,</br>For I see her come tripping along.</br>"]
