["Dear Chloris, you ask me to name</br>The Cause whence this Sadness appears,</br>The Wretch that has robb'd me of Fame,</br>And left me Repentance and Tears:</br>Oh!  did you the False-one but know,</br>The Arts that he us'd to deceive!</br>You surely would pity the Woe,</br>Which nothing but Death can relieve.", "His Eyes, like the Brightness of Morn,</br>Conjoin'd with the Mildness of Eve,</br>A Chaplet his Brow does adorn,</br>Which I (sad Remembrance!) did weave:</br>Around how the Shepherds would throng,</br>To hear the sweet Accents he sung!</br>For dull is the Nightingale's Song</br>To the Music that falls from his Tongue!", "Ah!  why to a Form so divine,</br>And a Face so enchantingly fair,</br>My Heart did I fondly resign,</br>Nor dream of my future Despair?</br>E'er since he has fled from these Arms,</br>No Tongue my Distraction can tell,</br>But if such &mdash; nay much greater his Charms,</br>What Wonder poor Phyllida fell?</br>"]
