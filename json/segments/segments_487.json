["Lo!  SPRING, array'd in primrose-colour'd robe,</br>Fresh beauties sheds on each enliven'd scene,</br>With show'rs and sunshine chears the smiling globe,</br>And mantles hill and vale in glowing green.", "All nature feels her vital heat around,</br>The pregnant glebe now bursts with foodful grain,</br>With kindly warmth she opes the frozen ground,</br>And with new life informs the teeming plain.", "She calls the fishes from their ouzy beds,</br>And animates the deep with genial love,</br>She bids the herds bound sportive o'er the meads,</br>And with glad songs awakes the joyous grove.", "No more the glaring tiger roams for prey,</br>All-powerful Love subdues his savage soul,</br>To find his spotted mate he darts away,</br>While gentler thoughts the thirst of blood controul.", "But ah!  while all is warmth and soft desire,</br>While all around SPRING's chearful spirit own,</br>You feel not, AMORET, her quickening fire,</br>To SPRING's kind influence you a foe alone!</br>"]
