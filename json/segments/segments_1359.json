["Ye Powers unseen, whose pure aerial forms</br>Hover o'er Cambria's awful mountains hoar!</br>Who breath your fury in her raging storms,</br>And join your deep yells to the tempest's roar,</br>Assist my visionary soul to soar</br>Once more enraptur'd o'er your prospects drear;</br>Let each sensation warm my heart once more,</br>That wont to prompt th' enthusiastic tear,</br>And raise my restless soul when your wild scenes were near.", "Sure ye who viewless range those prospects blest,</br>And swiftly glance o'er many a heath-clad hill,</br>Sure ye oft animate the glowing breast,</br>And often warm with many a mystic thrill</br>The pure poetic fancy! &mdash; Oh!  deign still</br>Those high, those speechless pleasures to renew,</br>Bid memory trace each scenes with faithful skill,</br>And let Imagination's fervour true,</br>With emphasis recal each magic mountain view.", "In all the tedious intercourse of life,</br>Say, is there aught of bliss sublime and high?</br>Amid the fluttering world's unmeaning strife;</br>Say, is there aught to sooth or satisfy</br>The soul aspiring to its kindred sky?&mdash;</br>No! &mdash; Nature, thou alone can'st boast the power</br>To reallume the melancholy eye,</br>Cheer the dejection of the restless hour,</br>And bid advent'rous thought of trackless regions tower.", "If thou, perchance, has ever felt the smart</br>Of unrequited friendship, go and soothe</br>In independence wild thy wearied heart!&mdash;</br>The charm of solitary pleasures prove</br>Ye who the world's cold scorn may sometimes move</br>To curse mankind! &mdash; and ye that doubt and fear,</br>Oh!  see how Nature beams with boundless love!&mdash;</br>The God of Nature shall instruct you there,</br>Dispel the mental cloud, and flash conviction clear.", "And you ye Cambrian hills and vallies sweet,</br>You gave such pleasure to a wearied mind,</br>You fill'd a heart which thought all joy deceit</br>With unfeign'd rapture, and with peace refin'd;</br>Thanks to your charms and glories unconfin'd!</br>Thanks to that God who gave a heart to feel!</br>And may your rude scenes with an influence kind</br>Continue long the wound of care to heal,</br>And warm afresh with joy, Affliction's bosom chill.", "And you, ye shadowy spirits, that unseen</br>All wildly glance those fabled scenes along,</br>Whose solemn voices, oft Night's conscious queen</br>Salute with murmur sweet, and mystic song;</br>May you for him that raptur'd roves along,</br>Or climbs some rock whose fork'd peak cleaves the sky,</br>If chance the powers of verse to him belong,</br>Bid dreams of hallow'd import flutter by,</br>And purge from mortal film, his half-enlighten'd eye.</br>"]
