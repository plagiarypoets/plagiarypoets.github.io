["IDYL.  I.</br>Go festal bark, and Pleasure spread thy sails!</br>Indulgent Trent reflects a lover's smile,</br>And woos with whispering reed such gentle gales,</br>As speed thy course, nor vex his wave the while.</br>Go by the marge of his fair winding vales</br>To yon romantic cliff, whose sainted pile</br>With all its waving oaks thy coming hails!</br>Exulting go &mdash; yet mindful that the fate</br>Of thousand hearts must on thy safety wait,</br>For never Cyprian bark could boast so fair a freight.", "IDYL.  II.</br>Romantic Cliff, in Supersition's day,</br>Whose chamber'd rock was scoop'd by holy hand!</br>Where lost to earth (as Cloyster-Legends say)</br>His church and cell some woe-worn Anchoret plan'd!</br>Yet chose he not a drear ungenial site;</br>See o'er that smooth expanse of pastures green,</br>What giant mountains heave their distant height;</br>While glitters, as he winds, bright Trent between!</br>Those lone and lifted towers, that awe the West,</br>See frowning still o'er Mary's regal woes!</br>And mark that graceful spire above the crest</br>Of yon fair hill, where Mercia's kings repose!</br>Religious cliff!  forgive, with other view,</br>With vow less holy, if our pilgrim train</br>Short sojourn sweet in thy recess renew,</br>Nor deem gay Pleasures festal rites prophane,</br>Where Beauty's smile divine illumes thy rural reign!", "IDYL.  III.</br>Return, lov'd bark, for lo, the falling day,</br>Throws shadowy light athwart Trent's osier'd edge,</br>While hast'ning from the dashing oar away,</br>The timid cygnets seek the sheltering sedge,</br>With misty veil o'erhung! &mdash; Ah, now return!&mdash;</br>Thy simple tent protects a dearer charge,</br>Than Cydnus own'd, when erst his trophied urn</br>Pour'd wavy splendour round that gorgeous barge,</br>Whose silver oars to Lutes Idalian play'd,</br>Whose silken streamers Cupid self unfurl'd,</br>As down his tide the floating pomp convey'd</br>The boast of love and rival of the world.</br>"]
