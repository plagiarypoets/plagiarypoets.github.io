["'Tis sweet employ, with copying hand to trace</br>The scene where happy childhood pass'd away:</br>My house belov'd &mdash; secluded, peaceful place!</br>Where ev'ry heart was innocent and gay,</br>Free from restraint, command, and custom's sway;</br>Permitted each its own pursuit to choose;</br>Amongst romantic solitudes to stray,</br>Touch music's chord, th' absorbing page peruse,</br>Or, in abstraction lone, and tender fancy muse.", "Such were th' employments of my earliest hours;</br>Thus did life's opening current softly flow</br>Through banks of verdure, beauty, shades and flow'rs&mdash;</br>While heaven's pure tint reflected shone below.</br>Yes!  here Devotion's beam first learn'd to glow;</br>Here virtue's sentiments became imprest:</br>Oh!  scenes beloved!  seclusions sweet!  ye know</br>What grand ideas, what emotions blest,</br>Have elevated, charm'd, inspir'd my raptur'd breast!", "Enchanting Nature!  beauty all divine!</br>In whose fair face perfection's features blend;</br>Where ev'ry type of love and wisdom shine&mdash;</br>Ah!  thou wert then my sister and my friend.</br>From thee, no thought removing could I send;</br>For in thy converse, and thy looks so kind,</br>Did joy or sorrow on my heart attend,</br>Alike in both, I still was wont to find</br>The sympathizing charm that sooth'd and bless'd my mind.", "Now from these fairy haunts afar remov'd,</br>And to their visions wild long bade adieu,</br>Do I regret a period so belov'd,</br>And sadly wish its transports to renew?</br>No &mdash; I contemplate them with grateful view;</br>But other blessings dear are now supplied;</br>And while devoted to affection true,</br>And in improvement's course my moments glide,</br>Content, and peace, and hope, within my heart reside!</br>"]
