["IRENE!  fav'rite daughter of the skies!</br>Round whose calm brows immortal graces glow,</br>Desire of Earth!  which from thy smile enjoys</br>The truest happiness perceiv'd below,</br>By thee, the joyful peasant tills the plain,</br>And sees his toils with golden plenty crown'd:</br>By thee secur'd, the merchant braves the main,</br>And visits every coast &mdash; till wealth is found:</br>To thee the shepherd tunes his artless lay,</br>As in the shade he sits &mdash; and feels thy placid ray.", "Around thee, Goddess, endless blessings wait,</br>And man to man in sweet accord unite;</br>Each social virtue joys to form thy state,</br>Reviv'd, Improv'd, and Strengthen'd by thy sight;</br>The cherish'd Muses bless'd beneath thy reign,</br>With gratitude confess thy guardian care,</br>Encourag'd arts compose thy shining train,</br>And ev'ry life-endearing charm is there;</br>E'en on the worthless are thy bounties shed,</br>Pour'd on th' unfeeling heart, and mischief making head.", "For man, unhappy man!  with Pride possess'd,</br>By Passion hurried; with Ambition blind;</br>Forgets thy balmy sweets, and kind behest,</br>To issue forth the foe of humankind;</br>Of heav'n regardless, &mdash; and rejecting thee,</br>He stretches out the self-destroying hand;</br>And breaking from the bonds of nature free,</br>Pollutes, with horrid havock, sea and land:</br>Compelling thee, chaste Goddess, oft to fly</br>To snow-surrounded wastes beneath the polar sky.</br>"]
