["The look is gone, which smiling beam'd to save,</br>And life, alas!  has nought of joy for me;</br>I seek a refuge, in the silent grave,</br>Refuge from time, &mdash; rest for eternity;</br>Oh!  Man, if nought but Love's tempestuous sea</br>Hath bid thee call the tomb, thy haven, fair,</br>And were its waters calm, could'st thou yet be</br>Content to spread thy sails for ever there,</br>Nor waft from Earth a wish, &mdash; nor wing to Heav'n a pray'r.", "Does high ambition form thy daring scheme,</br>A calm seclusion charm thy peaceful breast,</br>Of love more pure than mine, thou can'st not dream</br>Thou durst not hope for more than I possess'd;</br>And if a joy more blissful than the rest,</br>Could spread its bright beams on my view below;</br>Could veil life's future, distant in the west,</br>'Twas woman's smiles in all their dazzling glow</br>When Fate's commission'd hand prepar'd th' unerring blow.", "Do'st thou too love? &mdash; and sum thy pure delight</br>In one blest hope, that bids all others bow,</br>Of all the sorrowing forms, that meet thy sight,</br>Mark well the deadliest cheek, &mdash; the palest brow,&mdash;</br>Mine was the quenchless flame &mdash; the sacred vow&mdash;</br>The love &mdash; that thought not of a parting hour.</br>It crown'd my bliss &mdash; it crowns my sorrow now</br>It is betray'd, but yet retains a pow'r</br>That Death shall find triumphant in my dying hour.", "Do'st thou dare hope! &mdash; ('twill dawn but to deceive)</br>Away, away, with Hope, it seals thy doom;</br>Trust not its promises, if thou would'st live,</br>It sheds a ray, to light thee to thy tomb.</br>Trust not a tear &mdash; it falls but to betray:</br>Trust not a smile &mdash; (however sweet it shone.)</br>Both, both, have bless'd me in a brighter day,</br>And both, alas!  deceiv'd me &mdash; and are gone,</br>And Love no more shall hail their doubtful second dawn.</br>"]
