["A light cloud coronals Benledi's brow;&mdash;</br>Still up the steep ascent be mine to strain,</br>Nor deem the toil as idle.  Oh!  how slow</br>The sluggish hour rolls on; &mdash; but see!  again</br>Peering all-beauteous 'bove the vapoury train,</br>Thy giant form is seen the hills among.</br>Child of the mountain mist!  And now I gain</br>Thy towery height, and muse upon the throng</br>Of countless charms around, and wake the soul to song.</br>"]
