["DEDICATION</br>To ye, fair maids, whose sorrow-tears will flow</br>When conning o'er an artless tale of woe,</br>Who wept with unfeigned grief for Charlotte's doom</br>(A lovely victim in an early tomb),</br>Who bless her memory, and will ne'er forget</br>That Brunswick's Star is now for ever set:</br>What though my hand strays feebly o'er each string,</br>Oh!  deign to hear my harp's sad murmuring;</br>Then listen to the sounds of woe and pain,&mdash;</br>To ye I dedicate this slow and mournful strain.", "CANTO I.</br>The Star of Brunswick's quenched in endless night&mdash;</br>The ray of glory's vanished from the heaven;</br>Though erst it streamed in radiant lustre bright,</br>A sparkling beauty in the mildest even!</br>But far behind the blackest clouds 'tis driven,</br>Shrouded in darkness, hid from mortal eyes,</br>Yet, when yon azure firmament is riven,</br>It then in tenfold lustre shall arise&mdash;</br>Brunswick's bright Star hid only for a season lies.", "Charlotte!  the lines of virtue in thy face</br>Were writ so legible by God's own hand,</br>That not a mortal breathing but could trace</br>Thy deeds, woe soothing, generous and grand:</br>Thou truly wert the noblest in the land,</br>(If virtue is accounted noble now),</br>For thou with wisdom travelled hand-in-hand;</br>Thy title could not grace thee here, but thou</br>Gave lustre to the coronet that clasped thy brow.", "Fondly we gazed upon the nation's gem</br>(A brighter one ne'er graced Golconda's mine)</br>And ardent hoped Britannia's Diadem</br>Would round thy brows for many years entwine:</br>Thou wert the rising hope of all thy line,</br>The Nation's glory, Britain's Darling Child;</br>But oh!  thy virtues, charms, were all too fine,</br>Thy feeling heart too tender and too mild,</br>To dwell in such a world, so stormy and so wild.", "Who would have thought upon a scene like this,</br>When thou wert cradled on thy mother's knee;</br>And marking thee through joys of youth and bliss,</br>Thy people such a sad reverse should see?</br>With holy raptures and true honest glee,</br>They'd vowed allegiance to such worth as thine;</br>Under thy sway the proud, Isle of the Sea</br>Would certes lovelier beamed in splendour fine,</br>E'en though its glories now with such bright lustre shine.", "Anticipation!  thou art fled for ever,</br>And the bright retrospect is all we find:</br>As when proud Britain's fleet the billows sever,</br>They leave a short but brilliant track behind.</br>Yet on such traces we may surely bind</br>The loveliest hope-flower that on earth e'er grew,</br>And wail that such a bud should be entwined</br>With the dark ringlets of the deadly yew,</br>For its expanding days were lovely but were few.", "Charlotte!  when hovering on the verge of time,</br>And every hope was flitting quickly past;</br>Fading so sudden in thy opening prime,</br>Ne'er was the splendour of thy soul o'ercast:</br>While death stood by &mdash; while life itself did last,</br>Thou blessed thy Leopold with many a sigh,</br>With death-locked hands, thou clasped thy husband's fast,</br>And when speech was gone, thy speaking eye</br>Said, \"See with what calm peace a Christian can die.\"", "\"Tell, tell my Leopold,\" the Princess said,</br>Ere yet the damp of death sat on her brow,</br>\"Tell him, from me, his spirits must not fade,</br>For I'm the happiest wife in England now.\"</br>Thus, the sweet sufferer, that he might not bow</br>In sorrow, uttered her love accents mild,</br>Soothing her partner that no tears might flow</br>For her keen pangs, and keener yet, and wild,</br>When to her Britain's heir appeared a lifeless child.", "Matrons of Britain, copy her pure mind,</br>Be ye like her, and all her paths revere;</br>And ye, fair maidens, never will ye find</br>A mark more true, to guide your actions here;</br>Wail, wail her loss with many a heart-wrung tear,</br>An early blighted and a lovely flower;</br>And if ye in her footsteps persevere,</br>They'll aid ye sweetly in your dying hour,</br>Fear, on the death couch, will be stript of all his power.", "The scene is finished, and the curtain closed;</br>Thus, many a cheerful prospect ends in woe;</br>The proudest structure where our hopes reposed,</br>May soon be dashed down by a fearful blow:</br>So lately every hope, with fervid glow,</br>Rose rapid, rapid, with increased delight;</br>But soon the lovely fabric was laid low,</br>And vanished sudden from our eager sight,</br>Wrapt in the dreary whirlwinds and the storms of night.", "And thou, high Scion of the stranger land,</br>Say, to what home of peace canst thou now hie;</br>She bound thee here, with love's own silken band,</br>And was thine own &mdash; the apple of thine eye:</br>Say, where on earth must thou for solace fly</br>From thee, the calm of soul was harshly driven.</br>To Claremont go &mdash; remembrance will rush by,</br>For the calm sunshine of a cloudless heaven</br>Is changed to all the horrors of a stormy even!", "Oh!  she was thine, thou loved her as thy soul,</br>And she returned thy tenderness and care;</br>Far round might ruin and destruction roll&mdash;</br>View Claremont, truest happiness was there.</br>Like Eden's garden, it was spotless fair,</br>Where ne'er a serpent entered, well I wis;</br>As our first parents, they did rapture share,</br>Ere they were driven from the bowers of bliss,</br>And took the last farewell of their own paradise.", "Through the short calm of sweet connubial love,</br>Retired from princely grandeur, pompous noise,</br>With wild ambition ye would never rove,</br>But dwelt with her who was thy only choice:</br>Ye tasted exquisitely the thrilling joys,</br>Which through the souls of faithful lovers swim:</br>But there's a counteracting power employs</br>Mysterious ways, which to us cruel seem,</br>And, Leopold, thy bliss was as a transient dream!", "When kneeling down beside the bed of death,</br>My God!  how trembled thy high spirit then!</br>Ne'er so before, ne'er trembled thy full breath,</br>When standing nobly 'mid the shock of men:</br>And though in heat of battle placed again,</br>With sword in hand engaged in martial strife,</br>Though stretched in agony amid the slain,</br>And felt the deadly throes of ebbing life&mdash;</br>Those pangs are nought compared to parting with thy wife.", "Descending to the mansions of the dead,</br>Thou poured thy sorrows to the midnight air;</br>And where the reliques of thy love were laid,</br>Thou stoodst the living image of despair!</br>That form before thee late so sweet and fair,</br>Deprived of motion, and bereft of breath.</br>The scene was striking!  Oh, that love is rare,</br>Full of attachment, and the purest faith,</br>That pours its griefs e'en in the sleeping room of death!", "Thou'st won the love of every British heart,</br>They've tried to cheer thee in affliction's hour;</br>But difficult the task is to impart</br>Strength to the bruised reed or broken flower;</br>Kings may sink down, and princes' fortunes lower</br>(But God forbid there should be new alarms);</br>If thou wert stript of titles, wealth, and power,</br>I'd then approach (thy worth my bosom warms),</br>And as a friend, a brother, clasp thee in my arms.", "He who hath aimed the blow alone can heal,</br>And He will not forsake thee, Princely One:</br>And that loved angel will watch o'er thy weal,</br>Who hath so lately from thy presence gone.</br>And when in Claremont thou remain'st alone,</br>Thou'lt o'er departed pleasures sadly brood;</br>Yet that will give thy soul a calmer tone&mdash;</br>Like Charlotte, be the first in doing good,</br>And that will soothe thee in thy lonely solitude.", "Farewell, my Prince, may time roll calmly past,</br>'Till grief is mellowed by revolving years;</br>For neither mortal woes, nor pleasures last,</br>And human hopes are dashed by human fears;</br>When thy last step hath pressed this vale of tears,</br>Where thou hast seen thy hopes to ruin driven,</br>Amid the burst of light, from other spheres,</br>Oh!  may a happy welcome then be given,</br>By her who is before thee in the bowers of heaven!", "CANTO II.</br>Unfit am I to wound a British soul,</br>Unfit am I to trace ignoble deeds;</br>Yet albeit I mote well unveil the whole,</br>Though certes whilomwhile my bosom bleeds:</br>And who this sad and rueful story reads,</br>Deigns to refuse a sigh, a pitying tear,</br>Or shroud himself, I wot, in sable weeds;</br>For Charlotte was to every Briton dear&mdash;</br>Her worth was known, and sweetly dwelt on here.", "Oh!  may that day be never known in heaven,</br>When high-born souls were separated, disjoined&mdash;</br>May the \"Recording Angel's\" leaf be riven,</br>Or else by some sweet seraph interlined!</br>And well I wis, that seraph sure may find</br>Some smooth excuse that to us is unknown;</br>A Prince's love is cold as northern wind&mdash;</br>But Providence will soothe that mother lone,</br>Who mourns her daughter's fate, and sadly weeps her own.", "I'm not beholden to a great man's power,</br>And reckless am I of the courtly band,</br>The heaviest malisons may on me shower&mdash;</br>In Scottish phrase, I'll tell my tale aff hand;</br>Shame!  shame!  the highest head in all the land,</br>To bow so lowly in life's gloaming hour&mdash;</br>To spurn his better half was noble, grand!</br>Mayhap it was to please his princely power,</br>Mayhap to gratify some haughty paramour!", "Thus far I venture &mdash; I will not recede&mdash;</br>A Scottish spirit was, and shall be free&mdash;</br>But oh!  my Prince, our mountain bosoms bleed,</br>Though erst attuned to merriment and glee:</br>The nation's glory driven across the sea,</br>Thy bosom-partner through the world to roam!</br>Princess!  an houseless wanderer thou canst be,</br>But what was stately palace, princely dome,</br>When thou wert far away from thy loved daughter's home?", "Say, did the climes of Italy suffice</br>To calm thy soul when Charlotte was not by?</br>Could balmy gales, from where the myrtles rise,</br>Sweep the still tear-drop from thy lovely eye?</br>Methinks I hear that sad heart-rending cry,</br>When the rude messenger proclaimed the death</br>Of her thou lovedst &mdash; and not behold her die;</br>Or hear those sentiments of purest faith;</br>Or fold her in thy arms, and catch her parting breath.", "Though not unskilled in courtly lore, I must</br>Probe the deep gangrene of my country's wound.</br>Where, where, I say, in vilest living dust,</br>Could such cold-hearted apathy be found?</br>Not one relation was there seen around</br>The bed of death, save Leopold alone;</br>The Royal Uncles, with high feasting crowned,</br>Sat reckless of the heirship to the crown,</br>Although each goodly prospect might be overthrown.", "Peace be to thee, my good, my worthy king</br>(A shattered fragment of the olden school),</br>My Northern breast must still be murmuring,</br>When Southern chiefs spend time in sad misrule.</br>Deem not the indignant Bard, ye Chiefs, a fool,</br>Though in the world's broad path he's marked as such,</br>If willing he, some nobles would cry dool,</br>And writhe themselves beneath satiric clutch,</br>He'd wield Uriel's spear &mdash; expose them at the touch.", "Charlotte was thine, thou lovedst her, Farmer George,</br>Humble the title, but it was thine own;</br>Kings may take titles &mdash; kings may titles forge,</br>But mote, I say, thou well became thy throne:</br>Thy peaceful, rural attributes are gone&mdash;</br>A lonely stranger in thy lovely land!</br>But thou for nigh a century hath won</br>Thy lieges' love, for mild was thy command:</br>The sceptre never graced a truer, nobler hand.", "Where was the highest female in the land?</br>Where was the grandame in the trying hour?</br>Was it Apollion's, or God's command,</br>That bade her speed her way on such a tour?</br>Say, say, could eild grace festive hall or bower,</br>Or catch the joy-glance of a youthful eye,</br>While Britain's sweets were mingled with the sour?</br>It was a scene whereat I might say, Fye!</br>Muse on a lonely death-bed, wring my hands, and sigh!", "Grandames are wont in our cold Northern clime,</br>In place of fleeing (as it were) from harms,</br>To spare no hardship, no fatigue, no time,</br>To fly and catch the cherub in their arms:</br>Each aged heart with youthful pleasure warms,</br>They crack fu' couthily on promised bliss;</br>But Southern dames are cold to infant charms,</br>Else the great matron of our land, I wis,</br>Would ne'er give an example, cruel, such as this!", "Indignant bursts the Spirit of the North,</br>His trembling hand points to a misty cloud,</br>Noble his words, if I dare call them forth;</br>But what he breathed mote not be spoke aloud;</br>It was about a strange Egyptian shroud,</br>Wrapt round my Princess, hurried rapidly;</br>But wild ideas on my senses crowd&mdash;</br>I am confused; and yet I can't tell why,</br>For 'tis strange &mdash; a deep hid mystery.", "A mountain heart throbs wild within its plaid,</br>And darts on yonder cloud his eagle eyes;</br>With manly step, short breath, and lofty head,</br>He trims his bonnet in a warlike guise;</br>And yet the cloud still hovers in the skies,</br>Although the Chieftain such a proud look wore!</br>He knows a foe behind the curtain lies,</br>Albeit he mote not eye his shield before,</br>He throws the gauntlet down, unsheathes his gude claymore.", "Sheathe, sheathe thy sword, my Highland Chief, my brother,</br>It will be broken, or my chieftain fall;</br>I grant, I grant that never such another,</br>Could from its scabbard thy bright claymore call;</br>I know thou'dst thrown thy gauntlet to all&mdash;</br>But rest ye, rest ye on thy lovely isle,</br>Forbear from Highland feud, from Highland brawl,</br>Put up thy claymore, Chieftain, whilomwhile,</br>And smile &mdash; but well I know 'twill be a ghastly smile!", "What now avails the deadliest human strife?&mdash;</br>The race is over and the goal is won;</br>Oh!
