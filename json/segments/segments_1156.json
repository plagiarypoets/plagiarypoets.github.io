tear the finish'd work apart,</br>Nor int'rest loose it by his subtlest art:</br>But, strange to tell, if the presiding Power,</br>Who to her Favourite gave this precious dower,</br>If kind SOPHROSYNE could fail to breathe</br>Her vital virtue on this magic wreath,</br>The parts must sever, faithless to their trust,</br>The gold grow dross, and every diamond dust.</br>These Valour follow'd, deck'd with verdant palm,</br>Gracefully bold, majestically calm.</br>A mingled troop succeed, with festive sound,</br>Wisdom with olive, Wit with feathers crown'd;</br>Here, hand in hand they move, no longer foes,</br>Their charms increasing as their union grows;</br>Pure spirits all, who hating mental strife,</br>Exalt creation, and embellish life;</br>All here attend, and, in their Sovereign's praise,</br>Their circling forms the song of glory raise.", "The blest SERENA drinks, with ravish'd ear,</br>The melting music of the tuneful sphere.</br>Now in its close the soothing echoes roll</br>O'er her rapt fancy, and intrance her soul;</br>Her senses sink in soft Oblivion's bands,</br>Till faithful Jenny at her pillow stands,</br>Recalls each mental and corporeal power,</br>While she proclaims aloud the passing hour;</br>And, in a voice expressive of surprise,</br>Too shrill to seem the music of the skies,</br>Informs the startled Fair 'tis time to rise.", ""]
