["Here, 'midst the spoils august, that hoary Time</br>Throws o'er the scene which whilom smil'd so gay;</br>Whilst here the Poet tunes his artless rhyme,</br>And points with moral truth the Doric lay;", "Lo!  to his eyes majestic forms appear,</br>The mail-clad warriors of the days of old;</br>Heroes who hurl'd with manly force the spear,</br>Matrons resplendent in their robes of gold;", "\"O say what purpose,\" they with zeal demand,</br>\"Attracts thy steps to these fast mould'ring walls;</br>What gen'rous purpose activates thy hand,</br>Or to thy pious ear what sainted spirit calls?\"", "To rescue from oblivion's dreary page,</br>Heroes, who rose sublime among their peers;</br>To sing the chieftains of a martial age,</br>To shed o'er Kath'rine's urn a flood of tears.", "For this the Bard, when silence reigns around,</br>Quits the soft pillow of inglorious rest;</br>And 'midst these tow'rs oft hears the solemn sound,</br>The martial murm'rings of the brave opprest.", "No more these walls with minstrelsy resound,</br>The gaudy pageants of a distant day;</br>But here the bat and moping owl are found,</br>And mould'ring turrets intercept the way.", "\"Enough,\" they cry'd, \"thou tread'st on classic ground,</br>Thou paint each portrait with the pen of truth;</br>And shew th' admiring world that gaze around,</br>Kath'rine the mourning bride, and Arthur hapless youth.", "\"Or, if from those to days of brighter hue</br>Thy heart shall lead thee to attune the praise,</br>O'er Britain's Prince thy choicest chaplets strew,</br>And consecrate to George's heir the Muse's purest lays.\"</br>"]
