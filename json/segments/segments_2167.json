["It is most meet and natural the sigh</br>Man heaves, when autumn's winds come wild and drear,</br>When the last lingering blossoms droop and die,</br>And whirl the shrivelled blossoms red and sear.</br>Returning spring, indeed, shall deck the year</br>With flowers and foliage rich as e'er she gave;</br>But these shall never, never re-appear!</br>These never more in gales of summer wave,</br>Adorn the woodland path, or scent the mountain cave.", "All things are mutable.  The strain we heard</br>In yon deep dell, is silent now &mdash; and May</br>Shall wake another strain, another bird;</br>Dead is the former tenant of the spray&mdash;</br>Gone with the leaves and flowers that green and gay</br>Concealed their songster!  Yet fond man believes</br>The world of yesterday the same to-day;</br>And when he grieves at all, he only grieves</br>That in their blight his own he feelingly perceives.", "Yet their blight is not his.  They rise no more:</br>But man shall rise triumphant from the tomb!</br>The judgment-morn shall once again restore</br>The human-flowers death blighted &mdash; to resume</br>In fairer climes far more than former bloom!</br>And that high bloom no future blight shall fear,</br>But flourish still where heaven's own beams illume,</br>And dews supernal water it!  No tear</br>Shall stain the happy cheek in that eternal year!</br>"]
