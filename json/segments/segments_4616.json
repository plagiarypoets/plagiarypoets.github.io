["Dear Laura, how can you behold</br>The sorrow and heart-wasting grief,</br>Which Daphnis now feels, &mdash; and withhold</br>Your smiles, that would give him relief.", "No longer he cares for his sheep,</br>Or tends his fair flock on the hill,</br>Where his goats us'd to browse on the steep,</br>That hangs o'er yon murm'ring rill.", "No longer his pipe cheers the vale,</br>Where careless he often would stray;</br>Where violets scent the soft gale,</br>And the lark hails the new born day.", "Dejected now, sad and forsaken,</br>To the winds he is heard to complain;</br>\"Fair Laura derides me with scorn,</br>And my tears and my sighs are all vain.", "\"How happy I stray'd o'er the plain,</br>When my love met an equal return,</br>When Laura would list to my strain,</br>But alas she has left me to mourn.", "\"Farewel then ye joys of the spring,</br>Farewel, I shall see you no more,</br>To me ye no pleasure could bring,</br>Since I'm slighted by her I adore.\"</br>"]
