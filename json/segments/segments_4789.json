["The heart is melted by the tragic muse,</br>She points the dagger, fills the poisoned bowl,</br>And all the passions which the mind confuse,</br>Which rage in troubled breasts without controul,</br>Which cloud the brow and harrow up the soul,</br>She brings with frowns of darkness on the stage,</br>Black revenge, and hatred's angry scowl,</br>Burns with wild fury, which no smiles assuage,</br>And foams and frets with deep and deadly rage.", "By her we see guilt in its wiles ensnared,</br>And virtue rise with bright unclouded beam,</br>We view the arm of dreadful justice bared,</br>Of hatred vice, and blasts the dark laid scheme,</br>The wicked demon startles from his dream</br>And looks around, with terror-sparkling eyes,</br>And sees of light, a radiant, splendid stream,</br>Then blinded with its rays, in wild surprise</br>Sinks down to shades of gloom, ne'er more to rise.</br>"]
