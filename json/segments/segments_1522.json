["Sweet Poesy, whose soothing power can chace</br>The fiend like forms which all our joys invade,</br>When in thy flowing numbers we can trace</br>Some kindred sorrow, some congenial shade,</br>And learn through thee that all are born to bear</br>Stern disappointment, nurse of keenest woes!</br>Affliction's sorrows and the wounds of care,</br>Which only may be heal'd when life shall close,</br>Thus we but taste what each by turns has known,</br>And find we do not tread affliction's paths alone.", "Thy pleasing images we all admire,</br>Painted by thee solemnity can smile;</br>Thine is the light, the elegant attire,</br>Corinthian hangings round a Gothic pile.</br>When o'er the mind the clouds of fancy low'r,</br>She calls on thee her darkness to illume:</br>And thou has strewed her paths with many a flow'r,</br>And hung thy graceful garlands o'er her gloom.</br>Harmonic strains e'en soothe the sense of pain,</br>Enchant the soul and sorrow's power restrain.", "When morbid melancholy fills the mind,</br>Thine is the rainbow 'midst the clouded sky;</br>The spirit, by thy pleasing sounds confin'd,</br>Forgets its former source of misery.</br>Let virtue ever be thy theme of praise,</br>Let her from thee that recompense receive;</br>She shines resplendent in the poet's lays,</br>Therefore 'tis thine that ornament to give.</br>O then employ thy powers in virtue's cause,</br>And gain thyself and her the world's applause!</br>"]
