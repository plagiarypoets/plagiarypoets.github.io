["Ye nymphs, come attend to my song,</br>Regret your lov'd pastoral swain,</br>Accustom'd to join in the throng,</br>When chearful ye danc'd on the plain.", "Reclin'd at the foot of a thorn,</br>By the side of a murm'ring stream,</br>The woes of a shepherd forlorn,</br>How often have they been his theme.", "The swain that is faithful and true,</br>The nymph that is constant and kind,</br>Who love's disappointment ne'er knew,</br>As often his theme will you find.", "Ye nymphs, that reside on the plain,</br>Attend to the voice of despair;</br>Come mourn for your pastoral swain,</br>And drop to his mem'ry a tear.</br>"]
