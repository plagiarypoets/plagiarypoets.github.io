["Hence, fiend, to where in caverns dun</br>Thee Envy bore to wan Despair,</br>When Phoebus check'd his burning throne,</br>And Chaos rul'd the stormy air;</br>There darkling pine alone;</br>There fret thy heart, and tear thy ragged hair.</br>Go where no smiling beams of Morn</br>Were ever seen to dwell,</br>But Melancholy, midnight-born,</br>Weeps in the shades of hell.</br>Or go where Night and Silence reign,</br>And hoary towers delight thy sight;</br>There in dim covert with the owl complain;</br>There curse the dawning day, and call for endless night.", "Thou fiend accurst, begone:</br>Of fellest fiends the fellest thou!</br>Whose heart at others bliss is heard to groan,</br>But joys malignant at another's woe.</br>When Transport crowns the bowl,</br>In Plenty's gay triumphant day,</br>When tides of wealth in golden billows roll,</br>And Fortune smiles, and wanton Pleasures play;</br>Then rolling eyes of fiercest fire,</br>As lightnings dart before the storms,</br>Thou howl'st thy execrations dire,</br>And tenfold rage thy face deforms;</br>Not want'st within thy grasp the angry sword,</br>And thousand daggers stab obedient to thy word.", "Lo where its flowering boughs,</br>The consecrated laurel rears,</br>Ambitious to bedeck the poet's brows,</br>With impious hand the radiant wreath she tears.</br>And lo, more spiteful still,</br>Fierce from Fame's mouth she pulls the clarion shrill,</br>Scarce yet applied to sound your name,</br>Ye masters of the lyre,</br>Whom gifts of sacred verse inflame,</br>And melodies of fire.</br>Tho' Virtue kindles at your strain,</br>And Fancy feels her own enchantments there;</br>Yet snake like Malice, glaring proud disdain,</br>Stops the dull ear, nor deigns the magic notes to hear.", "Now Slander plies her forky tongue,</br>And Hatred, frightful child of hell;</br>Blind Pride, wild Caprice, join the throng,</br>And angry Spleen, and Satire fell,</br>Impetuous haste along.</br>And far before them send their hideous yell.</br>Safe from this barbarous ravening band,</br>Ah, what shall guard the Muse!</br>How can the gentle fawn withstand,</br>When tyger fierce pursues?</br>Yet oft thro' loneliest den or dell,</br>Unhurt hath holy Virgin sped;</br>No savages 'gainst Chastity rebel,</br>Nor dare profane the gem which Heaven hath sacred made.", "Who heeds the praise or scorn</br>Of Envy, black Tartarian maid?</br>Or those whom doom'd to Ignorance forlorn,</br>Dulness detains benighted in her shade?</br>Their pathless way to tread.</br>Thro' the lone weary wildering maze,</br>Where glimmering gleams at best the gloom bespread,</br>And Truth but shines by starts upon the gaze,</br>But Knowledge guides th' ingenuous mind.</br>Where godlike Truth, whom she adores,</br>Resides in purest glory shrin'd,</br>With Virtue, in immortal bowers:</br>Fame standing near waves high th' applausive bay,</br>And strews with many a wreath the flowery-cover'd way.", "Hail days of heavenly light!</br>Hail fruitful in eternal lays!</br>When every Science starts from shades of night,</br>And all the Arts shine forth in all their blaze.</br>To damp th' high-born Muse,</br>In vain does Malice shed her poison'd dews;</br>Since every Muse, and Muse's son,</br>Still brightening like the Morn,</br>In Glory's dazzling paths shall run,</br>Thro' ages yet unborn.</br>Tho' vapours hide the golden Sun,</br>His living torch again he soon displays;</br>And tho' they shade the land where late he shone,</br>On other lands he shines that bask beneath the blaze.", "O B***e, could thy Muse of fire</br>Transport me to th' Aonian grove,</br>Where all the Muses wake the lyre,</br>And hand in hand the Graces rove,</br>Then would my verse foretell,</br>(For Inspiration thence my breast would swell)</br>What bards on wings of boundless Fame,</br>High as the stars shall fly,</br>And Time resound their sacred name</br>Till Time himself shall die.</br>But, ah, my trembling strains forbear,</br>Such mighty bards, such mighty song;</br>Not all bold Pindar's god-like fury share,</br>Or roll the rapid flood of sounding verse along.</br>"]
