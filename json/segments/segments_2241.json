["You heard some few leaves past Alexis had</br>A Dream that troubled him, and made him sad.</br>Now being come home it 'gan revive a fresh</br>Within his memory, and much oppress</br>The pensive King:  Sylvanus, who you heard</br>Was good at Divinations, had steer'd</br>His course, as fate would have him, then to Court,</br>Belov'd and reverenc'd of the nobler sort,</br>And Sainted by the vulgar:  that that brought</br>The old man thither, was, for that he thought</br>To meet Anaxus there; but he you heard</br>Was otherways employ'd:  the Nobles chear'd</br>Their love-sick King with the welcome report</br>Of old Sylvanus coming to the Court;</br>For he had heard great talk of him before,</br>And now thought long to see him, and the more</br>Because he hop'd to learn from his try'd art,</br>What his Dream meant, that so disturb'd his heart.</br>Sylvanus soon was sent for, and soon came,</br>At his first greeting he began to blame</br>Th' amorous King for giving way to grief</br>Upon so slight occasion, but relief</br>Was rather needful now than admonition</br>That came too late, his mind lack'd a Physician,</br>And healing comforts were to be apply'd</br>Unto his Wounds before they mortifi'd.</br>Sylvanus therefore wish'd him to disclose</br>The troublous Dream he had, and to repose</br>His trust in that strong pow'r that only could</br>Discover hidden secrets, and unfold</br>The riddle of a Dream, and that his skill</br>Was but inspir'd by that great power, whose will</br>By weakest means is oftentimes made known.</br>\"Methought (Alexis said) I was alone</br>By the Sea side noting the prouder Waves,</br>How Mountain-like they swell, and with loud braves</br>Threaten the bounden Shore; when from the Main</br>I see a Turtle rise, the Wings and Train</br>Well-nigh deplum'd, and making piteous moan,</br>And by a mark I guess'd it was mine own;</br>And flying tow'rd me, suddenly a Kite</br>Swoopt at the Bird, and in her feeble flight</br>Soon seiz'd upon her, crying, as I thought,</br>To me for help:  no sooner was she caught,</br>When as an Eagle seeking after prey,</br>Flew tow'rd the main Land from the Isles this way,</br>Aud spying of the Kite, the kingly Fowl</br>Seiz'd on her strait; the Turtle pretty soul</br>Was by this means set free, and faintly gate</br>Upon the Eagles back, ordain'd by fate</br>To be preserv'd:  full glad was I to see</br>Her so escape; but the Eagle suddenly</br>Soaring aloft to Seaward, took her flight,</br>And in a moment both were out of sight,</br>And left me betwixt joy and sorrow; sad</br>For the Birds flight, yet for her freedom glad.</br>Then, to my thinking, I espy'd a Swain,</br>Running affrighted tow'rd me ore the Plain.</br>Upon his wrist methought a Turtle sate,</br>Not much unlike th' other mourning for's Mate:</br>Only this difference was; upon her head</br>She had a tuft of Feathers blue and red,</br>In fashion of a Crown; it did me good</br>To see how proudly the poor Turtle stood</br>Pruning her self, as if she scorn'd her thrall.</br>If harmless Doves can scorn that have no Gall.</br>I was so much in love with the poor Bird,</br>I wish'd it mine, methought the Swain I heard</br>Cry out for help to me:  with that I spy'd</br>A Lion running after him glare-ey'd,</br>And full of rage; fear made the Swain let go</br>The lovely Turtle to escape his foe.</br>The Bird no sooner loose, made to the Beast,</br>And in his curled Locks plats out a Nest.</br>The Beast not minding any other prey</br>Save what he had, ran bellowing away,</br>As over-joy'd; and as methought I strove</br>To follow him I wak'd, and all did prove</br>But a deluding Dream; yet such a one</br>As nightly troubles me to think upon.</br>The pow'rs above direct thee to unfold</br>The myst'ry of it;\" 'twas no sooner told,</br>When old Sylvanus with a chearful smile,</br>Answer'd the King in a familiar stile.</br>\"You are in love, dread Souereign, and with two,</br>One will not serve your turn, look what you do,</br>You will go near to lose them both; but fate</br>At length will give you one to be your mate.</br>She that loves you, you must not love as Wife,</br>And she that loves another as her life</br>Shall be th' Arcadian Queen; take comfort then,</br>The two lost Turtles you will find agen.</br>Thus much my Art doth tell me, more than this</br>I dare not let you know:  my counsel is</br>You would with patience note the working fates,</br>That Joy proves best that's bought at dearest rates.\"</br>He would not name Anaxus, tho he knew</br>He should make one in what was to ensue;</br>And would not hasten sorrow sooner on him,</br>Than he himself would after pull upon him.</br>The King was somewhat satisfied with what</br>Sylvanus told him; and subscrib'd to fate.</br>He puts on chearful looks, and to his Lords</br>No little comfort by his health affords.</br>He sits in Council, and recals those Peers</br>That liv'd conceal'd in Exile many years.</br>'Mongst whom was Rhotus, Memnon, and some others;</br>And tho with cunning his desire he smothers,</br>Yet did he not forget fair Florimel,</br>Of whom my stragling Muse is now to tell.</br>Memnon, you heard, was going to his Child,</br>When the King left him with a heart e're fill'd</br>With Joy and Hopes:  some marks he had espy'd</br>About Alexis, which so fortified</br>His strong conjecture, that he was the man</br>He ever took him for, that he began</br>With youthful chearfulness to chide his Age,</br>That stole so soon upon him with presage,</br>Sweetning his saucy sorrows that had sowr'd</br>Lifes blessing to him; many tears he showr'd</br>With thought of what had pass'd, and tho not sure</br>Alexis was his Son, those thoughts did cure,</br>Or at the least wise eas'd his troubled mind.</br>The good old man no sooner saw his Child,</br>And bless'd her for her Duty, when he smil'd</br>At what he was to say, and glad she was</br>To see her Sire so chearful; to let pass</br>The long discourse between them:  'twas his will</br>She should prepare for Court, chiding her still</br>For mentioning Anaxus; nor did he</br>Give her long time to think on, what might be</br>The cause that mov'd her Father to such haste.</br>But by the way he had given her a taste</br>Of what might follow:  three days were assign'd</br>Her for to get things ready; 'twas his mind</br>It should be so, and Duty must obey:</br>When Fathers bid, 'tis sin to say them nay.</br>Well then he meant to send for her, till when</br>He leaves her to her thoughts, and home agen</br>The joyful old man wends; that very night</br>Before the day prefix'd, the fates to spight</br>Secure Alexis, sent Anaxus thither,</br>And brought his long-sought Love and him together.</br>You know we left him with old Eubolus,</br>A wisely discreet man and studious.</br>In Liberal Arts well seen, and State Affairs,</br>Yet liv'd retir'd to shun the weight of cares.</br>That greatness fondly sues for:  All that night</br>Was spent in good discourse too long to write,</br>He told the Prince the story of the War,</br>And Pourtray'd out Alexis character</br>So to the life, that he was fir'd to see</br>The man he spake of, and disguised he</br>Intended in his thoughts next day to prove</br>The truth of what he heard:  but cruel Jove</br>That loves to tyrannize for pleasure, stay'd</br>His purposed Journey, and unawares betray'd</br>Anaxus to an ambush of sad woes</br>That set on him, when he least dream'd of Foes.</br>Amongst the various discourse that pass'd</br>Between these two, it fortuned at last</br>Eubolus fell in talk of Florimel,</br>And of her Father Memnon, who full well</br>He knew to be a Lemnian, howsoe're</br>He gave it out for otherwise for fear</br>Of double-ey'd suspicion to the Prince.</br>He set his Virtues forth, and how long since</br>He left his native Soil; the Prince conceiv'd</br>Good hope of what he aim'd at, and believ'd</br>By all conjectures that this Memnon might</br>Be banish'd Codrus, whom he meant to right,</br>If ever he was King.  Eubolus went on</br>In praises of him and of Florimel.</br>\"Friend (quoth the Prince Anaxus) canst thou tell</br>Where this fair Virgin is?\"  \"yes,\" he reply'd,</br>\"I can and will, 'tis by yon River side,</br>Where yonder tuft of Trees stands, day then brake,</br>And he might well discern it;\" \"for loves sake,\"</br>Answer'd Anaxus, \"may one see this Maid,</br>That merits all these praises;\" \"yes,\" he said,</br>\"But thro a grate, no man must enter in</br>Within the Cloyster, that they hold a sin:</br>Yet, she hath liberty some time to go</br>To see her Father, none but she hath so.</br>What e're the matter is, unless when all</br>Arm'd with their Bows go to some Festival</br>Upon a noted Holiday, and then</br>These Female Army, out and home agen</br>In comely order marcheth:  th' other day</br>It was my luck to see her, when this way</br>The King came from the Wars, she with her Train,</br>(For she seem'd Captain) met him on this Plain.</br>Her coming thither, as I heard her say,</br>Was for her lifes preserving to repay</br>A debt of thanks she ow'd him:  many words</br>Did pass between them, and before the Lords</br>Most graciously he kiss'd her, and did woe</br>Her for a longer stay; but she in scorn,</br>Or finding him too am'rous, blew her Horn,</br>To call her Troop together; all like Roes</br>Ran swiftly tow'rd their Cloyster, she is fair,</br>And you know Beauty is a tempting snare.</br>Hers is no common one, her very eye</br>That sparkled with a kind of Majesty,</br>Might without wonder captivate a King;</br>But this is too too high a strain to sing.\"</br>It was enough that Eubolus had said,</br>If not too much, to him that throughly weigh'd</br>Each circumstance a kind of jealous fire</br>Stole to his heart, and spurr'd on his desire</br>To see and prove her; taking Pen and Ink</br>He writ his mind, foreseeing (as I think)</br>She might not come alone unto the Grate,</br>And so could not so privately relate</br>(If she should prove Clarinda) his intent.</br>So for an hour in vain to sleep he went,</br>But restless thoughts did keep him still awake,</br>Still musing on the words the old man spake.</br>Well, Sun being up, with thanks he takes his leave</br>Of his kind Host, that did not once perceive</br>Him to be troubled:  with such cunning he</br>Dissembled what had mov'd him, jealousie.</br>His man and he toward the Cloyster go,</br>Casting in's mind what he were best to do</br>To win a sight of her:  his nimble Brain</br>Soon hatch'd a polity, that prov'd not vain.</br>The Cloyster outward Gate was newly ope,</br>When he came there; and now 'twixt fear and hope</br>He boldly enters the base Court, and knocks</br>At th' inner Gate fast shut with divers Locks:</br>At length one came, the Portress, as I guess,</br>For she had many Keys, her stranger dress</br>Much took Anaxus, who ne're saw till then</br>Women attir'd so prettily like men.</br>In courteous wise she ask'd him what he would?</br>\"Fair Dame,\" said he, \"I have been often told</br>(By one I make no question) whom you know,</br>Old Memnon, (to whose tender care I owe</br>For my good breeding) that within this place</br>I have a Kinswoman, that lately was</br>Admitted for a Holy Sister here,</br>My Uncle Memnon's Daughter; once a year</br>As Duty binds me, I do visit him,</br>And in my Journey homeward at this time</br>A Kinsmans love prompted me to bestow</br>A visit on my Cousin; who I know</br>Will not disdain to own me:\"  \"Gentle Sir,</br>Answer'd the man-like Maid, is it to her</br>Youl'd pay your loving tender?\"  \"Yes,\" said he,</br>\"To Florimel if in this place she be?</br>And so my Uncle told me.\"  \"Yes replied</br>The grave Virago, she is here:  Yet, Sir,</br>You must content your self to speak with her</br>Thorough this Grate; her Father comes not in,</br>And by our Laws it is esteem'd a sin</br>To interchange ought else, save words with men.\"</br>\"I ask no more,\" the Prince reply'd agen.</br>\"That cannot be deny'd,\" said she, stay here</br>With patience a while, and do not fear</br>But you shall see her; so away she went,</br>Leaving the glad Anaxus to invent</br>Excuses for his boldness, if by hap</br>She might not prove Clarinda, and intrap</br>Him in a lye:  Clarinda came at last</br>With all her Train, who as along she pass'd</br>Thorough the inward Court, did make a lane,</br>Op'ning their ranks, and closing them again.</br>As she went forward with obsequious gesture,</br>Doing their reverence; her upward Vesture</br>Was of blue Silk, glistering with Stars of Gold</br>Girt to her Waste, by Serpents that enfold,</br>And wrap themselves together, so well wrought,</br>And fashion'd to the life, one would have thought</br>They had been real.  Underneath she wore</br>A Coat of Silver Tinsel, short before,</br>And fring'd about with Gold white Buskins hide</br>The naked of her Leg, they were loose ty'd</br>With Azure Ribbands, on whose knots were seen</br>Most costly Gemms, fit only for a Queen.</br>Her Hair bound up like to a Coronet,</br>With Diamonds, Rubies, and rich Saphyrs set;</br>And on the top a Silver Crescent plac'd,</br>And all the Lustre by such Beauty grac'd,</br>As her reflection made them seem more fair,</br>One would have thought Diana's self were there,</br>For in her hand a Silver Bow she held,</br>And at her back there hung a Quiver fill'd</br>With Turtle-feather'd Arrows:  thus attir'd,</br>She makes towards Anaxus, who was fir'd</br>To hear this Goddess speak; when they came near,</br>Both star'd upon each other, as if fear</br>Or wonder had surpriz'd them; for a while</br>Neither could speak, at length with a sweet smile</br>Grac'd with a comely blush, she thus began.</br>\"Good morrow Cousin, are not you the man</br>That I should speak with?  I may be deceiv'd;</br>Are not you kin to Memnon?  I believ'd</br>My Maid that told me so; he is my Father.\"</br>\"If you have ought to say to me, fair Soul,</br>Answer'd Anaxus; many doubts controul</br>My willingness to answer; pardon me,</br>Divinest Creature, if my answer be</br>Somewhat impertinent; read here my mind,</br>I am Anaxus, and I fain would find</br>A chast Clarinda here:\"  she was about</br>To call the Port'ress to have let her out.</br>But wisely she call'd back her thought for fear</br>Her Virgin Troop might see, or over-hear</br>What pass'd between them, doubts did rise</br>Within her, whether she might trust her eyes.</br>It was Anaxus voice, she knew that well,</br>But by his disguis'd look she could not tell</br>Whether 'twere he or no; all that she said</br>Was, \"I may prove Clarinda too;\" and pray'd</br>Him stay a little, till her short return</br>Gave him a better welcom; all her Train</br>Thought she had fetch'd some Jewel for the Swain.</br>And as they were commanded, kept their station</br>Till her return.  The Prince with expectation</br>Feeds his faint hopes; she was not long from thence,</br>And in a Letter pleads her innocence,</br>Which he mistrusted; now she could not speak</br>But wept her thoughts, for fear her heart should break.</br>And casting o're a Vail to hide her tears,</br>She bid farewel, and leaves him to his fears.</br>With that the Gate was shut:  Anaxus reads,</br>And with judicious care each sentence heeds;</br>And now he knew't was she whom he so long</br>Had sought for; now he thinks upon the wrong</br>His rash mistrust had done her, 'twas her will,</br>What e're he thought of her, to love him still:</br>Nor could th' Arcadian Crown tempt her to break</br>Her promise with Anaxus:  Now to seek</br>For an excuse to gild o're this offence;</br>Yet this did somewhat chear him, two hours thence</br>He was enjoyn'd to come unto a Bower</br>That over-look'd the Wall; and at his hour</br>Anaxus came; there she had often spent</br>One hour or two each day alone, to vent</br>Her private griefs:  she came the sooner then</br>To meet Anaxus, and to talk agen</br>With him, whom yet her fears mis-gave her, might</br>Be some disguised Cheat:  at the first sight</br>She frown'd upon him, and with angry look,</br>A Title that but ill became the Book</br>Wherein her milder thoughts were writ:  \"Are you</br>(Said she) Anaxus?  these loose lines do show</br>Rather you are some counterfeit; set on</br>By some to tempt my honor, here are none</br>That love the world so well to sell her Fame,</br>Or violate her yet unspotted Name,</br>To meet a Kings Embraces, tho a Crown,</br>And that the richest Fortune can stake down</br>Should be the hire; I tell thee sawcy Swain,</br>Whoever sent thee; I so much disdain</br>To yield to what these looser lines import,</br>That rather than I will be drawn to Court</br>To be Alexis Whore; nay, or his Wife,</br>I have a thousand ways to let out life.</br>But why do'st thou abuse Anaxus so?</br>To make him Pander to my overthrow:</br>Know'st thou the man thou wrong'st; uncivil Swain?</br>Thou hast my Answer, carry back disdain.\"</br>With that she was about to fling away,</br>When he recall'd her; loth to go away,</br>What e're she seem'd:  before sh' had turn'd about</br>He pull'd off his false Hair, and cur'd her doubt.</br>\"My dearest Florimel,\" said he, and wept:</br>\"My sweet Clarinda; and hath Heaven kept</br>Thee yet alive to recompence my love;</br>My yet unchang'd affection, that can move</br>But in one Sphere in thee and thee alone,</br>Forgive me, my Clarinda, what is done</br>Was but to try thee, and when thou shalt know</br>The reason why I did so; and what woe</br>My love to thee hath made me willingly</br>To undergo:  thou wilt confess that I</br>Deserve Clarinda's love:\"  poor Florimel</br>Would fain have sooner answer'd; but tears fell</br>In such abundance that her words were drown'd</br>Ev'n in their birth; at length her passions found</br>Some little vent to breath out this reply:</br>\"O my Anaxus, if it be no sin</br>To call you mine, methinks I now begin</br>To breath new life, for I am but your creature,</br>Sorrow had kill'd what I receiv'd from nature</br>Before I see you; tho this piece of Clay</br>My body seem'd to move, until this day</br>It did not truly live:  my Heart you had,</br>And, that you pleas'd to have it, I was glad:</br>Yet, till you brought it home, the life I led,</br>If it were any, was but nourished</br>By th' warmth I had from yours, which I still cherish'd</br>With some faint hopes, or else I quite had perish'd.</br>But time steals on, and I have much to say,</br>Take it in brief, for I'd be loth my stay</br>Above my usual hour should breed suspect</br>In my chaste Sisterhood:  bless'd pow'rs direct</br>Me what to do; my soul's in such a strait</br>And labyrinth of doubts and fears that wait</br>Upon my weakness, that I know no way</br>How to wade out:  to morrow is the day,</br>Th' unwelcom day when I must to the Court,</br>For what intent I know not; to be short,</br>I would not go, nor dare I here to stay,</br>The King so wills it:  yet should I obey</br>It might perhaps undo me; besides this,</br>My Father so commands it, and it is</br>A well becoming duty in a child</br>To stoop unto his will:  yet to be stil'd,</br>For doing what he bids me, a loose Dame,</br>And cause report to question my chaste Fame;</br>'Twere better disobey; a Father's will</br>Binds like a law, in goodness, not in ill.</br>I hope I sin not, that so ill conceive</br>Of th' end I'm sent for; and, can I believe</br>That honor's aim'd at in't?

Alexis willing ear</br>Was chain'd to his discourse; when with a tear,</br>He sigh'd out this reply:  \"I know it well,</br>I would I could do so;\" but tears 'gan swell,</br>Rais'd by a storm of sighs:  he soon had done.</br>Which Rhotus noting, boldly thus went on.</br>\"Most Royal Sir, be comforted, I fear</br>My rude Reproofs affect not your soft Ear,</br>Which if they have I'm sorry, gracious Sir,</br>I ask your pardon, if my Judgment err.</br>I came to cure your sorrows, not to add</br>Unto their heavy weight that makes you sad.\"</br>\"To cure me, Rhotus?  (said Alexis) no,</br>Good man, thou canst not do't, didst thou but know</br>The sad cause whence they spring.  Perhaps I do,</br>Reply'd old Rhotus, and can name it too.</br>If you'l with patience hear me:  chear up then,</br>After these show'rs it may be fair agen.</br>As I remember, when the Heavens were pleas'd</br>To make me your Preserver, you my Guest,</br>(And happy was I that it fell out so)</br>Amongst the many fierce assaults of woe,</br>That then oppress'd your spirit, this was one:</br>When you were private, as to be alone</br>You most affected, I have often heard</br>You sigh out one Thealma; nor have spar'd</br>To curse the Fates for her:  what might she be,</br>And what's become of her?  if I may be</br>So bold to question it, tell us your grief,</br>'The hearts unlading hastens on relief:</br>When sorrows pent up closely in the breast,</br>Destroy unseen, and render such unrest</br>To the Souls wearied faculties, that Art</br>Despairs to cure them:'  pluck up a good heart</br>And cast out those corroding thoughts that will</br>In time undo you, and untimely lay</br>Your honor in the dust.\"  The speechless King</br>Wept out an Answer to his counselling;</br>For, speak he could not, sighs and sobs so throng'd</br>From his sad heart, they had him quite untongu'd.</br>\"Will it not be,\" said Rhotus?  \"then I see</br>Alexis is unthankful; not, that He</br>That once I took him for:  but, I have done.</br>When first I found you on the Rock, as one</br>Left by stern Fate to ruine, well-nigh drown'd,</br>And starv'd with cold, yet Heaven found</br>E'en in that hopeless exigent, a way</br>To raise you to a Crown; and will you pay</br>Heav'ns providence with frowns; for ought you know,</br>She that you sorrow for so much, may owe</br>As much to Heav'n as you do, and may live</br>To make the Joy complete, which you conceive</br>In your despairing thoughts impossible:</br>I say, who knows but she may be as well</br>As you; nay better, more in health and free</br>From head-strong passion?\"  \"Can I hope to be</br>So happy, Rhotus?\"  answer'd the said King:</br>\"No, she is drown'd; these eyes beheld her sink</br>Beneath the Mountain Waves, and shall I think</br>Their cruelty so merciful, to save</br>Her, their ambition strove for to ingrave?\"</br>\"Why not,\" reply'd old Cleon, who till then</br>Had held his peace:  \"'The Gods work not like men;</br>When Reason's self despairs, and help there's none,</br>Finding no ground for hope to anchor on;</br>Then is their time to work.'  This you have known,</br>And Heaven was pleas'd to mark you out for one</br>It meant thus to preserve:  'tis for some end,</br>(A good one too, I hope) and Heav'n may send</br>This happy seed-time such a joyful crop</br>As will weigh down your sorrows, kill not hope</br>Before its time, and let it raise your spirit</br>To bear your sorrows nobly:  never fear it,</br>Thealma lives.\"", "AND HERE THE AUTHOR DY'D, AND I HOPE THE READER WILL BE SORRY.</br>"]
