["What beauteous form fair Lady do I see,</br>With graces shining in pellucid light,</br>Which sparkle bright in fancy's gazing ee,</br>And erst with glare o'erwhelm the wearied sight;</br>While as I near approach the vision bright,</br>Thy angel form discloses to my view,</br>Beyond the semblance of that lovely spright,</br>In charms transcendent and for ever new,</br>Transmitting heav'nly rays from their etherial hue.", "The more divinely beautiful thou art,</br>Lady of beauty's treachery beware,</br>Watch with unceasing vigilance thy heart,</br>And guard thy charms ev'n with an angel's care,</br>From lightest breathings of unhallowed air</br>Flatt'rys foul breath opposed to guileless praise,</br>Will the pure light of innocence impair,</br>When upon thee the eye presumes to gaze,</br>Where loveliness and grace do ravish it always.", "Yet all how frail but virtues of the soul!</br>Unchanging these, beyond the reach of time,</br>While the full tides of ages onward roll,</br>Their beauty keep in undecaying prime,</br>And still perfecting in that genial clime,</br>Where heavenly spirits dwell and saints of light,</br>And kings and priests and mighty seraphim;</br>Appalling guilt with radiance flashing bright,</br>Who holy are and terrible to mortal sight.", "Lady, forgive this feeble lay from one,</br>Who feels the sovereign force of virtue's power,</br>In her whose sunlike path is but begun,</br>To shine yet more unto the perfect hour.</br>With me, alas!  on whom the skies do lour,</br>With angry frown &mdash; as most unworthy thee;</br>There scarce remains a solitary flower,</br>Of joy, or hope, within my breast to be&mdash;</br>For ruthless is the storm that turns its rage on me.</br>"]
