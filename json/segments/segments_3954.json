["What nature, alas!  has denied</br>To the delicate growth of our isle,</br>Art has in a measure supplied,</br>And winter is deck'd with a smile.</br>See Mary what beauties I bring</br>From the shelter of that sunny shed,</br>Where the flow'rs have the charms of the spring,</br>Though abroad they are frozen and dead.", "'Tis a bow'r of Arcadian sweets,</br>Where Flora is still in her prime,</br>A fortress to which she retreats,</br>From the cruel assaults of the clime.</br>While earth wears a mantle of snow,</br>These pinks are as fresh and as gay,</br>As the fairest and sweetest that blow,</br>On the beautiful bosom of May.", "See how they have safely surviv'd</br>The frowns of a sky so severe,</br>Such Mary's true love that has liv'd</br>Through many a turbulent year.</br>The charms of the late blowing rose,</br>Seem grac'd with a livelier hue,</br>And the winter of sorrow best shows</br>The truth of a friend, such as you.</br>"]
