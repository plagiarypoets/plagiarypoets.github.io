["Enshrin'd in your bosoms of snow,</br>There's a sweet little cherub, my dear,</br>Tis Sympathy call'd, and we know</br>It brightens Humanity's tear.", "A gift the most lovely and fair</br>That Heaven on mortals bestows,</br>It pilots the pilgrim of care,</br>Repulsive of sorrow and woes.", "Poor pale-ey'd Distress I descried,</br>And Merit on Misery's bed,</br>By Opulence surly deny'd</br>A scrap of superfluous bread.", "Then I saw her dove-sembled descend</br>To succour poor pale-ey'd distress;</br>Benevolence, sweetly extend</br>And Merit, tho' wretched, caress.", "So dew-dropping dawnings of morn</br>Pervade Nature's mantle so dark,</br>Rekindle o'er landskips forlorn,</br>Of life and of light the warm spark.</br>"]
