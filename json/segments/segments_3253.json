["Immers'd in the vale of Despair,</br>Despondent and pensive I stray,</br>No pleasures contented I share,</br>No more can be joyous and gay;</br>Adieu then ye eglantine bow'rs,</br>Ye groves and ye vallies so fine;</br>Adieu ye sweet shrubs and ye flow'rs,</br>Thro' sadness your charms I resign.", "Adieu all ye sports of the plain,</br>No more your diversions invite;</br>Adieu to the pastoral strain,</br>As now it ne'er yields me delight:</br>Adieu to my pipe and my crook,</br>My sheep and my lambkins adieu!</br>All pastime your shepherd's forsook,</br>Nor longer is watchful of you.", "Adieu ye sweet birds of the vale,</br>No more in assemblage ye please;</br>No more I attend to your tale,</br>Since I am deprived of ease:</br>For Phillis has left me in woe,</br>And calls me a wretch of disdain;</br>I'm jeer'd too wherever I go,</br>Thro' the jest that she makes of my pain.", "But oh!  was she like me distrest,</br>By a youth who to her was unkind,</br>She'd pity the pangs in my breast,</br>To give some relief to my mind:</br>Nor thus overwhelm me with care,</br>Nor smile as dejected I rove,</br>Nor cause me to pine and despair,</br>And die a poor victim to love!</br>"]
