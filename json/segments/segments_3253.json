["Of wasteful Havock, and destructive Fate,</br>I sing the Tragick Scene, a mournful Tale!</br>Yet call no slaughtering Hero to my Aid,</br>To strew my bloodless Verse with mangled Foes,</br>A lower Theme befits my humble Pen,</br>A Torrent spilt, but not of human Gore,</br>Ruin'd, deform'd, but not of Man erect.</br>Oh Heaven born Muse!  (for Muse I must invoke,</br>Or Mistress fair, for Fashion or for Need)</br>Deign to describe the memorable Fall</br>Of Chloe's P&mdash;s Pot, so by mortals height,</br>The Vessel was, howe'er uncouth the Sound,</br>And veil'd by modest Maids in gentler Terms.</br>Like Rome, the Mistress of the World it fell,</br>From its own Greatness only not secure.</br>Say first what Colour stain'd its vaulted Sides,</br>Lest heedless Bards mistake th' important Truth,</br>And speak as Fancy leads, or Rhyme commands;</br>One shall term it white as Silver Swans,</br>That proudly stem Meander's strenuous Streams,</br>And spotless Innocence, or new fall'd snow,</br>That spreads its Plume on Atlas bleaky Head,</br>Shall suffer Blemish in the wrong compare.</br>Another humorous sports, and jeers its Hue,</br>Earthy and course of Substance, indigest;</br>How apt are Men by devious Errors led,</br>To wander various wide alike from Truth,</br>A sickly Pale languish'd i' th' inner Round;</br>Such as betrays the want of Love-sick Maids.</br>Foe to the Rosy Cheek and Coral Lip,</br>But flies the vigorous Touch of warmer Man.</br>Smooth were its Sides, but from the Bottom rose</br>A manly Head, imboss'd for Hero meant;</br>No question fam'd for Arms and ancient Stem.</br>Such Honours the well meaning Vulgar pay,</br>The Fame of gallant Men, and waste their Skill,</br>On high hung Signs, and Earth of common use,</br>What Blushes did the virile Image cost.</br>The harmless Maid, fearful, least so employ'd,</br>The amorous Stone shou'd soften into Life,</br>As Earst Pigmalions marble Mistress chang'd;</br>Her Parian Substance by less motive sway'd,</br>Without a Cer'lous Dye betstrew'd the Urn;</br>And on the swelling Surface, Flora's Pride,</br>The Lilly and the gawdy Tulip smil'd;</br>Fed with th' briny Nectar it contain'd.</br>One Handle held the Vessel, arch'd and smooth,</br>But for its weighty Purpose far unfit:</br>Here Weakness lurk'd in comely Form disguis'd,</br>Hence the sad Source and Root of all our Woes.</br>Imprudent Man too often trusts his Fate,</br>To one smooth Friend that shrinks when nearly try'd.</br>The unsuspecting Fair One seldom fail'd,</br>At Morn and Even to dew its spacious Womb,</br>At Morn her first, at Even her latest Act.</br>How oft hath it flow'd with Maiden Streams,</br>Fam'd for rare Virtues, and but rarely found.</br>'Twas with this Magick Stream Diana spread</br>The branchy Horns on bold Acteon's Brow.</br>Th' Well e'er since a secret Power retains,</br>On human Foreheads Antlers to convey.</br>'Twas now the heavy Period fix'd by Fate,</br>Hasten'd apace with evil Mischief fraught.</br>'Tis true no Comet stream'd terrifick Blaze,</br>Nor Thunder crack'd sinister roar'd presage;</br>Not but a crazy Sound gave certain Proof</br>Of hidden Crack, foreboding wider Wounds,</br>Yet 'scap'd Suspicion, Foresight ever fails,</br>When unavoided Ruin is decreed.</br>The feeble Sun aray'd with lifeless Flames,</br>Inn'd at the bearded Goat, and drove his Carr,</br>Extinguish'd heavy, half the Tour of Heaven,</br>And Winter keen of Breath blew shivering Cold,</br>Around the Globe, and ty'd the voluble Streams.</br>Some to Chimneys warm Protection fly,</br>And fright the sooty Hearth with dreadful tale,</br>Of spright Nocturnal or adventrous Knight;</br>Some bid defiance to th' inclement Air,</br>Fir'd with the juicy flame of old Talerne.</br>Amidst a jovial Crew fair Chloe quaffs</br>With loud Carouse, till fated Nature crav'd,</br>Timely relax, distent with liquid Pain.</br>Alone she lifts the Jordan to her Aid,</br>When strait a hideous Dinn 'gan roar aloud,</br>Wave dash'd on Wave, Deluge on Deluge fell,</br>And curl'd the circling Eddy to the Brim.</br>Whole Cataracts at once discharg'd fell down,</br>With violent Gush, and drove the steep Cascade,</br>'Till weary of its Load, the lab'ring Urn,</br>Flew from its Hold, a horrid Burst ensues,</br>And mangled Limbs bestrew'd the drownded Floor.</br>Not louder roar'd the three edg'd Bolt of Heaven,</br>When form'd by Vulcan, or when thrown by Jove.</br>Forth from the broken Shreds a tepid Sea</br>Rolls angry foam, and smokes along the Plain,</br>Part of the Stream with slow and winding Pace,</br>Sunk unobserv'd in narrow Crannys lost;</br>Part murmuring crowding at the Portal wide,</br>That ope's the mazy way that wand'ring leads</br>To th' ancient Cave of Earth protected Mice.</br>The Race exiguous, uninur'd to wet,</br>Their Mansions quit, and other Countries seek.</br>Thus fell the Jordan that had long withstood,</br>Firm and resolv'd the mighty shock of Waves,</br>Which lost their Strength, and beat its Shores in vain.</br>'Till at the approach of one impetuous Tide,</br>Fate took the Occasion, and confirm'd its Doom.</br>So the fam'd Edistone near Plymouth Port,</br>Sure mark to wand'ring Ships when lost in Night;</br>Contemn'd the Billows rowling round its Sides,</br>And mock'd their Sports, till on a fatal Night,</br>The Winds blew loud, the enrag'd Billows roar'd,</br>And plung'd the Pharo's in th' vast Abyss.</br>"]
