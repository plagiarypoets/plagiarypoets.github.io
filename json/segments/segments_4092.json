["Through forest paths, o'erstrew'd with rustling leaves,</br>October comes, to deck the fading year;</br>And of its spoil a varied chaplet weaves,</br>Erelong to hand on pallid Autumn's bier.</br>The dew-drop on his brow congeals;</br>His golden locks the wood-blast steals;</br>The scattering wind his chequer'd mantle rends,</br>And o'er his form the tempest-cloud impends.", "Pale are the flowers that thinly plant his way;</br>The gelid drops o'ercharge their closing bells;</br>Their tissued wardrobe falls in quick decay;</br>And nightly cold their blushing grace dispels.</br>Their drooping heads the frost-star gems;</br>The whirlwind shakes their pensile stems:</br>Their transient bloom they shortly must resign,</br>And with their relics mark the year's decline.", "The purple-vested Morn her hour delays,</br>And lingering seems with doubtful mien to rise:</br>Gold-sceptered Day a shorten'd visit pays,</br>And Night with rave crest usurps the skies.</br>With early beam, the vesper star</br>Flames on Twilight's misty car:</br>And swiftly to the chambers of the West,</br>The crimson-curtain'd Evening sinks to rest.", "In wizard forms the dusky vapours float,</br>And veil the woodlands in their dim disguise;</br>The Robin trills his solitary note,</br>And tunes in warbling plaint his elegies:</br>The orphan beauties of the year</br>In melancholy train appear;</br>Pay their last mournful tribute to its shade,</br>And o'er its desolated ruins fade.", "For soon the wheels of Winter's icy car</br>Shall crush these fragments of the shatter'd year;</br>Ev'n now, his hollow murmurs, from afar,</br>Proclaim the fury of his empire drear.</br>The echoing blast, his herald, blows;</br>His meteor torch blue-tinctur'd glows;</br>For Nature's sleep he weaves a snowy vest,</br>And soon shall rock her languid frame to rest.", "The curl'd leaf, flitting on the blast,</br>The moaning gale, the shadowy sky,</br>Denote the Sun's dominion past,</br>And shades of northern darkness nigh:</br>For Sirius gems the zone of night,</br>And, clad in giant armour bright,</br>Orion, Winter's sentinel, ascends,</br>And o'er the sleeping world his watchful light suspends.</br>"]
