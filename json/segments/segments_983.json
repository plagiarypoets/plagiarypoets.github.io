["Daughter of Night, chaotic Queen!</br>Thou fretful source of modern lays;</br>Whose subtle plot, and tedious scene</br>The monarch spurn, the robber raise&mdash;</br>Bound in thy necromantic spell,</br>The audience taste the joys of hell;</br>And Britain's sons indignant groan</br>With pangs unfelt before at crimes before unknown.", "When first, to make the nations stare,</br>Folly her painted mask display'd,</br>Schiller sublimely mad was there,</br>And Kotz'bue lent his mighty aid&mdash;</br>Gigantic pair!  their lofty soul,</br>Disdaining reason's weak controul,</br>On changeful Britain sped the blow,</br>Who, thoughtless of her own, embrac'd fictitious woe.", "Aw'd by thy scowl tremendous, fly</br>Fair Comedy's theatric brood;</br>Light satire, wit, and harmless joy,</br>And leave us, dungeons, chains, and blood;</br>Swift they disperse, and with them go</br>Mild Otway, sentimental Rowe,</br>Congreve averts th' indignant eye,</br>And Shakspeare mourns to view th' exotic prodigy.", "Ruffians in regal mantle dight,</br>Maidens immers'd in thought profound,</br>Spectres that haunt the shades of night,</br>And spread a waste of ruin round:</br>These form thy never varying theme,</br>While buried in thy Stygian stream,</br>Religions mourns her wasted fires,</br>And Hymen's sacred torch low hisses and expires.", "O mildly o'er the British stage,</br>Great Anarch, spread thy sable wings;</br>Not fired with all the frantic rage,</br>With which thou hurl'st thy darts at kings,</br>(As thou in native garb art seen)</br>With scatter'd tresses, haggard mien,</br>Sepulchral chains, and hideous cry,</br>By Despot arts immur'd in ghastly poverty.", "In specious form, dread Queen, appear</br>Let falsehood fill the dreary waste,</br>Thy democratic rant be here,</br>To fire the brain, corrupt the taste.</br>The fair, by vicious love misled,</br>Teach me to cherish, and to wed,</br>To low-born arrogance to bend,</br>Establish'd order spurn, and call each outcast friend.</br>"]
