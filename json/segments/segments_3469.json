["How mistaken are all who suppose,</br>When wedded their joys will be o'er;</br>For many years I now have been wed,</br>And was never so happy before.", "How pleasing in the eglantine bow'r,</br>In the heav'nly sweet month of May,</br>With my lovely fond partner to sit,</br>And my pratt'ling young bantlings to play.", "O!  how pleasing to hear their fond talk,</br>How engaging to see their fond ways;</br>To find their knowledge and love both increase,</br>As kind heaven prolongeth their days.", "Here the lark's shrillest notes we can hear,</br>And Philomel's rapturous strain;</br>View the lambs skip and play round their dams,</br>Which gives joy and delight to each swain!", "There's no pleasure in life can surpass,</br>That known in an union of hearts;</br>For all sorrow and sadness then flies,</br>And joy each transaction imparts.", "Grant, Heavens!  that I thus may be blest,</br>Whilst I'm suffer'd to live here below;</br>So shall my heart and tongue, O my God!</br>With praises continually flow.</br>"]
