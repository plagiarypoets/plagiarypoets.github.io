["The fold is still, the shepherd finds repose,</br>The dews of night, fall, silent, on the shade,</br>Slumb'ring, the tardy streamlet, softly flows,</br>And cruel DAPHNE sleeps, unfeeling maid!</br>But ah!  what sleep can lull my waking woes,</br>Nor peace, nor holy rest, this tortur'd bosom knows.", "Fair SLEEP, if nought avails thy leaden wand,</br>To soothe my weary'd sense, my throbbing breast;</br>Beck, some kind Vision, with thy fairy hand,</br>Some shape fantastic, lovelier then the rest;</br>On DAPHNE's brow to take her tranquil stand,</br>With pow'r, prevailing ardors, to command.", "Ah!  gentle spirit, tell her how I weep,</br>How, thorns implant my pillow, Love's keen thorns,</br>How, madly wild, and trembling pale, he burns,</br>Now, haunted by despair, now, musing deep;</br>Who feels her chain, and calls the ling'ring Sun,</br>To see that face, once more, by which he was undone.</br>"]
