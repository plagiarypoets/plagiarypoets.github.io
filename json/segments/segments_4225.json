["While blest with the smiles of my fair,</br>What transports I felt at my heart!</br>With mine what delights could compare,</br>'Till forc'd from my Phillis to part:</br>Tho' far from the charmer remov'd,</br>Her image still dwells on my mind;</br>With sighs I reflect how we lov'd,</br>How beauteous she was and how kind:", "Each day I revisit the glade,</br>Or seek the retreats of the grove;</br>Where oft with my Phillis I stray'd,</br>And told the soft tale of my love:</br>Each tender endearment I try'd,</br>With fondness she strove to outdo;</br>And still in soft contest we vy'd</br>Whose flame was most lasting and true.", "How frequent I rose with the morn,</br>And e'er to my charmer I hy'd,</br>For flow'rets, her breast to adorn,</br>I robb'd the gay mead of its pride;</br>How sweet the reward of my toil,</br>When the nymph I so tenderly lov'd;</br>The present receiv'd with a smile,</br>And all my fond labours approv'd.", "No blossom, 'tis true might compare</br>With the roses display'd on her cheek;</br>Nor lily, or snowdrop so fair</br>To equal the hue of her neck:</br>Yet one half in her bosom she plac'd,</br>And forming a wreath with the rest;</br>The head of her shepherd she grac'd;</br>Was ever fond shepherd so blest!", "But now my dear Phillis is gone,</br>These transports no more I enjoy;</br>With her all my comforts are flown,</br>My passion no time can destroy:</br>Kind fortune, thy aid I implore</br>These moments of bliss to regain,</br>Oh!  send back the nymph I adore,</br>Or to her conduct her fond swain.</br>"]
