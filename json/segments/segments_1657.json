["Dark-smiling Maid, I love thee well,</br>For thou art not the flaunting fair</br>Who makes externals all her care,</br>Content to seem what others are;</br>No, lovely mistress of the spell,</br>Thy charms are soft, and all prevail,</br>Tho' shrouded in a mystic veil,</br>Conceal'd indeed from vulgar eyes,</br>The more we know, the more we prize,</br>The better seen, the better lov'd,</br>The deeper search'd, the fairer prov'd,</br>Enchantress!  who thy charms can tell?</br>Dark smiling maid!  I love thee well.", "About thy cave the fairies bound,</br>And dance their gay fantastic round,</br>And shadowy circles form,</br>While riding through the midnight air,</br>Come goblins gaunt, and sylphids fair,</br>And spirits of the storm;</br>And oft they form a warbling choir,</br>And strike the little elfin lyre,</br>While to their melodies divine,</br>I sweep these wandering wires of mine,</br>These feeble strings whose lowly lays</br>But mock the hand that o'er them strays.", "Charmer!  'tis true thy beauties fade,</br>When low thy votary's head is laid</br>They cannot animate anew;</br>Are dimly seen, and quickly past,</br>Yet are they lovely while thy last,</br>And unpolluted too:</br>And since so many joys are vain,</br>And life has less of joy than pain,</br>Oh!  who shall blame amid the maze,</br>Th' enthusiast, who delighted strays?</br>Thou, thou alone, couldst reconcile</br>Those form'd to differ and revile,</br>And honour Truth, thy heavenly nest,</br>Yet press fair Fiction to thy breast.</br>Hail, Truth and Fiction!  loveliest pair,</br>Best, brightest, most divine, most fair,</br>Long, long, each ranked in adverse throng,</br>And shunned, and scorned, and hated long:</br>At length she came, the dark-haired maid,</br>In robes of cloudy blue arrayed,</br>With girdle formed of wandering rays,</br>Caught from the sun's refulgent blaze,</br>And that mysterious veil, so wrought</br>By artful spirits heavenly taught,</br>Its mystic beauties only yield</br>To the fair features it concealed.</br>Th' Enchantress came, she came in pow'r,</br>Mistress of that transforming hour,</br>She breath'd a wild mysterious lay,</br>And sang and smiled their hate away.</br>O'er Truth's fair form a robe she threw,</br>To clothe her with attraction new,</br>And plucked from Fiction's pinions gay,</br>The vainer, gaudier plumes away,</br>Then bade her re-assume her pride,</br>And soar as lofty, not as wide:</br>Each paused, each strange affection knew,</br>And wondered whence their hatred grew,</br>Felt fresh delight, beheld new charms,</br>And sunk into each other's arms.", "Since then together will they stray,</br>And sing the same impassioned lay,</br>The flower that Fiction's garden drest,</br>Blushes on Truth's celestial breast;</br>The wires that Truth has strung rejoice,</br>In unison with Fiction's voice;</br>They seek the same romantic groves,</br>Each loves the haunts the other loves;</br>They climb the steep, explore the dell,</br>Together roam, together dwell.", "Hail, loveliest pair; hail, happiest hour</br>And hail, all hail, transforming power;</br>There's many a willing tribute paid,</br>In Virtue's bane and Vice's aid;</br>There's many a garland gay supplied,</br>For baseness, luxury, and pride.</br>For me!  the song I raise shall be</br>Devoted to the Muse and thee;</br>My garlands shall not, cannot twine</br>Around a brighter brow than thine;</br>I'll breathe thy praise, while praise has breath,</br>I'll love and cherish thee till death;</br>Till then I'm garlanding thy brow,</br>Till then I'll honour thee as now,</br>And then &mdash; farewell, dissolving spell,</br>Dark smiling maid!  farewell, farewell!</br>"]
