["Mild shone the vernal evening bland,</br>And scarce a zephyr sigh'd.</br>When thus to hail my native land</br>In patriot strains I tried:</br>What bliss, unrival'd soil, is thine!</br>What charms on every side combine!</br>Hark!  what accents strike mine ear!</br>\"Plenty, plenty triumphs, here:\"&mdash;</br>Hill and valley, wood and plain,</br>All proclaim far Freedom's reign;</br>Genius and taste they sons endue;</br>And oh, ye matchless nymphs, what beauties bloom in you!", "Nor less the virtues grace thy youth,</br>The virtues all are thine;</br>Untainted honour, artless truth,</br>And charity benign:</br>Where else arise such kind abodes</br>For all whom fell disease corrodes?</br>Lo, the gates wide open stand,</br>Enter in, afflicted band!</br>Science there, with potent balm,</br>Waits each throbbing pang to calm;</br>O, ne'er avert thy partial smile,</br>Philanthropy divine, nor quit thy fav'rite isle!", "What nation else so nobly pleads</br>The cause of injur'd right;</br>So execrates oppressive deeds,</br>And arbitrary might?</br>Scarce had I spoke, when o'er my view</br>A sudden veil soft slumber drew;</br>Sinking on a flowery bank,</br>Underneath a willow lank,</br>By a shrilly-tingling sound</br>Sweetly lull'd, I press'd the ground;</br>But fancy still attending, kind,</br>With many fairy forms amus'd my wond'ring mind.", "What means yon cloud, with skirts so bright,</br>Slow fading o'er the hill?</br>The sun has long withdrawn his light,</br>And every gale is still:</br>Perhaps it bears some courteous sprite,</br>That comes to set the wanderers right,</br>And with kindly streaming rays</br>Cheer the dark and tangled ways,</br>Till again the lunar beam</br>Light the wood, and gild the stream;</br>Or rather, of empyreal race,</br>Some friendly pow'r descends on embassy of grace.", "Near and more near the vision drew,</br>Till o'er my head it hung;</br>Prone on the green turf at the view</br>My trembling limbs I flung:</br>But soon a voice, more softly clear</br>Than fairy songs, dispell'd my fear:</br>\"Rise, behold the friend of man,\"</br>Thus th' angelic voice began;</br>\"Lo, I come, with soften'd light,</br>Temper'd to thy weaker sight;</br>Fear not, for ever by my side</br>Benevolence and Peace and Liberty abide.\"", "I look'd &mdash; and lo!  in white attir'd,</br>A female form reclin'd,</br>Whose looks th' expanding heart inspir'd</br>With love of purest kind:</br>Yet in those looks was plainly seen</br>A deep regret that prey'd within;</br>Sudden from within the cloud</br>Harmony celestial flow'd;</br>Shapes cherubic round me play'd,</br>Heav'nly fragrance fill'd the shade;</br>While thus the pow'rs, in accents mild,</br>\"Philanthropy, thou seest Religion's duteous child.\"", "\"When interest first, and discord dire</br>Usurp'd the mental throne,</br>From Heav'n's blest bow'rs th' Almighty Sire</br>In pity sent me down.</br>But, ah!  in vain I fondly strive</br>To keep the sparks of love alive:</br>Pride, impatient of control,</br>More and more obdures the soul;</br>Avarice vile, my deadliest foe,</br>Daily finds her empire grow;</br>And, oh!  I see, with grief sincere,</br>Still foremost in her train Britannia's sons appear!", "\"See where on Afric's groaning coast,</br>The nation prais'd so high,</br>(Say wilt thou yet that nation boast?)</br>These fellow-mortals buy.</br>Exil'd from all that gladdens life,</br>Friends, parents, country, children, wife,</br>Seest thou not the drooping band?</br>Lo, they drag them to the strand!</br>Now the breeze distends the sail;</br>Hear'st thou not the frantic wail?</br>Happy, if, on the wat'ry way,</br>Each stifled wretch expires, to sharks a destin'd prey!", "\"Turn next to Eastern climes thy view,</br>Ah climes remote in vain!</br>Ev'n there thy sons, O Albion!  too</br>Pre-eminence maintain;</br>But 'tis in fraud's felonious feats,</br>But 'tis in rapine's blood-stain'd seats:</br>Lo, where'er the strangers tread,</br>Grim extortion rears his head;</br>Rape and murder swell the train;</br>Ravenous pillage sweeps the plain:</br>While close behind, with tyrant scorn,</br>Fell famine taunting points at Plenty's ransack'd horn.", "\"Yet these are they whose boundless worth</br>Leaves all applause behind:</br>These are th' enlighten'd of the earth,</br>The liberal and the kind:</br>Yes, these are they, who, void of shame,</br>The nicest sense of honour claim;</br>Burst, ye winds, your rocky caves,</br>Whelm their treasures o'er the waves,</br>That the glitt'ring guilty spoil</br>Ne'er may reach their natal soil,</br>To shut corrupted judgment's door,</br>And say to injur'd right, submit, for thou art poor.", "\"But now adieu, I haste to know</br>If yet one breast remains,</br>Which, like my Burke's, th' exalted, glow,</br>The zeal of humane retains.\"</br>She ceases &mdash; lo, she fleets away,</br>Ah yet awhile, celestial, stay!&mdash;</br>Vain my pray'r &mdash; along the skies</br>Swift the lessening glory flies;</br>Faint and fainter fast  it grows;</br>Now the last &mdash; last glimpse I lose&mdash;</br>Yet still it shines in fancy's eye;</br>Still on his listening ear th' etherial accents die&mdash;</br>"]
