["In the realms of Arcadia, the dwelling of Peace,</br>Why hides ev'ry shepherd his face bath'd in tears;</br>While the flocks, unattended, their playfulness cease,</br>And nought but dejection and sorrow apears.</br>Ah me!  good Palemon, the prince of our plain,</br>Lies rack'd by disease on the sad bed of pain.", "The innocent lambkins that frisk'd to the sound</br>Of the pastoral pipe, as it tunefully play'd,</br>Now languid recline, with their dams, on the ground,</br>And bleat to perceive it neglectfully laid!</br>They know not, Palemon, the prince of our plain,</br>Lies rack'd by disease, on the sad bed of pain.", "The breath that with melody fill'd the sweet pipe,</br>Alas, pretty dears!  is exhausted in sighs;</br>Our master, in kindess, to virtue so ripe,</br>In sickness, despair, and in agony lies!</br>Ah me!  good Palemon, the prince of our plain,</br>Lies rack'd by disease, on the sad bed of pain.", "Yet the pipe's softest melody still will we try,</br>In mournful effusions to him that can heal;</br>Whose goodness regards ev'ry tear, ev'ry sigh,</br>Whose mercy may doom us no longer to feel!</br>No more, good Palemon, the prince of our plain,</br>Lies rack'd by disease, on the sad bed of pain.", "Then again shall Palemon's blest subjects rejoice,</br>And the lambkins with mirth gayly frolick around,</br>To hear the sweet pipe, swell'd by gratitude's voice,</br>While each innocent bosom approves the glad sound.</br>No more, good Palemon, the prince of our plain,</br>Lies rack'd by disease, on the sad bed of pain.</br>"]
