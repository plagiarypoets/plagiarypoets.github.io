["Th' appointed Time is come;&mdash;</br>Punctual as Lovers to the promis'd Hour</br>At Midnight Assignation, all appear,</br>All Hearts elated, fill'd with golden Hopes,</br>And villainous Intent, to rob his Friend:</br>His Friend; no, Friendship's banish'd hence,</br>Nought but an empty Name.  Is he my Friend,</br>Whose avaricious Mind, basely exulting,</br>Would joyfully behold my Pockets stripp'd</br>T' enrich his own?  'Tis inconsistent.&mdash;", "Pleasure now sparkles in each eager Eye,</br>For see, the Card-Table appears.  Eager Impatience</br>Swells each Bosom; a Challenge strait is given,</br>And is as soon accepted.  Now Silence reigns;</br>Their loud-Mouths stopt, and busy Heads</br>Contriving how their Adversaries to beat,</br>And win the shining Pelf; except when Fortune frowns,</br>And fills the Gamester's Hand with losing Cards,</br>Then murmuring Oaths are heard, uplifted Eyes</br>Then Brows contract.  All's Anarchy within.</br>With envious Eye his joyful Foe he views,</br>To think his Cash reduc'd; but yet the pleasing Thought</br>That the next Game may chance it to return,</br>Becalms his ruffled Soul.  As on the boist'rous Main,</br>When roaring Billows mount the strong ribb'd Bark,</br>And toss her to and fro, then Fear possesses</br>Every Breast; anon the Winds abate,</br>Some wish'd-for Port appears; that Fear dispels,</br>And in its Stead produces pleasing Hope.</br>Hope urges him again to try his Fate,</br>Still Fortune frowns, till all his shining Ore,</br>So lovely to his Sight, (oh!  dire Reverse)</br>Is gone to enrich his Adversary's Store.</br>Then Thought intrudes, unpleasing Guest,</br>Dull, melancholy Thought!  Where's Friendship fled?</br>Will he who now possesses all thy Wealth</br>Refund thee any back?  No, not a Piece,</br>Ev'n if that Piece would save thee from Destruction;</br>But in Return give bitter biting Jests.  This th' Effects</br>Of Gaming; for where the Heart it enters</br>Peace is banish'd, and in its Room,</br>As Fear or Hope prevail, th' unruly Passions</br>Declare the troubled Mind.</br>"]
