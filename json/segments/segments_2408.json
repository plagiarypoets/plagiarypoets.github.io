["If ever I have scorn'd thy sacred pow'r,</br>And wrong'd thy nature gentle, kind, and sweet,</br>Or e'er refus'd the off'ring of a flow'r</br>To deck the sod of thine enshrin'd retreat,&mdash;</br>Oh, dearest Cupid!  suppliant at thy feet,</br>I now the crime implore thee to forgive;</br>And listen, while the vow I here repeat,</br>Thee to adore, long as thy name shall live,</br>Or thou one ardent vot'ry, gracious wilt receive!", "Thou art not cruel, false, capricious, wild;</br>Thy nature is indulgent, and benign:</br>While innocent and artless as a child,</br>Yet high matur'd intelligence is thine,</br>And on thy brow, truth and fair honour shine:</br>Benevolence and tenderness appear</br>In ev'ry smile that lights thy face divine;</br>And in thy sweet eye's floating lustrous tear,</br>Dwells a soft, sacred charm, to virtue fondly dear.", "Oh!  when my heart has left thy pure domain,</br>Incautious, unsuspecting, led to rove</br>O'er vanity, or folly's painted plain,</br>Or lur'd by murmurs soft, of flattery's grove,</br>E'en then, thou hast not left, forgiving Love,</br>Thy undeserving, and neglectful child;</br>But by each tender winning art, hast strove</br>To lure again the wanderer beguil'd,</br>And charm, and fix, by thine endearments mild.", "Oh, I am thine &mdash; for ever, ever thine!</br>On thee for ev'ry hope I now rely;</br>The fond enthusiast bends before the shrine,</br>And visions bright as clouds on ev'ning sky</br>Beholds entranc'd, with fix'd enchanted eye.</br>Oh, Love!  with thee for ever could I rest;</br>Far from the world, and its delusions fly;</br>And, like a bird within her downy nest,</br>Repose in shelter safe, my panting, wearied breast!</br>"]
