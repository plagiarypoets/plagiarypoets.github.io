["Give me, ye weeping Nine, the softest Airs,</br>Whilst I with you Philander's Fate condole;</br>Let Pity grace each sadly-pleasing Verse,</br>And tender Words that thrill the melting Soul:</br>Echo shall kindly answer as I mourn,</br>And gently-wafted Sounds my doleful Plaints return.", "When rural Spencer sung, the list'ning Swains</br>Would oft' forget to feed the fleecy Throng;</br>The fleecy Throng, charm'd with the melting Strains,</br>Fed not &mdash; but on the Musick of his Song;</br>His Mulla would in ling'ring Bubbles play,</br>'Till his pleas'd Waters stole unwillingly away.", "And cou'd my Verse but with its Theme compare,</br>Moving as Spencer I my Grief wou'd tell;</br>The ravish'd Bard shou'd to Elysium hear</br>A second Colin mourn a second Astrophel.</br>My Lays shou'd more than equal Glory boast,</br>And the fam'd Mulla be in smoother Cherwell lost.", "Cherwell!

 shall see no more.", "Look, said the Youth, (as then he wond'ring stood)</br>How Cherwell's Waves in dinted Dimples smile!</br>I joy to see his amicable Flood</br>With circling Arms embrace the happy Soil:</br>How loth he seems those charming Shades to leave,</br>That from his silver Urn a nobler Grace receive!&mdash;", "&mdash;But mute is now the Musick of that Voice,</br>That to th' attentive Flood such Praises gave!&mdash;</br>'Mong Bones and Skulls the dear Philander lies,</br>Cold, cold, and silent as the dismal Grave!&mdash;</br>Mourn then, ye Youths, for ever mourn his Fate;</br>Ye cannot grieve too long &mdash; but oh ye grieve too late!", "&mdash;Look all around the Woods, and Plains, and Floods;</br>Do not ev'n they the mighty Loss deplore?</br>Lo Pleasure leaves the Floods, and Plains, and Woods!</br>And pensive Birds now warble there no more;</br>But pining Doves, and moaning Turtles coo,</br>And Choirs of Swans make up the Harmony of Woe.", "Their tuneful Sorrow ravishes my Ear,</br>While mourning Vegetables please the Eye;</br>The sick'ning Flow'rs their Heads but faintly rear,</br>And droop beneath the dewy Tears, and die!</br>Like them the Youth a thousand Charms cou'd boast,</br>&mdash;But oh the Youth like them those short-liv'd Charms has lost!", "Say, You his Friends, Companions of my Woe,</br>Say what kind Gentleness adorn'd his Mind?</br>Tell me, can You such native Candour show?</br>And may we still a true Philander find?</br>Vain Hope!

 how ashy pale his Hue!</br>I ne'er unwilling saw the lovely Youth 'till now!", "Are those the Arms with which we oft embrac'd?</br>Those Hands, benumm'd, and cold, are those like his?</br>And his dear Lips, by constant Learning grac'd,</br>Say, did they tremble, and look wan as these?&mdash;</br>&mdash;Love might with Fear a doubtful Strife maintain,</br>But that my Griefs present a yet more dismal Scene.", "Behold!  his Friends all croud around his Bed!</br>Hark with what bitter Cries they o'er him moan!</br>Look on their streaming Eyes!  what Tears thy shed!</br>Their Grief makes all his Miseries their own!</br>And while this Pomp of Death Philander sees,</br>The dying Youth by their's perceives his Miseries.", "Now his chill Face with eager Lips they kiss,</br>Grasp his cold Hand, and take their last Farewell!&mdash;</br>How languishing they fix their Eyes on his!</br>Their aking Sight cou'd there for ever dwell!</br>Too well they know those parting Looks are vain,</br>And turn themselves aside &mdash; yet needs must look again.", "&mdash;But doubtful Mists swim hov'ring o'er his Eyes,</br>That feebly round their hollow Orbits rowl;</br>Whilst in imperfect Groans and less'ning Sighs,</br>With pious Carelessness he yields his Soul;</br>His Soul unfetter'd seeks the Realms of Light,</br>And to her native Heav'n she takes her tow'ring Flight.", "But who can tell his weeping Mother's Care?</br>His Death in vain by silent Friends is hid.</br>For conscious Tears the fatal Truth declare,</br>And their expressive Silence says, He's Dead!</br>Her still-born Sorrow speaks an inward Woe,</br>Beyond what Sighs, or Tears, or Words unequal show.", "O cease, thou good Sophronia, left forlorn,</br>For thy much-lov'd Philander weeps no more;</br>Those, who thy Son's sad Fate cou'd never mourn,</br>Will ev'n his living Mother now deplore;</br>For when such Piety in Tears they view,</br>Their soften'd Hearts must grieve to symphathize with You.", "Look on thy Daughter, beauteous in Distress,</br>Nor think while Stella lives Philander lost;</br>Oh!
