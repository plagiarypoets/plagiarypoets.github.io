["Hence, ye busy scenes of day!</br>Ye vain, corroding cares away!</br>Let no unhallow'd thoughts intrude</br>Upon this sacred solitude.</br>Lo!  sable darkness veils the scene:</br>No rude sounds now intervene,</br>To disturb this calm repose,</br>The trembling zephyr scarcely blows;</br>But all is silent, all is still,</br>Save the murm'ring of a rill</br>That softly trickles o'er the stone,</br>'Mid drowsy banks with moss o'ergrown;</br>Save the hoarse bark of watch-dog bold,</br>Trusty guardian of the fold;</br>Or the rare tinkling of a bell,</br>Faintly sounding thro' the dell;</br>Save the slowly-waving pine,</br>Or the distant low of kine.", "No more the shepherd's blithesome song</br>Is heard the lofty hills among,</br>No more his flocks his care employ,</br>He to the hamlet hastes with joy,</br>To woo the maid, her heart to move,</br>By vows of faith and endless love.</br>No more does Echo, from her seat</br>Among the craggy steeps, repeat</br>The hoary woodman's sturdy stroke,</br>Resounding from the aged oak;</br>Nor the huntsman's cheerful horn,</br>Companion of the rising morn,</br>The buxom infant now no more,</br>Gambols round the cottage-door;</br>Nor health and innocence are seen,</br>Disporting on the verdant green;</br>But all (save those who wake to weep)</br>Are sunk in sweet oblivious sleep.", "Hail!  ever sacred, solemn hour</br>Of silence sweet!  whose magic pow'r</br>Can lull the troubled mind to rest,</br>And free from care the anxious breast.</br>To thee the mourner pours his grief,</br>And in thy shades he finds relief;</br>And e'en yon pallid form, Despair,</br>That beats the wrinkled brow of care,</br>Whose haggard cheek, whose rolling eye,</br>The starting tear, the broken sigh,</br>Betray the anguish of his mind,</br>In thee (if aught) can solace find.</br>Thy kind return the ploughman hails,</br>Who, when the live-long daylight fails,</br>Betakes him to his humble cot,</br>Sequester'd in a lonely spot;</br>Receives with joy his humble fare,</br>A stranger both to want and care,</br>On his hard couch his limbs he throws,</br>And soon is lost in soft repose.", "What tho' unto the guilty mind,</br>Thou'rt fraught with woes of direst kind;</br>What tho' the murd'rer dreads thy shade,</br>That saw him plunge his cursed blade;</br>What tho' his startled eye espies</br>Pale spectres from their vaults arise,</br>And hideous ghosts, and furies foul,</br>And horrid forms that round him howl,</br>Appal'd he hears their threat'ning sounds,</br>And trembles when thy shew their wounds;</br>To me thou com'st with milder mien,</br>For I can view with look serene,</br>Thy sable veil spread o'er the plain,</br>And bid thee welcome without pain.", "Oft let me at the close of day,</br>Thro' vallies clad with flow'rets gay,</br>With rapture urge my devious way;</br>There to behold the setting sun,</br>When he his daily course has run,</br>The empire of the skies resign,</br>And on the western hills recline;</br>Then join the shepherds' merry dance,</br>Whose wholesome toils their joys enhance;</br>Where innocence and mirth unite</br>With modesty and calm delight;</br>Whence discord's banish'd with her train,</br>Where love and bliss alone do reign;&mdash;</br>Or listen to the milkmaid's song,</br>The while she hastes the vale along,</br>The shepherd shouting to his flock,</br>Re-echoed by the cavern'd rock;</br>Until the objects round me fade,</br>And all's conceal'd by night's dark shade.</br>At that still hour oft let me rove,</br>With loit'ring footsteps thro' the grove,</br>To see the moon with splendour rise,</br>And with her crescent light the skies;</br>Silv'ring o'er the lofty trees,</br>That wave in concert with the breeze;</br>Here listen to the nightingale,</br>And hear her tell the mournful tale;</br>Whose song the savage breast can move,</br>And melt the tender mind to love:</br>And see the fairies with their queen,</br>Dancing sprightly on the green,</br>Who frisk the merry hours away,</br>And banquet by the glow-worm's ray.</br>With magic ring, and mystic sound,</br>They frolic o'er th' enchanted ground.</br>When, lo!  the sullen clock strikes one!</br>The lights are out, the dance is done:</br>Each flies the deepest shades to gain,</br>Like fleeting shadows o'er the plain.", "And oft within some lonely cell,</br>Where solitude and silence dwell,</br>Far from bustle, mirth, and noise,</br>And all the heart-deluding joys;</br>By the taper's glimm'ring light,</br>I'll spend the pensive hours of night.</br>There studious, search th' instructive page,</br>Of some renown'd and friendly sage,</br>His learned maxims to explore;</br>And draw from wisdom's sacred store.", "But when night spreads her deepest shade,</br>In solemn silence all is laid;</br>When hurry and confusion cease,</br>And warring passions are at peace,</br>Then let my thoughts ascend on high,</br>Still nobler themes my thoughts employ.</br>And in my breast, supreme alone,</br>May contemplation fix her throne.</br>Then science waft her soaring light,</br>Those glorious systems to behold,</br>And all their hidden parts unfold,</br>That in confusion seem to roll,</br>Yet constitute th' harmonious whole.", "Free from superstitious dread,</br>The peaceful mansions of the dead</br>I'll visit oft:  there mark the fate,</br>That all attends both low and great:</br>Thus thro' the silent church-yard roam,</br>And pore on ev'ry hallowed tomb;</br>Thence many an useful moral glean,</br>From this low earth my thoughts to wean,</br>And raise them to a brighter sky,</br>Where all is happiness and joy.", "O Night!  if these thy blessings are,</br>To heighten joy, and soften care,</br>Celestial rapture to impart,</br>T' instruct the mind, and mend the heart;</br>I'll gladly hail thy sable sway,</br>Nor mourn the absence of the day.</br>"]
