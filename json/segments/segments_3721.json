["Since JOCKEY of late is so kind,</br>My poor panting heart is at rest.</br>Such peace and contentment I find,</br>No maiden's so happy and blest.</br>For sweetly my days pass away,</br>With joy I attend on my sheep;</br>And though they should happen to stray,</br>I'll never once offer to weep.", "Such bliss do I find from my swain,</br>For he is so bonny and gay;</br>And meets me each night on the plain,</br>And calls me the flower of MAY.</br>He took me last week to the fair,</br>And gave me a top-knot beside,</br>Then kiss'd me, and call'd me his care,</br>And vow'd that I should be his bride.", "Then tell me, ye maidens, I pray,</br>How can I my JOCKEY deny,</br>Who chearfully sings thro' the day,</br>And charms me whenever he's nigh.</br>On the banks of the soft flowing TWEED,</br>Whenever we happen to meet,</br>So pleasing he plays on his reed&mdash;</br>No shepherd like JOCKEY'S so sweet.</br>"]
