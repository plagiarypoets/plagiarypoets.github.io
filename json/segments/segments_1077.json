["When Britain on her sea-girt shore,</br>Her white-rob'd Druids erst address'd;</br>What Aid (she cry'd) shall I implore,</br>What best defense, by numbers press'd?</br>\"Tho' hostile nations round thee rise,</br>(The mystic Oracles reply'd)</br>And view thine isle with envious eyes,</br>Their threats defy, their rage deride,</br>Nor fear Invasions from your adverse Gauls:</br>Britain's best bulwarks are her WOODEN WALLS.", "\"Thine Oaks descending to the main,</br>With floating forts shall stem the tides,</br>Asserting Britain's wat'ry reign</br>Where'er her thundering Navy rides:</br>Nor less to peaceful arts inclin'd,</br>Where Commerce opens all her stores,</br>In social bands will league mankind,</br>And join the sea-divided shores:</br>Spread then thy sails where Naval Glory calls:</br>Britain's best bulwarks are her WOODEN WALLS.", "Hail, happy isle!  what tho' the vales</br>No vine-impurpled tribute yield,</br>Nor fann'd with odour-breathing gales,</br>Nor crops spontaneous glad the field:</br>Yet Liberty rewards the toil</br>Of Industry, to labour prone,</br>Who jocund ploughs the grateful soil,</br>And reaps the harvest she has sown.</br>While other realms tyrannic sway inthralls,</br>Britain's best bulwarks are her WOODEN WALLS.\"", "Thus spake the bearded Seers of yore,</br>In visions wrapt of Britain's fame</br>Ere yet Iberia felt her pow'r,</br>Or Gallia trembled at her name.</br>O!  that my muse inspir'd could sing</br>The praises to her Heroes due,</br>Would heaven-born genius imp her wing,</br>Pleas'd, she'd the glorious theme pursue!</br>Then should my verse record great GEORGE'S reign,</br>Who stretch'd from Pole to Pole his wide domain.</br>"]
