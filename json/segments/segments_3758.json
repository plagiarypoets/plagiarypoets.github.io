["Now ev'ning dim appears &mdash; that much lov'd hour</br>Of sweet tranquility and rural ease:</br>When far afield is heard,</br>The ploughman's simple song;", "And from the bean-field sings the lab'ring bee,</br>Warn'd homeward, by the coming shades of night,</br>And dews that gently fall</br>On ev'ry drooping flow'r.", "With Contemplation let me seek to dwell,</br>In wild romantic vale, or ruin dark,</br>Where the swift-circling bat</br>Hits in the twilight way.", "And oft in sheep-cote near, the pleasing sound</br>Of warning-bell is heard; as Philomel,</br>In Echo's mournful haunts,</br>Sings her sad tale of woe.", "Or if by musing mem'ry fondly led</br>To poor Matilda's turf of fading flowers,</br>Meet me in holy guise,</br>O, Maid!  rever'd by those", "Who love to shed affection's hallow'd tears,</br>Unmark'd at night, when through the fleecy clouds,</br>That veil her azure sphere,</br>The wan moon dimly shines.", "But when drear Winter saddens all the plain,</br>And by the cheerful fire, at close of day,</br>I hear the bleak winds mourn,</br>Around my reed-thatch'd hut;", "The Muse my lonely hours shall oft beguile;</br>And thou, sweet maid, the willing mind shalt store</br>With pity, meek content,</br>And friendship's sacred law.", "As night appears, big with the wintry storm,</br>Then shall the glimm'ring lamp, with cheer ray,</br>Beam o'er the neigh'bring plain,</br>Or mountain's lonely side:", "For oft poor travellers benighted stray,</br>Wide of the village path, at that dark hour,</br>When not a watch-dog barks,</br>No distant sheep-bell sounds.", "Or ling'ring onward, fear the chasm's depth,</br>Conceal'd by drifted snow; as the cold blast</br>Howls through the leafless thorn,</br>And windings of the steep.</br>"]
