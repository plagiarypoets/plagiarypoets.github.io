["On the green summit of a craggy dell,</br>Enrich'd with mouldering fragments of old time,</br>The hoary thorn, the harebell, violet prime,</br>Where, 'erst the magic dance and merry spell,</br>Of Love's true joys adown the elfin lawn,</br>Kept the wild sport by twilight and by dawn;", "Here roam'd, enrich'd by her fairy train,</br>The source of mental bliss, Dame Fancy hight,</br>The wide unbound of earth and air, and light,</br>Freely, she kenn'd by her all-piercing eye;</br>Delighting oft to teach her listening fays,</br>Of truth sublime, of wonder, aye, and praise!", "One dusky dawn, surrounded by her throng,</br>She chear'd their little hearts from rueful dread,</br>(For, truth doth always chear if rightly sped)</br>All swift of foot, a winding path along,</br>Tripp'd a soft Virgin, graceful, aye, and pure,</br>That, freed from earth, could Heav'n alone ensure!", "Blest be thy speed, kind Fancy said, and now</br>Forth from her fairy ring, she beam'd a smile,</br>To lead the Nymph, and every fear beguile;</br>A ray serene dwelt on her downcast brow;</br>Fancy beheld Theresa's modest grace,</br>And tears of joy did mingle their embrace.", "Ah, haste, spirit of etherial light,</br>Rise to the bliss no time can ever cloy,</br>Learn there to count thy suffering as thy joy,</br>And know, that in the triumph of thy flight,</br>'Tis Fancy leads thee by her brightest ray!&mdash;</br>She rose upon the Seraph's wing to endless day!", "And thou, who bad'st the World admire her name,</br>Whose ardour bursts all poignant from the soul,</br>Let no vain forms these energies controul,</br>Or dare repress they rapturous flight to fame:</br>Henceforth I guide thee to yon star-clad throne,</br>And call Theresa's virtues all thy own!</br>"]
