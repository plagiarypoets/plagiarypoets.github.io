["THE ARGUMENT.</br>Roget Here on Willy calls,</br>To sing out his Pastorals:</br>Warrants Fame shall grace his Rimes,</br>Spight of Envy and the Times;</br>And shewes how in care he uses</br>To take comfort from his Muses.", "ROGET.  WILLY.", "ROGET.</br>Prethee, Willy, tell me this,</br>What new accident there is,</br>That thou (once the blythest Lad)</br>Art become so wondrous sad?</br>And so carelesse of thy quill,</br>As if thou hadst lost thy skill?</br>Thou wert wont to charme thy Flockes,</br>And among these rudest rockes</br>Hast so cheer'd me with thy Song,</br>That I have forgot my wrong.</br>Something hath thee surely crost,</br>That thy old wont thou hast lost.</br>Tell me, Have I ought mis-said</br>That hath made thee ill a-paid</br>Hath some Churle done thee a spite?</br>Dost thou misse a Lambe to night?</br>Frownes thy fairest Shepheards Lasse?</br>Or how comes this ill to passe?</br>Is there any discontent</br>Worse than this my banishment?", "WILLY.</br>Why doth that so evil seeme</br>That thou nothing worse dost deeme?</br>Shepheard. there full many bee,</br>That will chang Contens with thee.</br>Those that choose their Walkes at will,</br>On the Valley or the Hill.</br>Or those Pleasures boast of can,</br>Groves or Fieldes may yeeld to man:</br>Never come to know the rest,</br>Wherewithall thy minde is blest.</br>Many a one that oft resorts</br>To make up the troope at sports,</br>And in company some while,</br>Happens to straine foorth a smile:</br>Feeles more want, more outward smart,</br>And more inward griefe of hart,</br>Then this place can bring to thee,</br>While thy minde remayneth free.</br>Thou condemn'st my want of mirth,</br>But what find'st thou in this earth,</br>Wherein ought may be beleev'd</br>Worth to make me joy'd, or grieved?</br>And yet feele I (nathelesse)</br>Part of both I must confeses,</br>Sometime I of mirth doe borrow,</br>Otherwhile as much of sorrow,</br>But my present state is such,</br>I am not Joy'd, nor grieve I much.", "ROGET.</br>Why hath WILLY then so long</br>Thus forborne his wonted Song?</br>Wherefore doth he now let fall</br>His well-tuned Pastorall,</br>And my ears that musicke barre,</br>Which I more long after farre,</br>Than the libertie I want,", "WILLY.</br>That were very much to grant,</br>But doth this hold alway lad,</br>Those that sing not must be sad?</br>Did'st thou ever that Bird heare</br>Sing well, that sings all the yeare?</br>Tom the Piper doth not play</br>Till he weares his Pipe away:</br>There's a time to slacke the string,</br>And a time to leave to sing.", "ROGET.</br>Yea, but no man now is still,</br>That can sing, or tune a quill.</br>Now to chant it, were but reason,</br>Song and Musicke are in season,</br>Now in this sweet jolly tide,</br>Is the earth in all her pride.</br>The faire Lady of the May</br>Trim'd up in her best array</br>Hath invited all the Swaines,</br>With the Lasses of the Plaines</br>To attend upon her sport</br>At the places of resort.</br>Corridon (with his bould Rout)</br>Hath already been about</br>For the elder Shepheards dole,</br>And fetch'd in the Summer-Pole:</br>Whilest the rest have built a Bower,</br>To defend them from a shower,</br>Siel'd so close with boughs all greene,</br>Tytan cannot pry betweene.</br>Now the Dayrie-Wenches dreame</br>Of their Strawberries and Creame:</br>And each doth her selfe advance</br>To be taken in to dance:</br>Every one that knowes to sing,</br>Fits him for his Carolling;</br>So doe those that hope for meede,</br>Either by the Pipe or Reede:</br>And though I am kept away,</br>I doe hear (this very day)</br>Many learned Groomes doe wend.</br>For the Garlands to contend.</br>Which a Nimph that hight Desart,</br>(Long a stranger in this part)</br>With her owne faire hand hath wrought</br>A rare worke (they say) past thought,</br>As appeareth by the name,</br>For she calles them Wreathes of fame.</br>She hath set in their due place</br>Ev'ry flower that may grace,</br>And among a thousand moe,</br>(Whereof some but serve for show)</br>She hath wove in Daphnes tree,</br>That they may not blasted bee.</br>Which with Time she edg'd about,</br>Least the worke should ravell out.</br>And that it might wither never,</br>Intermixt it with Live-ever.</br>These are to be shar'd among,</br>Those that do excell for song:</br>Or their passions can rehearse,</br>In the smooth'st and sweetest verse.</br>Then for those among the rest,</br>That can play and pipe the best,</br>There's a Kidling with the Damme,</br>A fat Weather, and a Lambe.</br>And for those that leapen farre,</br>Wrastle, Runne, and throw the Barre,</br>There's appoynted guerdons to:</br>He that best the first can doe,</br>Shall for his reward be payd</br>With a Sheepe-hooke, faire in-layd</br>With fine Bone, of a strange Beast</br>That men bring from out the West.</br>For the next, a Scrip of red,</br>Tassell'd with fine coloured Thred:</br>There's prepared for their need,</br>That in running make most speed,</br>Or the cunning Measures foote,</br>Cups of turned Maple-roote,</br>Whereupon the skilfull man</br>Hath ingrav'd the Loves of Pan:</br>And the last hath for his due,</br>A fine Napkin wrought with blew.</br>Then my Willy why art thou</br>Carelesse of thy merit now?</br>What dost thou here with a wight</br>That is shut up from delight,</br>In a solitary den,</br>As not fit to live with men?</br>Goe my Willy get thee gone,</br>Leave me in exile alone.</br>Hye thee to that merry throng,</br>And amaze them with thy Song,</br>Thou art young, yet such a Lay</br>Never grac'd the month of May,</br>As (if they provoke thy skill)</br>Thou canst fit unto thy Quill,</br>I with wonder heard thee sing,</br>At our last yeers Revelling.</br>Then I with the rest was free,</br>When unknowne I noted thee:</br>And perceiv'd the ruder Swaines,</br>Envy thy farre sweeter straines.</br>Yea, I saw the Lasses cling</br>Round about thee in a Ring:</br>As if each one jealous were</br>Any but her selfe should heare.</br>And I know they yet doe long</br>For the res'due of thy Song.</br>Haste thee then to sing it foorth,</br>Take the benefite of woorth.</br>And Desert will sure bequeath</br>Fames faire Garland for thy wreath.</br>Hye thee Willy, hye away.", "WILLY.</br>Roget, rather let me stay,</br>And be desolate with thee,</br>Than at those their Revels bee,</br>Nought such is my skill I wis,</br>As indeed thou deem'st it is.</br>But what ere it be, I must</br>Be content, and shall I trust.</br>For a Song I doe not passe</br>Mong'st my friends, but what (alas)</br>Should I have to doe with them</br>That my Musicke doe contemne?</br>Some there are, as well I wot,</br>That the same yet favour not:</br>Yet I cannot well avow</br>They my Carrols disallow:</br>But such malice I have spied,</br>Tis as much as if they did.", "ROGET.</br>Willy, what may those men bee,</br>Are so ill, to malice thee?", "WILLY.</br>Some are worthy-well esteem'd,</br>Some without worth are so deem'd.</br>Others of so base a spirit,</br>They have nor esteeme, nor merit.", "ROGET.</br>What's the wrong?", "WILLY.</br>A slight offence,</br>Wherewithall I can dispense;</br>But hereafter for their sake</br>To my selfe I'le musicke make.", "ROGET.</br>What, because some Clowne offends,</br>Wilt thou punish all thy friends?", "WILLY.</br>Honest Roget understand me,</br>Those that love me may command me.</br>But, thou know'st, I am but young,</br>And the Pastorall I sung,</br>Is by some suppos'd to be</br>(By a straine) too high for me:</br>So they kindely let me gaine</br>Not my labour for my paine.</br>Trust me, I doe wonder why</br>They should me my owne deny.</br>Though I'me yong, I scorne to flit</br>On the wings of borrowed wit.</br>I'le make my owne feathers reare me,</br>Whither others cannot beare mee.</br>Yet I'le keepe my skill in store,</br>Till I've seene some Winters more.", "ROGET.</br>But in earnest mean'st thou so?</br>Then thou art not wise, I trow.</br>Better shall advise thee Pan,</br>For thou dost not rightly than:</br>Thats the ready way to blot</br>All the credit thou hast got.</br>Rather in thy Ages prime,</br>Get another start of Time:</br>And make those that so fond bee,</br>(Spite of their own dulnesse) see</br>That the sacred Muses can</br>Make a child in yeares, a man.</br>It is knowne what thou canst doo,</br>For it is not long agoe,</br>When that Cuddy, Thou, and I,</br>Each the others skill to try,</br>At Saint Dunstanes charmed well,</br>(As some present there can tell)</br>Sang upon a sodaine Theame,</br>Sitting by the Crimson streame:</br>Where, if thou didst well or no,</br>Yet remaines the Song to show.</br>Much experience more I've had,</br>Of thy skill (thou happy Lad)</br>And would make the World to know it;</br>But that Time will further show it:</br>Envy makes their tongues now runne</br>More than doubt of what is done;</br>For that needs must be thy owne,</br>Or to be some other's knowne:</br>But how then wilt suit unto</br>What thou shalt hereafter do?</br>Or I wonder where is hee,</br>Would with that song part to thee:</br>Nay, were there so mad a Swaine,</br>Could such glory sell for gaine;</br>Phoebus would not have combin'd</br>That gift with so base a minde.</br>Never did the Nine impart</br>The sweet secrets of their art</br>Unto any that did scorne,</br>We should see their favours worne</br>Therefore unto those that say,</br>Where they pleased to sing a Lay,</br>They could doo't, and will not tho;</br>This I speake, for this I know:</br>None ere drunke the Thespian spring,</br>And knew how, but he did sing.</br>For that once infus'd in man</br>Makes him shew't, doe what he can.</br>Nay those that do only sip</br>Or but ev'n their fingers dip</br>In that sacred Fount, poore Elves,</br>Of that brood will show themselves.</br>Yea, in hope to get them fame,</br>They will speake though to their shame</br>Let those then at thee repine</br>That by their witts measure thine.</br>Needs those Songs must be thine owne,</br>And that one day will be knowne.</br>That same imputation to,</br>I my selfe doe undergoe:</br>But it will appeare ere long,</br>I'me abus'd, and thou hast wrong;</br>Who at twice ten hast sung more</br>Then some will doe at fourscore.</br>Cheere thee (honest Willy) then,</br>And begin thy Song agen.", "WILLY.</br>Faine I would, but I doe feare</br>When againe my Lines they heare,</br>If they yeeld they are my Rimes,</br>They will faine some other Crimes;</br>And 'tis no safe ventring by,</br>Where we see Detraction ly.</br>For doe what I can, I doubt</br>Shee will picke some quarrell out;</br>And I oft have heard defended,</br>Little sayd, and soone amended.", "ROGET.</br>See'st thou not in clearest dayes,</br>Oft thicke fogges could Heavens rayse?</br>And that vapours which doe breath</br>From the Earths grosse Wombe beneath,</br>Seeme not to us with blacke steames,</br>To pollute the Sunnes bright beames</br>And yet vanish into ayre,</br>Leaving it (unblemisht) faire?</br>So (my Willy) shall it bee</br>With Detractions breath and thee.</br>It shall never rise so hie,</br>As to staine thy Poesie.</br>As that Sunne doth oft exhale</br>Vapours from each rotten Vale;</br>Poesie so sometime draines,</br>Grosse conceits from muddy braines;</br>Mists of Envie, fogs of spight,</br>Twixt mens judgements and her light:</br>But so much her power may doo,</br>That she can dissolve them too.</br>If thy Verse do bravely tower,</br>As she makes wing, she gets power:</br>Yet the higher she doth sore,</br>Shee's affronted still the more:</br>Till she to the high'st hath past,</br>Then she restes with Fame at last.</br>Let nought therefore thee affright,</br>But make forward in thy flight:</br>For if I could match thy Rime.</br>To the very Starres I'de climb.</br>There begin againe, and flye,</br>Till I reach'd Aeternity.</br>But (alas) my Muse is slow:</br>For thy pace she flagges too low:</br>Yes, the more's her haplesse fate,</br>Her short wings were clipt of late.</br>And poore I, her fortune ruing,</br>Am my selfe put up a muing.</br>But if I my Cage can rid,</br>I'le flye where I never did.</br>And though for her sake I'me crost,</br>Though my best hopes I have lost,</br>And knew she would make my trouble</br>Ten times more than ten times double:</br>I would love and keepe her too</br>Spight of all the world could doe.</br>For though banisht from my flockes,</br>And, confin'd within these rockes,</br>Here I waste away the light</br>And consume the sullen Night,</br>She doth for my comfort stay,</br>And keepes many cares away.</br>Though I misse the flowry Fields,</br>With those sweets the Spring-tyde yeelds,</br>Though I may not see those Groves,</br>Where the Shepheards chaunt their Loves,</br>And the Lasses more excell,</br>Than the sweet-voyc'd Philomel,</br>Though of all those pleasures past,</br>Nothing now remaines at last,</br>But Remembrance (poore reliefe)</br>That more makes, than mends my griefe:</br>She's my minds companion still,</br>Maugre Envies evill will.</br>(Whence she should be driven to,</br>Wer't in mortals power to do.)</br>She doth tell me where to borrow</br>Comfort in the mid'st of sorrow;</br>Makes the desolatest place</br>To her presence be a grace;</br>And the blackest discontents</br>Be her fairest ornaments.</br>In my former dayes of bliss,</br>Her divine skill taught me this,</br>That from everything I saw</br>I could some invention draw:</br>And raise pleasure to her height,</br>Through the meanest objects sight.</br>By the murmure of a spring,</br>Or the least bough's rusteling.</br>By a daizie whose leaves spred,</br>Shut when Tytan goes to bed;</br>Or a shady bush or tree,</br>Shee could more infuse in mee,</br>Than all Natures beauties can</br>In some other wiser man.</br>By her helpe I also now,</br>Make this churlish place allow</br>Somethings that may sweeten gladnes</br>In the very gall of sadnes,</br>The dull loaneness, the blacke shade,</br>That these hanging vaults have made</br>The strange Musicke of the waves,</br>Beating on these hollow Caves,</br>This blacke Den which Rocks embosse</br>Over-growne with eldest Mosse.</br>The rude Portals that give light,</br>More to Terrour, then Delight.</br>This my Chamber of Neglect,</br>Wal'd about with Disrespect,</br>From all these, and this dull ayre,</br>A fit object for Despaire;</br>Shee hath taught me by her might,</br>To draw comfort and delight.</br>Therefore thou best earthly blisse,</br>I will cherish thee for this.</br>Poesie, thou sweetest content</br>That ere Heav'n to mortals lent:</br>Though they as a trifle leave thee,</br>Whose dull thoughts cannot conceive thee,</br>Though thou be to them a scorne,</br>That to nought but earth are borne,</br>Let my life no longer bee</br>Then I am in love with thee.</br>Though our wise ones call thee madnes,</br>Let me never taste of sadnes</br>If I love not thy mad'st fits,</br>Above all their greatest wits.</br>And though some too seeming holy,</br>Doe account thy raptures folly:</br>Thou dost teach me to contemne</br>What makes Knaves and Fooles of them.</br>Oh high power, that oft doth carry</br>Men above,", "WILLY.</br>Good Roget tarry</br>I do fear thou wilt be gone</br>Quite above my reach anon;</br>The kind flames of Poesie</br>Have now borne thy thoughts so high</br>That they up in Heaven bee,</br>And have quite forgotten mee.</br>Call thy selfe to minde againe,</br>Are these Raptures for a Swaine,</br>That attends on lowly Sheepe,</br>And with simple Heards doth keepe?", "ROGET.</br>Thankes my Willy; I had runne</br>Till that Time had lodg'd the Sunne,</br>If thou had'st not made me stay;</br>But thy pardon heere I pray.</br>Lov'd Apolo's sacred fire</br>Had rais'd up my spirits higher</br>Through the love of Poesy,</br>Then in deed they use to flye.</br>But as I sayd, I say still,</br>If that I had Willi's skill,</br>Envie nor Detractions tongue</br>Should ere make me leave my song:</br>But I'de sing it every day</br>Till they pin'd themselves away.</br>Be thou then advis'd in this,</br>Which both just and fitting is:</br>Finish what thou hast begun,</br>Or at least still forward runne.</br>Haile and Thunder ill hee'l beare</br>That a blast of winde doth feare:</br>And if words will thus afray thee,</br>Prethee how will deeds dismay thee?</br>Doe not thinke so rathe a song</br>Can passe through the vulgar throng,</br>And escape without a touch,</br>Or that they can hurt it much:</br>Frosts we see doe nip that thing</br>Which is forward's in the Spring:</br>Yet at last for all such lets</br>Somewhat of the rest it gets:</br>And I'me sure that so maist thou,</br>Therefore, my kinde Willy now,</br>Since thy folding time drawes on</br>And I see thou must be gon,</br>Thee I earnestly beseech</br>To remember this my speech</br>And some little counsell take,</br>For thy poore friend Rogets sake:</br>And I more of this will say,</br>If thou come next Holy-day.</br>"]
