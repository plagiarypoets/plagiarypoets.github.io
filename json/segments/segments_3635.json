["O, sweetest MELANCHOLY, Queen of Sighs,</br>Deign to admit me to thy pensive train,</br>Who oft' have listen'd to</br>Thy strangely-whisper'd strains!</br>Or thou, mild THOMSON, Nature's meekest child,</br>Lead thy young Vot'ry!  or, SHAKESPEARE divine,</br>First of Fancy's children,</br>From thy fine-phrenzied lore</br>Teach me to breathe some sadly-soften'd note,</br>Attun'd to Song of dolorous argument!</br>For gone is a sweet Nymph</br>To th' undiscover'd Bourne</br>From whence the youngest trav'ller ne'er return'd:&mdash;</br>Rude-handed Death, to crop so fair a Flow'r</br>Timeless &mdash; just in the Spring</br>Of Life begun to blow!", "So have I seen a Lilly fair:  to-day</br>Soft-smiling; to-morrow with rude embrace</br>Of ruffian mildew</br>Her dainty form distain'd!</br>And now no more thou'lt lead the festive dance,</br>Beguiling, wolf-ey'd Winter's dreary Night,</br>Where Youth tripp'd on with glee</br>And Beauty grac'd the scene.", "And never more that converse meek and mild&mdash;</br>That heav'n-born grace which ev'ry paint eludes,</br>Save the fine paint of Thought,</br>Shall cheer Man's various day!</br>But in thy lonely bed for ever sleep</br>Those comely merits, which, op'ning to bloom,</br>Had in their summer's day</br>Ripen'd to goodliest fruit!", "Then light, oh, Earth, lie on her Maiden Breast;</br>And ye whose fronts are bright with Fortune's gem</br>Or gay Ambition's plume&mdash;</br>Who crop Pleasure's bri'ry Rose,</br>Bestow the farewell tribute of a sigh.</br>But ye who framed in Nature's finest mould,</br>Who thrill at the soft touch</br>Of Pity &mdash; dove-eyed maid&mdash;</br>Pour an empassion'd tear.  O Life!  wondrous</br>Is thy fleet day-dream &mdash; What or whence are we?</br>We come we know not whence;</br>We go we know not where.</br>"]
