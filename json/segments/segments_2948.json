["Dear Sk**r!  thy conduct to repay</br>In words (alas, I fail in deed!)</br>I choose this melancholy day,</br>Fondly to frame the grateful meed;</br>Day of my birth!  a day to anguish long decreed.", "Should time some transient joys impart,</br>To thee my lengthening years I owe;</br>Sooth'd by thy kindness, by thy art</br>Still rising from the bed of woe!</br>This wreath, by virtue won, let friendship glad bestow.", "But O, my friend!  the prospect lours;</br>The tempest, usher'd with the morn,</br>Frowns darkly on life's coming hours;</br>No rays yon desart coast adorn,</br>Where all is heartless hope, and solitude forlorn!", "Avail'd it, then, thy skill to save</br>Me, ling'ring on the shadowy grave?</br>From death recall'd, but call'd to brave</br>Anew misfortune's whelming roar!</br>By thee the body lives, the mind no balms restore.", "Yet &mdash; if the Town deign now to hear</br>The simple music of my lyre;</br>If to a few my name be dear;</br>Or I to bolder hopes aspire;</br>Not from the voice of praise do thou, the cause!  retire.</br>"]
