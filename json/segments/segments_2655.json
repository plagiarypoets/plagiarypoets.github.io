["O blessed Pow'r, whose magic spell</br>The stern and rugged heart can bind;</br>O Thou, who only lov'st to dwell</br>Within the pure and spotless mind,</br>Leave, leave awhile thy native sky,</br>And list thy suppliant's song, celestial Harmony!", "O, let thy gentle voice appease</br>The passion's loud and stormy strife;</br>Or rouse in moments such as these</br>The slumb'ring soul again to life;</br>When the thick blood forgets to flow,</br>The heart but feebly plays, the pulse beats still and slow.", "Ah!  few who breathe this vital air,</br>But dread that wretched hour's return,</br>When fancied ills the bosom tear,</br>And life's faint embers dimly burn;</br>When Pity's tear has ceas'd to flow,</br>And dead the heart to all &mdash; alike to mirth or woe!", "Then, Music, wake thy chorded shell;</br>And gently on the list'ning ear,</br>O, let the soften'd cadence dwell&mdash;</br>&mdash;'Tis luxury to hear&mdash;</br>No more to gloomy thoughts a prey,</br>The troubled heart relents, and casts its cares away.", "And he, Misfortune's hapless child,</br>Within whose frantic bosom reign</br>Distracting fears, emotions wild,</br>The tumult of a dizzy train:</br>E'en he thy wond'rous pow'r can tell,</br>In passion's fiercest storm he knows, he feels it well.", "Yet not to soothe man's wretched race</br>Thy magic sounds alone were giv'n;</br>Those magic sounds obtain a place</br>Amid the purer joys of heav'n,</br>E'en pleasing in his mighty eye</br>Who form'd both heav'n and earth, whose self is harmony.", "O, breathe into the gloomy soul</br>So holy and so sweet a strain,</br>As may unseeming thoughts controul,</br>Restoring wonted peace again:</br>May ev'ry doubt and fear remove,</br>And almost grant on earth the bliss we hope above.</br>"]
