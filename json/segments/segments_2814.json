["O Liberty, that on the plain</br>Where gladder flows the mighty Seine,</br>Thy radiant form hast rear'd;</br>And, leaving to the stupid slave</br>The chains, which Gothic darkness gave,</br>In simple grandeur hast appear'd!", "By all, who in thy cause have bled,</br>Or struck thy vanquish'd foes with dread,</br>With shouts of triumph blest;</br>By that brave pair, whose godlike deed</br>From chains immortal Athens freed,</br>Their swords in myrtle garlands drest;", "By him, who, fir'd with patriot zeal,</br>Lifting on high the vengeful steel,</br>Bade guilty Caesar fall;</br>Which fearless Virtue shall commend,</br>Howe'er she rue the murd'rous friend,</br>Impell'd by her relentless call;", "By his great soul, disdaining life,</br>When hopeless in the sacred strife;</br>By Cato's willing stroke;</br>By Orange, curst Iberia's foe;</br>And injur'd Tell's indignant blow,</br>Which dark Oppression's sceptre broke;", "By Runnimede's thrice-hallow'd plain;</br>By worthless Stuart's short-liv'd reign,</br>Who fled o'erwhelm'd with shame;</br>By Sidney's blood, ignobly shed,</br>And awful arm the tyrant's dread;</br>By Hampden's everlasting name;", "By all the sacred ties, that bind</br>The freeborn children of mankind;</br>By all, that's great and good;</br>By trampled want's low-mutter'd moans,</br>The worn-out slave's unpitied groans,</br>And fields deep-drench'd with guiltless blood;", "By Virtue friendless and forlorn,</br>Mock'd by the pointing hand of scorn,</br>While Guilt and Falsehood rise;</br>By hate of superstition's pow'r,</br>Before whose eyes, that abject low'r,</br>The gen'rous soul of manhood dies;", "By ev'ry sorrow of the cell,</br>Where Pray'r and faded Penance dwell,</br>Its doubts and loose desires,</br>Its strong regrets, heart-aching rest,</br>The pale-cheek'd virgin's love-sick breast,</br>Far-reaching thoughts, and hopeless fires;", "By the dark dungeon's lone complaint,</br>Where, save his moan in echos faint,</br>The captive hears no sound;</br>By the slow torture's ghastly fears,</br>Its shrieks, its agonizing tears,</br>Its writhing limbs, and groans profound;", "By these, O Freedom, hear thy son,</br>And let those triumphs, nobly won,</br>Still grace thy new retreat;</br>And he, the sacrilegious foe,</br>Who 'gainst thee aims the lawless blow,</br>May he thy tenfold vengeance meet.", "But far, O far be from thy side</br>Fierce Anarchy, her dagger dy'd</br>In blood of guiltless friends;</br>And dark Proscription, fiend abhorr'd,</br>Whose savage unrelenting sword</br>O'er all, but chief the good, impends.", "Bid Cruelty and Horror cease,</br>And in thy train let smiling Peace,</br>And Order calm appear;</br>And Justice, Mercy's milder mate,</br>That o'er her suff'ring victim's fate,</br>Recoiling, sheds the pitying tear.</br>"]
