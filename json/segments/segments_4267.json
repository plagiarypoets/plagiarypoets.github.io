["Observe the Rose-Bud e'er it blows,</br>While the Dawn glimmers o'er the Sky!</br>Observe its silken Leaves unfold,</br>As fond of Day's majestic Eye!</br>At Noon, more bold, in fullest Bloom,</br>It spreads a Gale of Sweets around;</br>At Eve it mourns the setting Sun,</br>And sheds its Honours on the Ground.", "So Beauty's bashful Bud appears,</br>So blushes in the Eye of Praise:</br>So ripens in the Noon of Life,</br>And wither'd so in Age decays.</br>Time is the Canker-Worm of Youth,</br>It bites the Blossom as it grows,</br>It blasts the Flow'r that blooms at full,</br>And rudely sheds the falling Rose.", "See, Beauty, see!  how Love and Joy</br>On Youth's light Pinions haste away;</br>How swift the Moments glide along,</br>And Age advances with Delay!</br>Now, Beauty!  crop the Rose-Bud new,</br>And catch the Essence as it flies;</br>Let Pleasure revel in its Bloom,</br>Let Time possess it when it dies.</br>"]
