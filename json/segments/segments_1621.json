["How beautiful this night!  the balmiest sigh,</br>Which vernal zephyrs breathe in evening's ear,</br>Were discord to the speaking quietude</br>That wraps this moveless scene.  Heaven's ebon vault,</br>Studded with stars unutterably bright,</br>Through which the moon's unclouded grandeur rolls,</br>Seems like a canopy which love had spread</br>To curtain her sleeping world.  Yon gentle hills,</br>Robed in a garment of untrodden snow;</br>You darksome rocks, whence icicles depend,</br>So stainless that their white and glittering spires</br>Tinge not the moon's pure beam; yon castled steep.</br>Whose banner hangeth o'er the time-worn tower</br>So idly, that rapt fancy deemeth it</br>A metaphor of peace; &mdash; all form a scene</br>Where musing solitude might love to lift</br>Her soul above this sphere of earthliness;</br>Where silence undisturbed might watch alone,</br>So cold, so bright, so still.", "The orb of day,</br>In southern climes, o'er ocean's waveless field</br>Sinks sweetly smiling:  not the faintest breath</br>Steals o'er the unruffled deep; the clouds of eve</br>Reflect unmoved the lingering beam of day;</br>And vesper's image on the western main</br>Is beautifully still.  To-morrow comes:</br>Cloud upon cloud, in dark and deepening mass,</br>Roll o'er the blackened waters; the deep roar</br>Of distant thunder mutters awfully;</br>Tempest unfolds its pinion o'er the gloom</br>That shrouds the boiling surge; the pityless fiend,</br>With all his winds and lightnings, tracks his prey;</br>The torn deep yawns, &mdash; the vessel finds a grave</br>Beneath its jagged gulf.", "Ah!  whence yon glare</br>That fires the arch of heaven? &mdash; that dark red smoke</br>Blotting the silver moon?  The stars are quenched</br>In darkness, and the pure and spangling snow</br>Gleams faintly through the gloom that gathers round</br>Hark to that roar, whose swift and deaf'ning peals</br>In countless echoes through the mountains ring,</br>Startling pale midnight on her starry throne!</br>Now swells the intermingling din; the jar</br>Frequent and frightful of the bursting bomb;</br>The falling beam, the shriek, the groan, the shout,</br>The ceaseless clangor, and the rush of men</br>Inebriate with rage: &mdash; loud, and more loud</br>The discord grows; till pale death shuts the scene,</br>And o'er the conqueror and the conquered draws</br>His cold and bloody shroud. &mdash; Of all the men</br>Whom day's departing beam saw blooming there,</br>In proud and vigorous health; of all the hearts</br>That beat with anxious life at sun-set there;</br>How few survive, how few are beating now!</br>All is deep silence, like the fearful calm</br>That slumbers in the storm's portentous pause;</br>Save when the frantic wail of widowed love</br>Comes shuddering on the blast, or the faint moan</br>With which some soul bursts from the frame of clay</br>Wrapt round its struggling powers.", "The grey morn</br>Dawns on the mournful scene; the sulphurous smoke</br>Before the icy wind slow rolls away,</br>And the bright beams of frosty morning dance</br>Along the spangling snow.  There tracks of blood</br>Even to the forest's depth, and scattered arms,</br>And lifeless warriors, whose hard lineaments</br>Death's self could change not, mark the dreadful path</br>Of the outsallying victors:  far behind,</br>Black ashes note where their proud city stood.</br>Within yon forest is a gloomy glen&mdash;</br>Each tree which guards its darkness from the day,</br>Waves o'er a warrior's tomb.", "I see thee shrink,</br>Surpassing Spirit! &mdash; wert thou human else?</br>I see a shade of doubt and horror fleet</br>Across thy stainless features:  yet fear not;</br>This is no unconnected misery,</br>Nor stands uncaused, and irretrievable.</br>Man's evil nature, that apology</br>Which kings who rule, and cowards who crouch, set up</br>For their unnumbered crimes, sheds not the blood</br>Which desolates the discord-wasted land.</br>From kings, and priests, and statesmen, war arose,</br>Whose safety is man's deep unbettered woe,</br>Whose grandeur his debasement.  Let the axe</br>Strike at the root, the poison-tree will fall;</br>And where its venomed exhalations spread</br>Ruin, and death, and woe, where millions lay</br>Quenching the serpent's famine, and their bones</br>Bleaching unburied in the putrid blast,</br>A garden shall arise, in loveliness</br>Surpassing fabled Eden.", "Hath Nature's soul,</br>That formed this world so beautiful, that spread</br>Earth's lap with plenty, and life's smallest chord</br>Strung to unchanging unison, that gave</br>The happy birds their dwelling ill the grove,</br>That yielded to the wanderers of the deep</br>The lovely silence of the unfathomed main,</br>And filled the meanest worm that crawls in dust</br>With spirit, thought, and love; on Man alone,</br>Partial in causeless malice, wantonly</br>Heaped ruin, vice, and slavery; his soul</br>Blasted with withering curses; placed afar</br>The meteor-happiness, that shuns his grasp,</br>But serving on the frightful gulph to glare,</br>Rent wide beneath his footsteps?", "Nature! &mdash; no!</br>Kings, priests, and statesmen, blast the human flower</br>Even in its tender bud; their influence darts</br>Like subtle poison through the bloodless veins</br>Of desolate society.  The child,</br>Ere he can lisp his mother's sacred name,</br>Swells with the unnatural pride of crime, and lifts</br>His baby-sword even in a hero's mood.</br>This infant-arm becomes the bloodiest scourge</br>Of devastated earth; whilst specious names,</br>Learnt in soft childhood's unsuspecting hour,</br>Serve as the sophisms with which manhood dims</br>Bright reason's ray, and sanctifies the sword</br>Upraised to shed a brother's innocent blood.</br>Let priest-led slaves cease to proclaim that man</br>Inherits vice and misery, when force</br>And falshood hang even o'er the cradled babe,</br>Stifling with rudest grasp all natural good.", "Ah!  to the stranger-soul, when first it peeps</br>From its new tenement, and looks abroad</br>For happiness and sympathy, how stern</br>And desolate a tract is this wide world!</br>How withered all the buds of natural good!</br>No shade, no shelter from the sweeping storms</br>Of pityless power!  On its wretched frame,</br>Poisoned, perchance, by the disease and woe</br>Heaped on the wretched parent whence it sprung</br>By morals, law, and custom, the pure winds</br>Of heaven, that renovate the insect tribes,</br>May breathe not.  The untainting light of day</br>May visit not its longings.  It is bound</br>Ere it has life:  yea, all the chains are forged</br>Long ere its being:  all liberty and love</br>And peace is torn from its defencelessness</br>Cursed from its birth, even from its cradle doomed</br>To abjectness and bondage!", "Throughout this varied and eternal world</br>Soul is the only element, the block</br>That for uncounted ages has remained.</br>The moveless pillar of a mountain's weight</br>Is active living spirit.  Every grain</br>Is sentient both in unity and part,</br>And the minutest atom comprehends</br>A world of loves and hatreds; these beget</br>Evil and good:  hence truth and falsehood spring;</br>Hence will and thought and action, all the germs</br>Of pain or pleasure, sympathy or hate,</br>That variegate the eternal universe.</br>Soul is not more polluted than the beams</br>Of heaven's pure orb, ere round their rapid lines</br>The taint of earth-born atmospheres arise.", "Man is of soul and body, formed for deeds</br>Of high resolve, on fancy's boldest wing</br>To soar unwearied, fearlessly to turn</br>The keenest pangs to peacefulness, and taste</br>The joys which mingled sense and spirit yield.</br>Or he is formed for abjectness and woe,</br>To grovel on the dunghill of his fears,</br>To shrink at every sound, to quench the flame</br>Of natural love in sensualism, to know</br>That hour as blest when on his worthless days</br>The frozen hand of death shall set its seal,</br>Yet fear the cure, though hating the disease.</br>The one is man that shall hereafter be;</br>The other, man as vice has made him now.", "War is the statesman's game, the priest's delight,</br>The lawyer's jest, the hired assassin's trade,</br>And, to those royal murderers, whose mean throne;</br>Are bought by crimes of treachery and gore,</br>The bread they eat, the staff on which they lean.</br>Guards, garbed in blood-red livery, surround</br>Their palaces, participate the crimes</br>That force defends, and from a nation's rage</br>Secures the Crown, which all the curses reach</br>That famine, frenzy, woe and penury breathe.</br>These are the hired bravos who defend</br>The tyrant's throne &mdash; the bullies of his fear:</br>These are the sinks and channels of worst vice,</br>The refuse of society, the dregs</br>Of all that is most vile:  their cold hearts blend</br>Deceit with sternness, ignorance with pride,</br>All that is mean and villainous, with rage</br>Which hopelessness of good, and self-contempt,</br>Alone might kindle; they are decked in wealth.</br>Honour and power, then are sent abroad</br>To do their work.  The pestilence that stalks</br>In gloomy triumph through some eastern land</br>Is less destroying.  They cajole with gold,</br>And promises of fame, the thoughtless youth</br>Already crushed with servitude:  he knows</br>His wretchedness too late, and cherishes</br>Repentance for his ruin, when his doom</br>Is sealed in gold and blood!", "Those too the tyrant serve, who, skilled to snare</br>The feet of justice in the toils of law,</br>Stand, ready to oppress the weaker still;</br>And, right or wrong, will vindicate for gold,</br>Sneering at public virtue, which beneath</br>Their pityless tread lies torn and trampled, where</br>Honour sits smiling at the sale of truth.", "Then grave and hoary-headed hypocrites,</br>Without a hope, a passion, or a love,</br>Who, through a life of luxury and lies,</br>Have crept by flattery to the seats of power,</br>Support the system whence their honours flow. . . .</br>They have three words: &mdash; well tyrants know their use,</br>Well pay them for the loan, with usury</br>Torn from a bleeding world! &mdash; God, Hell, and Heaven.</br>A vengeful, pityless, and almighty fiend,</br>Whose mercy is a nick-name for the rage</br>Of tameless tygers hungering for blood.</br>Hell, a red gulf of everlasting fire,</br>Where poisonous and undying worms prolong</br>Eternal misery to those hapless slaves</br>Whose life has been a penance for its crimes.</br>And Heaven, a meed for those who dare belie</br>Their human nature, quake, believe, and cringe</br>Before the mockeries of earthly power.", "These tools the tyrant tempers to his work,</br>Wields in his wrath, and as he wills destroys,</br>Omnipotent in wickedness:  the while</br>Youth springs, age moulders, manhood tamely does</br>His bidding, bribed by short-lived joys to lend</br>Force to the weakness of his trembling arm.", "They rise, they fall; one generation comes</br>Yielding its harvest to destruction's scythe.</br>It fades, another blossoms:  yet behold!</br>Red glows the tyrant's stamp-mark on its bloom,</br>Withering and cankering deep its passive prime.</br>He has invented lying words and modes,</br>Empty and vain as his own coreless heart;</br>Evasive meanings, nothings of much sound,</br>To lure the heedless victim to the toils</br>Spread round the valley of its paradise.", "Look to thyself, priest, conqueror, or prince!</br>Whether thy trade is falsehood, and thy lusts</br>Deep wallow in the earnings of the poor,</br>With whom thy master was: &mdash; or thou delightst</br>In numbering o'er the myriads of thy slain,</br>All misery weighing nothing in the scale</br>Against thy short-lived fame:  or thou dost load</br>With cowardice and crime the groaning land,</br>A pomp-fed king.  Look to thy wretched self!</br>Aye, art thou not the veriest slave that e'er</br>Crawled on the loathing earth?  Are not thy days</br>Days of unsafisfying listlessness?</br>Dost thou not cry, ere night's long rack is o'er,</br>When will the morning come?

When the grave</br>Has swallowed up thy memory and thyself,</br>Dost thou desire the bane that poisons earth</br>To twine its roots around thy coffined clay,</br>Spring from thy bones and blossom on thy tomb,</br>That of its fruit thy babes may eat and die?", ""]
