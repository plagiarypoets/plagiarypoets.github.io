["O thou, my lov'd, my latest choice,</br>To whom my riper vows are paid!</br>Though, thoughtless of my heavenly voice,</br>I first the plaintive strain essay'd;</br>Be thou, O Fame, my sweetest, best reward,</br>And crown with deathless bays thy raptur'd bard!", "Awhile, by Sappho's numbers fir'd,</br>I touch'd the languid Lesbian string;</br>But now by thee arous'd, inspir'd,</br>Of noble themes I burn to sing:</br>Of godlike Britain's liberty and laws,</br>And heroes bleeding in her beauteous cause.", "So wanders wild the generous steed,</br>In wanton youth, of ease possess'd,</br>Serene he crops the flowery mead;</br>No thought of glory fires his breast:</br>But when he hears the trumpet's sound from far,</br>His soul dilates; and, swelling, pants for war.", "O beauteous Liberty!  for thee</br>The Rhine's unhappy exiles roam;</br>Forc'd by a tyrant's hard decree,</br>To quit their dear paternal home:</br>By thee Helvetia's barren mountains smile,</br>Nor envy fair Campania's fruitful soil.", "Nor be my weaker sex denied</br>To breathe the glorious patriot strain:</br>Since we can boast, with pleasing pride,</br>The Virgin Queen's triumphant reign;</br>When Tyranny forsook th' enfranchis'd land,</br>And freedom rose beneath a female hand.", "With freedom rose her genuine train;</br>The Statesman wise, the letter'd Sage,</br>The laurell'd Bard, the chieftain plain;</br>And own'd a new Augustan age:</br>Around the great Eliza's dreaded throne,</br>Victorious Essex, Drake, and Raleigh, shone.", "Then blameless Walsingham arose,</br>At once his queen's and country's friend;</br>Skill'd to discern their lurking foes,</br>And from the secret dart defend:</br>And deathless Bacon's comprehensive soul</br>Of boundless science grasp'd th' amazing whole.", "But, see!  to guide the golden reins</br>Of empire, mighty Burleigh rise!</br>He pours forth plenty o'er the plains;</br>Calm, steady, uncorrupted, wise:</br>O sacred shade, accept the grateful lay</br>Each British voice must to thy virtues pay.", "Then, too, the favour'd Muses smil'd;</br>And, sporting on the banks of Thame,</br>Strong-fancied Spenser, Shakespeare wild,</br>And Sydney, hail'd Eliza's name:</br>Then manly Johnson's justly-pictur'd page,</br>And humorous Fletcher's, shook the laughing stage.", "O might those glorious days return!</br>Would statesmen, fir'd by Burleigh's name,</br>With ancient British ardour burn,</br>Scorn selfish views, and pant for fame!</br>Again our conqu'ring arms should Gallia weep,</br>And Albion reign triumphant o'er the deep.", "Prophetic, lo!  my raptur'd mind</br>Beholds, as rolling minutes move,</br>A patriot-monarch, who shall find</br>His safety in his people's love:</br>Unbrib'd, around his grateful subjects stand,</br>While base Corruption, blushing, leaves the land!", "Then o'er Britannia's beauteous isle</br>Shall peace and arts together rise;</br>Encourag'd by the Royal smile,</br>Shall future Homer's reach the skies:</br>Each modest muse shall raise her drooping head,</br>Nor pine, neglected, in the barren shade.", "But whither, fir'd, would Fancy rove;</br>And, soaring, dare the lofty theme!</br>Me best beseems, amid the grove,</br>To paint the mead, or murmuring stream;</br>There let me warble still my artless lays,</br>Too blest in beauteous Cecil's generous praise.</br>"]
