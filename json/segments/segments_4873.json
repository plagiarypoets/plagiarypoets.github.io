["Oh!  listen ye nymphs of the pure limpid rill</br>That murmurs delightful the meadows along:</br>Ye lambs cease your bleating, come list to my theme;</br>Ye sweet plaintive warblers, come join in my song.", "Oh!  where is young Damon?  each shepherd is heard,</br>With a tear and a sigh from his heart to exclaim,</br>\"Ah!  why did he leave us to wander afar?</br>Ah!  why did he leave us, for riches or fame?\"", "While Hudson's smoothe waters glide gently along,</br>Perhaps on the ocean young Damon is tost;</br>Or, perhaps, while fair Magadalen dreams his return,</br>Her shepherd 'mid tempest's dread fury is lost.", "Ah!  see her!  all pensive she moves o'er the green;</br>Her hair is dishevell'd, her cheeks are grown pale;</br>Kind hope feeds her eye, cruel doubt bids it swim.</br>Alas, she's no longer the pride of the vale.", "She heeds not her flocks, they have wandered astray,</br>She heeds not the stranger that passes her by;</br>The damsels all pity her sorrowful case,</br>While thus she is heard to complain with a sigh:", "\"Oh, Damon, my love, wilt thou never return!</br>Ah!  why didst thou leave me neglected, forlorn?</br>My only relief are the streams from my heart!</br>Oh, surely, 'twere better I'd never been born.", "\"How pure was the tear that bedimm'd his fond eye,</br>How sweet was the kiss which at parting he gave;</br>His look I'll remember, as long as I live,</br>And his kisses, unsullied, I'll bear to my grave.", "\"Alas!  he now dreams of the pangs I endure,</br>Unless he has chang'd his dear heart for a stone;</br>Oh!  yes; he may easily judge of my woe,</br>By comparing the state of my heart with his own.", "\"This moment perhaps he is weeping for me,</br>And pouring his heart rending grief in the brine;</br>But, Damon!  fond love bids me fly to the wave,</br>Where, perchance, these sad tear-drops may mingle with thine.\"</br>"]
