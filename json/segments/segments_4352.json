["How happy was Corydon's lot,</br>How envy'd by every swain!</br>When Philis enliven'd his cot,</br>And listen'd all kind to his strain!", "How sweetly the hours stole away,</br>While love did the moments beguile!</br>How light were the cares of the day,</br>Rewarded by Philida's smile!", "How bless'd in the morn have I been,</br>When Phoebus just peep'd o'er the hill!</br>To see her advance o'er the green,</br>And stop at the murmuring rill.", "With raptures I've hasted to meet,</br>And handed across the dear maid:</br>Then led her to some pleasant seat,</br>Where woodbines and jessamines shade.", "The lambkins all careless at play,</br>The skies and all nature serene:</br>The lark, lovely herald of day,</br>Enliven'd and welcom'd the scene.", "Remote from the sun-beams at noon,</br>On some mossy bank in the vale;</br>How oft did we pastorals tune?</br>While echo repeated the tale.", "Near the brook, at the close of the day,</br>How grateful was Philomel's strain!</br>Alone on the next hawthorn spray,</br>How sweet did the blackbirds complain!", "How sweet were the eglantine bow'rs,</br>How sweet were the shades of the grove!</br>How sweet to reflect on the hours,</br>When Phillis requited my love!", "But, alas, now how sadden'd the view,</br>How dreary the once pleasant plain!</br>My sheep and my lambkins adieu,</br>For Phillis has slighted her swain.</br>"]
