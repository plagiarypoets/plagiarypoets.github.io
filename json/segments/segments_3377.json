["Hail, C**, hail!  nor may the mournful voice</br>Of unknown song displease thee:  rather lend</br>To poor LORENZO'S strains</br>A willing, listening ear;</br>Yes, sober matron!  fain would he recount</br>In part the comforts which thy town affords;</br>And to thy daughters fair</br>Address the grateful lay;</br>For fair thy daughters are, and kind as fair,</br>And wise as kind, and generous as wise,</br>And sweet as generous, and good</br>And innocent as sweet.</br>Oft have they wing'd with bliss LORENZO'S hours,</br>When sad reflection else had whelm'd his thoughts,</br>And sorrow's sharpest fangs</br>Were fastening on his soul!</br>Yet, though the gentle converse of the fair</br>Prov'd thus consolatory, wanton fires</br>Ne'er flutter'd in his breast</br>But friendship's hallow'd warmth</br>Matur'd to chastest love inspir'd each thought.</br>When he was wont to muse upon his fate</br>He sigh'd; &mdash; to find that hope</br>Held forth no cheering ray</br>By which he might ascend to HYMEN'S fane;</br>Unless, in human thought!  his recreant mind</br>Consented to involve</br>A partner in his woes!</br>"]
