Marlbro' plac'd before these Eyes,</br>How can thy Soldier's Spirit chuse but rise?</br>If, farther much, this Foreign Pride pretends,</br>And makes us Foes, it courted to be friends;</br>Might I, once more, be bid in Arms to shine,</br>I'd share his Glories, make your Poems mine:</br>Still Britain should be dreaded and ador'd,</br>As your Pen rais'd the Lustre of my Sword.", "Such should I guess your Thought, because no more</br>Than but to do, what you have done before.</br>Come to Spain's Coasts, when last you cross'd the Main,</br>You saw, conquer'd, &mdash; for you humbled Spain,</br>See, what I say of Poet's Pow'rs, how true!</br>And what by warming Heroes they can do!</br>For, lo!  Since Congreve did this Poem write,</br>They grow deliberate, too cool for Fight!</br>They've learnt brave Britons loudest Threats declare</br>Both of a Naval and a Landing War;</br>Ev'n now they think they hear our Lion roar,</br>Frighten their Golden Fleece, and shake their Shoar;</br>Then recollect our Chiefs that bore Command,</br>Names carrying Terror thro' their conquer'd Land:</br>But then, Thee nam'd! &mdash; late Thunder-claps they hear</br>Wishful cry Truce &mdash; and condescend to fear.</br>Hence, should they e'er from such wise Measure cease,</br>And wildly War prefer to proffer'd Peace:</br>I, if I liv'd to see so strange a Time,</br>Would strive to shine in Prose, that can't in Rhime.</br>From Tully (Bard like me!)  would try to draw</br>A Piece like his, on the Manilean Law;</br>Would shew that Spain should humbled be by you,</br>As he prov'd Pompey best would Pontus' King subdue.</br>So like each Theme, it my Success secures;</br>Change but the Name, and Pompey's Praise is yours.</br>Thus, free to use great Tully's Words divine,</br>I, just apply'd, might justly make them mine.</br>I'd shew such Prowess, Influence, and Success,</br>Our Briton's Arms, must, as his Roman's, bless.</br>Shew how you, Cobham, in the Art of War,</br>Your Skill with his Great Pompey can compare;</br>That, like him, formidable grown by Fame,</br>You carry Conquest in your very Name.", "But Congreve gone, what Bard in equal Lays,</br>Of such fresh Battles should form proper Praise?</br>Yourself, best Critic of his Verse and Prose,</br>Who, but Yourself, would best such Works compose?</br>Doubly, like Caesar, Act; first gain each Fight,</br>Then, what you greatly Gain, as wisely Write.", "Your Talent recollecting, I rejoice,</br>I chose, to end my Letter, Congreve's Voice.</br>For Phoebus whispers; \"Thy Epistle's long,</br>Be wise, and crown it with my Laureat's Song;</br>So shall thy humble Ivy creep around</br>Their Lawrels, which triumphant Temples bound,</br>Cobham's and Congreve's &mdash; that's enough &mdash; now cease</br>Learn this hard Lesson, when to hold thy peace.</br>Many, whose Genius led them to excel,</br>Lost Fame, not leaving off, when all was well.\"</br>"]
