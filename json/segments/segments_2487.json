["Nature, thy genial call I hear,</br>Which wakes the Morn and me,</br>And seems to strike upon my ear,</br>Though deaf to all but Thee:</br>To me the hours in silence roll away;</br>No Music greets the dawn, or mourns the close of day.", "To me, the Sky-larks pois'd aloft,</br>In silence seem to play;</br>And hail no more in warblings soft</br>The rising dawn of day;</br>For me in vain they swell their liquid throats,</br>Contemplative I muse, nor heed their jocund notes.", "To me the Shepherd pipes in vain,</br>In vain the Milk-maid sings;</br>Lost are the bleatings of the plain,</br>The gurgling of the springs:</br>No more I hear the Nightingale complain,</br>When to the moon she chaunts her sad love-labour'd strain.", "And when with me Lucinda strays</br>Along the breezy grove,</br>In transports on her charms I gaze,</br>And think she talks of love:</br>Ah, cease, dear Maid, to talk of love in vain;</br>Thy smiles alone to me the voice of Love explain.", "Pygmalian thus, when he survey'd</br>The work his hand has form'd,</br>Enamour'd, wish'd to see the Maid</br>With mutual passion warm'd;</br>And as he woo'd, his ear he oft inclin'd,</br>Whilst yet no voice of Love reliev'd his anxious mind.", "Whence these complaints?  Methinks e'en now</br>The voice of Reason cries,</br>Dispel the gloom that clouds thy brow,</br>Suppress thy heaving sighs:</br>What Fate decrees 'tis folly to bewail,</br>Weigh then the Good and Ill in Wisdom's equal scale.", "No more in Friendship's thin disguise</br>Shall Flatt'ry sooth thine ear;</br>Experienc'd kindness makes thee wise</br>To know thy friend sincere:</br>No more shalt thou attend to Faction's cries,</br>The taunts of jealous Pride, or Envy's blasting lies.", "No more shall now thy mind be tost</br>By every breath of Praise;</br>No more thy Reason shall be lost</br>In Controversy's maze:</br>Thou safe, thro' Life's sequester'd vale shalt go,</br>And learn from Nature's works her wise decrees to know.</br>"]
