["Unhappy daughter of distress and woe,</br>Whate'er thy sorrows, and whoe'er thou art,</br>For thee the tear of charity shall flow,</br>Warm from the purest fountain of the heart.", "Perhaps, though now neglected and forlorn,</br>A Parent once beheld thee with delight;</br>The idol of a father's heart alone,</br>Or the lov'd darling of a mother's sight.", "For thee, perhaps, they toil'd, and watch'd, and pray'd,</br>O'er thy sweet innocence with rapture hung;</br>And well they thought their tend'rest care repaid,</br>To hear the artless music of thy tongue.", "When dawning reason shed her ray divine,</br>And all thy excellence became reveal'd,</br>How did they see thy op'ning virtue shine!</br>And hear thy praise, with transport ill conceal'd!", "For who, alas!  can tell thy secret worth?</br>What soft angelic goodness might appear?</br>The bosom laid defenceless on the earth,</br>Might once be grateful, gen'rous, and sincere!", "The tongue, that knew no friend to bid farewel,</br>Might once the noblest sentiments express!</br>The wretched head, that unsupported fell,</br>Might once be turn'd to stories of distress!", "Some base deceiver, practis'd to betray,</br>Might win thy easy faith, destroy thy fame;</br>Then throw thee, \"like a loathsome weed, away,\"</br>The sport of Fortune, and the child of Shame!", "Poor wanderer!  perhaps thou could'st not find</br>One gen'rous hand the slender gift to spare!</br>Insatiate Avarice the soul confin'd,</br>Or timid Prudence disbeliev'd thy pray'r.", "Whate'er thy lot hath been, unhappy shade!</br>From sin, at last, and sorrow, thou art free:</br>Thy debt to Virtue it is amply paid;</br>And weeping Pity pays her debt to thee.</br>"]
