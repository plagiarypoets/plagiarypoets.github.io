["Serene is the morning, the lark leaves his nest,</br>And sings a salute to the dawn.</br>The sun with his splendor embroiders the East,</br>And brightens the dew on the lawn,</br>While the sons of debauch to indulgence give way,</br>And slumber the prime of their hours,</br>Let us, my dear Stella!  the garden survey,</br>And make our remarks on the flow'rs.", "The gay gaudy tulip observe as you walk,</br>How flaunting the gloss of its vest!</br>How proud!  and how stately it stands on its stalk,</br>In beauty's diversity drest!</br>From the rose, the carnation, the pink and the clove,</br>What odours incessantly spring!</br>The South wafts a richer perfume to the grove,</br>As he brushes the leaves with his wing.", "Apart from the rest, in her purple array,</br>The violet humbly retreats;</br>In modest concealment she peeps on the day,</br>Yet none can excel her in sweets:</br>So humble, that (though with unparallel'd grace</br>She might e'en a palace adorn)</br>She oft in the hedge hides her innocent face,</br>And grows at the foot of the thorn.", "So Beauty, my fair-one!  is doubly refin'd,</br>When Modesty heightens her charms,</br>When Meekness, like thine, adds a gem to her mind,</br>We long to be lock'd in her arms.</br>Tho' Venus herself from her throne should descend,</br>And the Graces await at her call;</br>To thee the gay world would with preference bend,</br>And hail thee the Vi'let of all.</br>"]
