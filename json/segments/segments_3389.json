["Mark'd ye (as the Northern blast</br>In hollow murmurs o'er yon mountain past)</br>A Fiend direct the storm;</br>'Twas Horror: &mdash; on a dusky cloud he sat,</br>His eye-brow stern as Fate,</br>Cast browner darkness o'er his faded form.", "Where dwell'st thou, Horror &mdash; wrapt in midnight gloom,</br>Whilst whistling winds sound hollow to the ear;</br>Fix'st thou thine empire on the troubl'd air,</br>Or broodest o'er the trophy'd portals of a tomb?", "Oft have I mark'd thee in each vary'd scene,</br>Whilst blue-ey'd Fancy (heav'nly queen)</br>Has lent her strength'ning aid;</br>Still sought in vain that dark retreat,</br>Where motley stride thy pacing feet;</br>Where hies thy ghastly form.", "I've marked thee sitting o'er a murder'd corse</br>Amidst the warlike slain;</br>Paler was then thy wrinkl'd cheek</br>Than those stiff, murder'd limbs extended on the plain.", "I've mark'd thee swifter than the whirlwind's flight</br>Borne through the shades of night,</br>Whilst Cynthia, peeping from a cloudy veil,</br>Cast only one dim shadow o'er thy visage pale.</br>Hail then, thou phantom!  henceforth I'll adore</br>Thy magic influence, though I dread thy power.</br>"]
