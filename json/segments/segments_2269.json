["MORN.</br>Lo!  Morning wakes upon the gray hill's brow,</br>Raising the veil of mist, meek twilight wore;&mdash;</br>And hark!  resounding from the tamarind bough</br>The Minah's matins ring!  On Ganga's shore</br>The fervent Hindoos welcome and adore</br>The rising Lord of Day.  Above the vale</br>Behold the tall Palmyra proudly soar,</br>And wave his verdant crown, &mdash; a lustre pale</br>Gleams on the broad fringed leaves, that rustle in the gale!", "NOON.</br>How still the noon-tide hour!  no sounds arise</br>To cheer the sultry calm, &mdash; deep silence reigns</br>Among the drooping groves; the fervid skies</br>Glare on the slumbering wave; on those far plains</br>The zephyr dies, &mdash; no hope of rest detains</br>The pilgrim there!  Yon Orb's meridian might</br>No fragrant bower, no humid cloud restrains,&mdash;</br>The solar rays, insufferably bright,</br>Play on the fevered brow, and mock the dazzled sight!", "NIGHT.</br>Oh!  how the spirit joys, when the fresh breeze,</br>The milder radiance, and the longer shade,</br>Steal o'er the sultry scene!  Through waving trees</br>The pale moon smiles, the minstrels of the glade</br>Hail night's fair Queen; and as the day-beams fade</br>Along the crimson west, through twilight gloom</br>The fire-fly darts; and, where all lowly laid</br>The dead repose, the mourner's hands illume</br>The consecrated lamp o'er beauty's hallowed tomb!</br>"]
