["As oft, reclin'd on Cherwell's shelving shore,</br>I trac'd romantic Spenser's moral page;</br>And sooth'd my sorrows with the dulcet lore</br>Which Fancy fabled in her elfin age:", "Much would I grieve, that envious Time so soon</br>O'er the lov'd strain had cast his dim disguise;</br>As lowering clouds, in April's brightest noon,</br>Mar the pure splendors of the purple skies.", "Sage Upton came, from every wonderous tale</br>To clear the mists that hung o'er fairy ground:</br>His wisard hand unlocks each magic vale,</br>And opes each flowery forest's guarded bound.", "Thus, never knight with mortal arms essay'd</br>The castle of proud Busyrane to quell,</br>Till Britomart her beamy shield display'd,</br>And broke with golden spear the mighty spell:", "The dauntless maid with hardy step explor'd</br>Each room, array'd in glistering imagery;</br>And through th' inchanted chamber, richly stor'd,</br>Saw Cupid's stately maske come sweeping by.", "At this, where'er, in distant region sheen,</br>She roves, embower'd with many a spangled bough,</br>Mild Una, lifting her majestic mien,</br>Braids with a brighter wreath her radiant brow.", "At this, in hopeless sorrow drooping long,</br>Her painted wings Imagination plumes;</br>Pleas'd that her laureate votary's rescued song</br>Its native charm and genuine grace resumes.</br>"]
