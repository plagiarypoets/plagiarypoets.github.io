["Nought is there, under Heaven's wide hollowness,</br>That moves more dear compassion of mind,</br>Than Beauty brought to' unworthy wretchedness</br>Thro' Envy's snares, or Fortune's freaks unkind:</br>I, whether lately thro' her brightness blind,</br>Or thro' allegiance and fast fealty,</br>Which I do owe unto all Womankind,</br>Feel my heart pierc'd with so great agony,</br>When such I see, that all for pity I could die!", "And now it is empassioned so deep,</br>For fairest Una's sake, of whom I sing,</br>That my frail eyes these lines with tears do steep;</br>To think how she, thro' guileful handeling,</br>Tho' true as touch, tho' daughter of a King,</br>Tho' fair as ever living wight was fair,</br>Tho' nor in word nor deed ill meriting,</br>Is from her Knight divorced in despair,</br>And her due loves deriv'd to that vile Witch's share.</br>"]
