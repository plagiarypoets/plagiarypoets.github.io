["Ye swains!  that insult o'er my woe,</br>And make me the jest of the green,</br>What I suffer ye slenderly know,</br>My Phillis ye never have seen.</br>O!  she's lovely as thought can express,</br>As gentle and mild as the dove:</br>I saw her &mdash; and who could do less,</br>I saw, and I could not but love.", "I ne'er told her the anguish I bear,</br>She might think me presumptuous and bold;</br>Ah!  what need of words to declare</br>What my eyes must so often have told!</br>How shall I my love recommend!</br>I may rob all her heart of its ease;</br>And sure I must dread to offend,</br>Whose study is only to please.", "They tell me I'm pensive and grave,</br>Not as formerly cheerful and free;</br>All pleasures contented I wave,</br>That spring not, my Phillis, from thee.</br>Nor riches nor grandeur I mind,</br>Nor titles to flatter my pride;</br>To me, if the Nymph is unkind,</br>All the world's a desart beside.", "At each scene of the well-fabled woe,</br>Where sorrows so forcibly speak,</br>I mark'd the soft current o'erflow,</br>And the tear gently steal down her cheek.</br>I mark'd it!  and, trust me, ye fair!</br>It pleas'd me such softness to see.</br>Can she melt at a fancy'd despair,</br>And not have compassion on me?", "Her voice sounds so silvery sweet,</br>When she tells me there's hope for her swain,</br>My life I'd lay down at her feet</br>But to hear the dear accents again.</br>In expression let others excel,</br>My love is a stranger to art:</br>It may be I speak not so well,</br>Yet, trust me, I speak from the heart.", "May thy days to thy wishes be blest!</br>Mayst thou never have cause to repine!</br>Or, if sorrows thy bosom molest,</br>Oh!  tell them, and they shall be mine.</br>Will my fair one my service deny?</br>My presumption will Phillis forgive?</br>Contented for her I could die,</br>With whom 'twould be Heaven to live.</br>"]
