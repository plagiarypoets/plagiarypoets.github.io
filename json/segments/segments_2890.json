["Some time now past in the Autumnal Tide,</br>When Phoebus wanted but one hour to bed,</br>The trees all richly clad, yet void of pride,</br>Where gilded o're by his rich golden head.</br>Their leaves and fruits seem'd painted, but was true</br>Of green, of red, of yellow, mixed hew,</br>Rapt were my sences at this delectable view.", "I wist not what to wish, yet sure thought I,</br>If so much excellence abide below;</br>How excellent is he that dwells on high?</br>Whose power and beauty by his works we know.</br>Sure he is goodness, wisdome, glory, light,</br>That hath this under world so richly dight:</br>More Heaven then Earth was here no winter and no night.", "Then on a stately Oak I cast mine Eye,</br>Whose ruffling top the Clouds seem'd to aspire;</br>How long since thou wast in thine Infancy?</br>Thy strength, and stature, more thy years admire,</br>Hath hundred winters past since thou wast born?</br>Or thousand since thou brakest thy shell of horn,</br>If so, all these as nought, Eternity doth scorn.", "Then higher on the glistering Sun I gaz'd,</br>Whose beams was shaded by the leavie Tree,</br>The more I look'd, the more I grew amaz'd,</br>And softly said, what glory's like to thee?</br>Soul of this world, this Universes Eye,</br>No wonder, some made thee a Deity:</br>Had I not better known, (alas) the same had I.", "Thou as a Bridegroom from thy Chamber rushes,</br>And as a strong man, joyes to run a race,</br>The morn doth usher thee, with smiles and blushes,</br>The Earth reflects her glances in thy face.</br>Birds, insects, Animals with Vegative,</br>Thy heart from death and dulness doth revive:</br>And in the darksome womb of fruitful nature dive.", "Thy swift Annual, and diurnal Course,</br>Thy daily streight, and yearly oblique path,</br>Thy pleasing fervor, and thy scorching force,</br>All mortals here the feeling knowledg hath.</br>Thy presence makes it day, thy absence night,</br>Quaternal Seasons caused by thy might:</br>Hail Creature, full of sweetness, beauty and delight.", "Art thou so full of glory, that no Eye</br>Hath strength, thy shining Rayes once to behold?</br>And is thy splendid Throne erect so high?</br>As to approach it, can no earthly mould.</br>How full of glory then must thy Creator be?</br>Who gave this bright light luster unto thee:</br>Admir'd, ador'd for ever, be that Majesty.", "Silent alone, where none or saw, or heard,</br>In pathless paths I lead my wandring feet,</br>My humble Eyes to lofty Skyes I rear'd</br>To sing some Song, my mazed Muse thought meet.</br>My great Creator I would magnifie,</br>That nature had, thus decked liberally:</br>But Ah, and Ah, again, my imbecility!", "I heard the merry grashopper then sing,</br>The black clad Cricket, bear a second part,</br>They kept one tune, and plaid on the same string,</br>Seeming to glory in their little Art.</br>Shall Creatures abject, thus their voices raise?</br>And in their kind resound their makers praise:</br>Whilst I as mute, can warble forth no higher layes.", "When present times look back to Ages past,</br>And men in being fancy those are dead,</br>It makes things gone perpetually to last,</br>And calls back moneths and years that long since fled.</br>It makes a man more aged in conceit,</br>Then was Methuselah, or's grand-sire great:</br>While of their persons and their acts his mind doth treat.", "Sometimes in Eden fair, he seems to be,</br>Sees glorious Adam there made Lord of all,</br>Fancyes the Apple, dangle on the Tree,</br>That turn'd his Sovereign to a naked thral.</br>Who like a miscreant's driven from that place,</br>To get his bread with pain, and sweat of face:</br>A penalty impos'd on his backsliding Race.", "Here sits our Grandame in retired place,</br>And in her lap, her bloody Cain new born,</br>The weeping Imp oft looks her in the face,</br>Bewails his unknown hap, and fate forlorn;</br>His Mother sighs, to think of Paradise,</br>And how she lost her bliss, to be more wise,</br>Believing him that was, and is, Father of lyes.", "Here Cain and Abel come to sacrifice,</br>Fruits of the Earth, and Fatlings each do bring,</br>On Abels gift the fire descends from Skies,</br>But no such sign on false Cain's offering;</br>With sullen hateful looks he goes his wayes.</br>Hath thousand thoughts to end his brothers dayes,</br>Upon whose blood his future good he hopes to raise.", "There Abel keeps his sheep, no ill he thinks,</br>His brother comes, then acts his fratricide,</br>The Virgin Earth, of blood her first draught drinks</br>But since that time she often hath been cloy'd;</br>The wretch with gastly face and dreadful mind,</br>Thinks each he sees will serve him in his kind,</br>Though none on Earth but kindred near then could he find.", "Who fancyes not his looks now at the Barr,</br>His face like death, his heart with horror fraught,</br>Nor Male-factor ever felt like warr,</br>When deep dispair, with wish of life hath sought,</br>Branded with guilt, and crusht with treble woes,</br>A Vagabond to Land of Nod he goes.</br>A City builds, that wals might him secure from foes.", "Who thinks not oft upon the Fathers ages.</br>Their long descent, how nephews sons they saw,</br>The starry observations of those Sages,</br>And how their precepts to their sons were law,</br>How Adam sigh'd to see his Progeny,</br>Cloath'd all in his black sinfull Livery,</br>Who neither guilt, nor yet the punishment could fly.", "Our Life compare we with their length of dayes</br>Who to the tenth of theirs doth now arrive?</br>And though thus short, we shorten many wayes,</br>Living so little while we are alive;</br>In eating, drinking, sleeping, vain delight</br>So unawares comes on perpetual night,</br>And puts all pleasures vain unto eternal flight.", "When I behold the heavens as in their prime,</br>And then the earth (though old) stil clad in green,</br>The stones and trees, insensible of time,</br>Nor age nor wrinkle on their front are seen;</br>If winter come, and greeness then do fade,</br>A Spring returns, and they more youthfull made;</br>But Man grows old, lies down, remains where once he's laid.", "By birth more noble then those creatures all,</br>Yet seems by nature and by custome curs'd,</br>No sooner born, but grief and care makes fall</br>That state obliterate he had at first:</br>Nor youth, nor strength, nor wisdom spring again</br>Nor habitations long their names retain,</br>But in oblivion to the final day remain.", "Shall I then praise the heavens, the trees, the earth</br>Because their beauty and their strength last longer</br>Shall I wish there, or never to had birth,</br>Because they're bigger, and their bodyes stronger?</br>Nay, they shall darken, perish, fade and dye,</br>And when unmade, so ever shall they lye,</br>But man was made for endless immortality.", "Under the cooling shadow of a stately Elm</br>Close sate I by a goodly Rivers side,</br>Where gliding streams the Rocks did overwhelm;</br>A lonely place, with pleasures dignifi'd.</br>I once that lov'd the shady woods so well,</br>Now thought the rivers did the trees excel,</br>And if the sun would ever shine, there would I dwell.", "While on the stealing stream I fixt mine eye,</br>Which to the long'd for Ocean held its course,</br>I markt, nor crooks, nor rubs that there did lye</br>Could hinder ought, but still augment its force:</br>O happy Flood, quoth I, that holds thy race</br>Till thou arrive at thy beloved place,</br>Nor is it rocks or shoals that can obstruct thy pace.", "Nor is't enough, that thou alone may'st slide,</br>But hundred brooks in thy cleer waves do meet,</br>So hand in hand along with thee they glide</br>To Thetis house, where all imbrace and greet:</br>Thou Emblem true, of what I count the best,</br>O could I lead my Rivolets to rest,</br>So may we press to that vast mansion, ever blest.", "Ye Fish which in this liquid Region 'bide,</br>That for each season, have your habitation,</br>Now salt, now fresh where you think best to glide</br>To unknown coasts to give a visitation,</br>In Lakes and ponds, you leave your numerous fry,</br>So nature taught, and yet you know not why,</br>You watry folk that know not your felicity.", "Look how the wantons frisk to tast the air,</br>Then to the colder bottome streight they dive,</br>Eftsoon to Neptun's glassie Hall repair</br>To see what trade they great ones there do drive,</br>Who forrage o're the spacious sea-green field,</br>And take the trembling prey before it yield,</br>Whose armour is their scales, their spreading fins their shield.", "While musing thus with contemplation fed,</br>And thousand fancies buzzing in my brain,</br>The sweet-tongu'd Philomel percht ore my head,</br>And chanted forth a most melodious strain</br>Which rapt me so with wonder and delight,</br>I judg'd my hearing better then my sight,</br>And wisht me wings with her a while to

might thee harm</br>Thy cloaths ne're wear, thy meat is every where,</br>Thy bed a bough, thy drink the water cleer,</br>Reminds not what is past, nor whats to come dost fear.", "The dawning morn with songs thou dost prevent,</br>Sets hundred notes unto thy feathered crew,</br>So each one tunes his pretty instrument,</br>And warbling out the old, begin anew,</br>And thus they pass their youth in summer season,</br>Then follow thee into a better Region,</br>Where winter's never felt by that sweet airy legion.", "Man at the best a creature frail and vain,</br>In knowledg ignorant, in strength but weak,</br>Subject to sorrows, losses, sickness, pain,</br>Each storm his state, his mind, his body break,</br>From some of these he never finds cessation,</br>But day or night, within, without,

curtains over kings,</br>Their sumptuous monuments, men know them not,</br>Their names without a Record are forgot,</br>Their parts, their ports, their pomp's all laid in th' dust</br>Nor wit nor gold, nor buildings scape times rust;</br>But he whose name is grav'd in the white stone</br>Shall last and shine when all of these are gone.</br>"]
