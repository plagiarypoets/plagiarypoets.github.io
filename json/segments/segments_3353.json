["Ye shepherds who cheerfully pipe through the day,</br>Attend to a lover's enraptured lay;</br>His song is of beauty, you love the dear theme,</br>For ELIZA and beauty are ever the same.", "Give joy to the village where beauty resides,</br>Where sweet sensibility sweetly presides,</br>Where virtue triumphant enjoys a soft reign,</br>For ELIZA and virtue are ever the same.", "I know your good hearts will accord in the praise</br>Of all the bright precepts which virtue conveys;</br>Rejoice, where with virtue true wisdom I name,</br>For ELIZA and wisdom are ever the same.", "The Graces adorn and embellish the fair,</br>To you, my dear shepherds, the Graces are dear;</br>Then haste and do homage to her I proclaim,</br>For ELIZA and gracefulness still are the same.", "O!  should the dear maiden, inspir'd from above,</br>But smile on fond DAMON, who dies for her love;</br>Dear shepherds! how joyfully should I exclaim,</br>ELIZA and happiness now are the same!</br>"]
