["Unlike the once grave train that's here immur'd,</br>The jocund Florio found a recent grave;</br>Not florid health precarious life secur'd,</br>Nor youths nor blooming virgins tear could save.", "Where's that creative fancy's sparkling glee,</br>Whose rapid sallies shook the circle round,</br>Till, like the lighting's burst, his repartee</br>Bad the peal'd roar from festive roofs rebound?", "Where's the kind social pow'rs he once possess'd,</br>That rais'd the heart, and bad the spirits glow;</br>The gen'rous wish to make all mankind blest,</br>And feeling heart to lighten ev'ry woe?", "What tho' th' enliv'ning bloom of fancy fades,</br>Th' awak'ning glow, and social sweetness fled;</br>Beyond Time's weary flight the soul pervades,</br>And soars to regions sacred to the dead.", "This gen'rous hope should fan th' aetherial fire,</br>This only worth ambition's glorious aim,</br>To raise the soul above its frail desire,</br>And slight th' amusive impotence of Fame.</br>"]
