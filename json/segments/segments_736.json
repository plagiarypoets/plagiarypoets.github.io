["When in the opening of the youthful Year,</br>Sol in Aquarius bathes his glistering Ray;</br>In early Morn the Fields all white appear,</br>With hoary Frost is cover'd every Spray:</br>And every Herb and every Grass is shent,</br>All in the chill Imprisonment ypent.", "The mean-clad Swain, forth issuing from his Cot,</br>Looks sadly all around the whitening Waste;</br>And grieves that his poor Sheep, by Heaven forgot,</br>Can find no Food, no tender Green to taste:</br>He beats his Breast as one distract, or mad;</br>And home returns, with pensive Look and sad.", "There silent grieves.  Then once again looks out,</br>And sees the Groves and Meads quite alter'd are.</br>The Sun has cast his melting Rays about,</br>And every Green appears more fresh and fair.</br>Then Hope returns, and Joy unknits his Brows,</br>And forth he leads his Flock the tender Grass to brouze.", "Thus when my Fair One views me with Disdain,</br>My Heart is sunk within me, sad and dead;</br>My Spirits yield, and all my Soul's in Pain;</br>I sit and sigh, and hang my drooping Head:</br>But if she smile, my Sadness melts away,</br>Each gloomy Thought clears up, and I'm all blithe and gay.</br>"]
