["Mute is that tongue which late would squeal so shrill,</br>Clos'd are those eyes oft to thy safety true;</br>Unmov'd the limbs which oft so nimbly mov'd,</br>When the replenish'd trough stood full in view.", "The cruel knife has drank thy spouting blood,</br>And unrelenting pierc'd thy beating heart,</br>Had laid thee weltering in a crimson flood,</br>And soon forever, must thy breath depart.", "No more thou'lt range the wood, by instinct led,</br>Or, with thy kindred pigs, the spacious field,</br>In search of nut or acorn newly shed,</br>Or root nutritious 'neath the turf conceal'd;", "No more with mischief fraught, and nose upheld,</br>Seek the sly breach in fence or tumbling wall,</br>Through which to steal, and in the cultur'd field</br>Lay waste and riot on the lab'rer's toil.", "Ah!  little didst thou think, when in the stye</br>Thy master fed thee with such watchful care,</br>With corn, potatoes boil'd, and mouldy rye,</br>Thy life would pay for such delicious fare.", "Full many a bard in lofty verse has sung</br>The praise of heroes and of patriots true,</br>Of wisdom's sons; and in sweet melting strains</br>Fond lovers oft the listening maidens woo.", "And not alone have themes like these inspir'd</br>The maddening, sublime, or melting song,</br>But broken mugs, pipes, cats, and dogs have fir'd</br>The Muse to sing with pity-waking tongue.", "Shall then thy parting breath expire unsung,</br>Thou swine of varied and sensual worth?</br>Shall black oblivion enshroud thy fate?</br>Forbid it Justice stern, forbid it truth.", "Thy passing worth, when smoaking on the board</br>Thou'rt laid; and briskly move the knife and fork;</br>The gorging epicure shall oft declare,</br>And all who like fat bacon or good pork.</br>"]
