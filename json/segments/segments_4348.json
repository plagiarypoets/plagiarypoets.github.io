["Since Daphne will hear me complain,</br>No longer my sorrows I'll hide;</br>But, Oh!  how unwelcome the strain,</br>Which tells us that Florimel dy'd.</br>She dy'd!  but Oh!  why was it mine</br>The sorrowful tale to relate?</br>But tho' 'twere a fault to repine,</br>Allow me to mourn at her fate.", "So young to be snatch'd from our arms!</br>Ere nature perfection had wrought;</br>But tho' we're depriv'd of her charms,</br>Her virtues can ne'er be forgot.</br>Oh!  Death too relentless to spare</br>In Florimel all that could please;</br>In Florimel all that was dear,</br>And 'reft us of comfort and ease.", "But hence let me haste to the grove,</br>And there strive to solace my grief;</br>Since pastimes no pleasure can prove,</br>And mirth can afford no relief;</br>Then yearly when maids shall attend,</br>Oh!  be it with sorrow exprest,</br>That, once the gay hope of each friend,</br>Now silently sleeps in the dust.</br>"]
