["With furious Look, and with a Mighty Sound,</br>From Window peeping, Andrew gave the Cry.</br>So glance the Lightnings downward to the Ground,</br>So growling Thunders shade the frighted Sky.</br>For P&mdash; and M&mdash; Andrew stretch'd his Throat;</br>No Friend but Andrew to provoke the Strife!</br>And Alien in the Land, with scarce a Vote,</br>More vain, more mean, more vulgar than his Wife.</br>Thou silly, prating, self-important Fellow,</br>Resume thy proper Garb, dear Andrew, red and yellow.</br>"]
