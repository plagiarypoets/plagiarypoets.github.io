["Again Britannia's navies sweep</br>With victor prow the azure deep;</br>Again resounds her cannons' roar</br>In thund'ring peels from shore to shore,</br>And loud proclaims her boundless reign</br>O'er hoary Ocean's wide domain.</br>While Gaul her pow'r with horror views,</br>No more her empty threats renews,</br>Sunk in despair with madd'ning fury raves,</br>And yields to Albion's sons the empire of the waves.", "Lo!  now th' applauding voice of Fame</br>Wafts o'er the deep her NELSON'S name:</br>Afric's glad sons enraptur'd glow</br>To see o'erwhelm'd their haughty foe;</br>Rush to the shore a numerous band,</br>To hail the saviour of their land,</br>Proclaim his name from pole to pole,</br>Far as his waves old Ocean roll:</br>While on brave Nelson's praise dwells every Briton's tongue,</br>For him are blessings pour'd, for him are paeans sung.", "No more shall Gallia proudly boast,</br>To rear her standard on our coast;</br>No more her fleet triumphant ride,</br>'Whelm'd in old Ocean's briny tide;</br>Still shall Britannia's happy isle</br>Be blest with Plenty's bounteous smile;</br>Still shall fair Commerce waft her stores</br>On every wave to Britain's shores;</br>And here blest Liberty her empire keep,</br>And give to Britain's sons the empire of the deep.</br>"]
