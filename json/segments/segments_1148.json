["Now, courteous reader, say with what intent,</br>These drowsy ditties mean'st thou to peruse?</br>Certes, I wot, because thy mind thou'rt bent</br>With wassel flights of fancy to amuse.</br>But thy unweeting hopes will thee abuse;</br>For if thou look'st in this disporting strain,</br>To trace the footsteps of a sapient Muse,</br>Ah me!  thine expectations will be vain&mdash;</br>Ne wilt thou in it find great pleasance, eke nor pain.", "But be not wroth &mdash; for these quaint roundelays</br>Withouten dulcet reed, a boyish elf</br>Did pen, nor smit with idle love of praise,</br>Nor did he court the Muse for dirty pelf,</br>But only sought to entertain himself:</br>And if devoid of worth thou dost them ween,</br>Eftsoons consign them to thy little shelf&mdash;</br>For ah!  forfend thou should'st annoy thine eyne,</br>His madrigals to read so meritless and mean!", "He (stripling lad!) can boast no classic fire</br>To warble wild, or nip with satire's stripe,</br>Nathless he yet may learn to thrum the lyre,</br>When he with manhood's grace is fairly ripe.&mdash;</br>Meanwhile dull languor from thy mind to wipe,</br>Straight to thy shelf for Maister Spencer go,</br>Dan Pope, or Young, who deftly blew the pipe,</br>And hie to where the welt'ring waters flow,</br>And sit thee on a sod, and read their tales of woe.</br>"]
