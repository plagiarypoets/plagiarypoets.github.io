["Yes, doubts and griefs may cloud my cheerless day,</br>But peace attends the visions of the night,</br>For then, in fair and magical array,</br>The loved and lost, the beautiful and bright,</br>Come round my pillow in a sparkling train,</br>Charming my thoughts to long past hours again.", "I see their sweet familiar forms, I hear</br>Voices that spoke erewhile of love and truth,</br>And household scenes to early feeling dear,</br>Return, array'd in all the glow of youth,</br>Ere sordid cares, and grovelling thoughts of earth,</br>Had chill'd the festive board, the joyous hearth.", "And when I wake, and o'er my troubled heart,</br>Comes the dim consciousness of pleasures fled,</br>Sadly I turn from life's deceptive art,</br>To mourn the tried fond friendships of the dead;</br>Yet sweet and soothing the reflection seems,</br>That I can view them in the land of dreams.", "And not, I trust, in vain, these forms of love</br>Their radiant visits on my sleep bestow,</br>They seem bright heralds from a world above,</br>They bid me tread their holy steps below,</br>And seek and pray to join them on that shore,</br>Where sever'd friends shall meet &mdash; to part no more.</br>"]
