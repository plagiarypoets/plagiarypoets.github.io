["Greece!  glorious Greece!  what art thou but a name?</br>The echo of a cataract gone by?</br>The once victorious voice of all thy fame,</br>Which awed the world, now trembles in a sigh;</br>And I will sing thy glory's lullaby&mdash;</br>For I have loved thee, Greece, &mdash; and o'er the lyre</br>Faintly and sadly shall my fingers fly&mdash;</br>The mournful cadence dies upon the wire,</br>And on the desolate winds, those melodies expire!", "Yes!  I have loved thee &mdash; and my youthful soul</br>Hath wildly dreamt of glory, and of thee&mdash;</br>Burst the proud links of man's severe controul,</br>And sprung to sojourn with the great and free!</br>Oh!  who would not thy vot'ry, Graecia, be?</br>And I have hung upon th' enchanted page</br>Entranced, &mdash; and wept thy fallen liberty&mdash;</br>Till my breast thrill'd with all the patriot's rage,</br>And soar'd aloft, to greet the hero, poet, sage.", "Where art thou, Athens, and what art thou now?</br>Thy spirit even, exalted land, is free!&mdash;</br>Though wither'd, yet the laurel shades thy brow&mdash;</br>The desolate all that now remains of thee,</br>Mother of arts, and arms, and liberty!</br>A lovely corse, encircled by a wreath</br>Of faded flowers, my heart alone can see&mdash;</br>And I will love thee, though despoil'd of breath,</br>For thou art beauteous, Graecia, e'en in death!</br>"]
