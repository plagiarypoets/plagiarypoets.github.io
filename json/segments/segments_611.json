["Wild with his Grief, young COLIN fled</br>His Flocks and Plains, and sought a Grove,</br>Where cover'd with a gloomy shade,</br>He thus bemoan'd his hapless Love:</br>While Rocks stood round and catch'd his cries,</br>And Winds flew by, and sigh'd his Sighs.", "A Tyrant rules within thy Mind,</br>Thy Heart's as hard as flinty Stone,</br>More cruel than mad Storms of Wind,</br>And Rage it self is sooner won:</br>The swelling Billows on the Sea,</br>Are gentle Things, compar'd with thee.", "In the bleak Regions of the Pole,</br>Dread Hills of Snow perpetual rise,</br>And Frost forbids the Streams to roll,</br>And Seas congeal in Alps of Ice:</br>Not all that frigid Zone can prove,</br>A scene so cold as SILVIA'S Love.", "The Bees pursue the yellow Thyme,</br>And warbling Birds rejoyce in May;</br>Round Oaks, the clasping Ivies twine,</br>And youthful Lambs enjoy their play;</br>Each Creature has its Sport and Joy,</br>And nothing's always curs'd but I.", "Clouds will not always hide the Skie,</br>Nor Show'rs forever swell the Streams;</br>For Vapours vanish as they fly,</br>Serene succeeds, and genial Gleams,</br>All human Ills a respite find,</br>And nought but SILVIA'S still unkind.", "Time stops not in its Course to flow,</br>But runs a-round as roll the Spheres;</br>Brings Winters and our Summers too,</br>And Days and Nights compleat the Years:</br>But Time can ne'er by all his Art,</br>Dissolve my SILVIA'S marble Heart.", "Nor Wit, nor Verse, avail me more,</br>They but augment and swell my Fire;</br>I robb'd the Muse and spent her Store,</br>I struck the Strings, and smote the Lyre:</br>But ah!  in Vain I found all these,</br>As Pray'rs to Winds, or Sighs to Seas.", "Then farewel Wit and Verse, no more</br>Shall you delude my fond Desire;</br>And farewel Muse with all thy store,</br>Be broke the Strings, be dumb the Lyre:</br>To ev'ry Art of Love adieu,</br>And to the Charms of SILVIA too.</br>"]
