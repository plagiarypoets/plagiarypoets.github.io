["O Goddess, on whose steps attend</br>Pleasure and laughter-loving health,</br>White mantled peace with olive wand,</br>Young joy, and diamond-scepter'd wealth,</br>Blyth plenty with her loaded horn,</br>With science, bright ey'd as the morn,</br>In Britain, which, for ages past,</br>Has been thy choicest darling care,</br>Who mad'st her wise, and strong, and fair;</br>May thy blest blessings ever last.", "For thee the pining pris'ner mourns,</br>Depriv'd of food, of mirth, of light;</br>For thee pale slaves, to gallies chain'd,</br>That ply tough oars from morn to night;</br>Thee the proud sultan's beauteous train,</br>By eunuchs guarded, weep in vain,</br>Tearing the roses from their locks;</br>And Guinea's captive kings lament,</br>By christian lords to labour sent,</br>Whipt like the dull, unfeeling ox.", "Inspir'd by thee, deaf to fond nature's cries,</br>Stern Brutus, when Rome's genius loudly spoke,</br>Gave her the matchless filial sacrifice,</br>Nor turn'd, nor trembled at the deathful stroke;</br>And he of latest age, but equal fame,</br>Dar'd stab the tyrant, tho' he lov'd the friend.</br>How burnt the Spartan with warm patriot flame,</br>In thy great cause his valorous life to end!</br>How burst Gustavus from the Swedish mine!</br>Like light from chaos dark, eternally to shine.", "When heav'n to all thy joys bestows,</br>And graves upon our hearts &mdash; be free&mdash;</br>Shall coward man those joys resign,</br>And dare reverse this great decree,</br>Submit him to some idol king,</br>Some selfish, passion-guided thing,</br>Abhorring man, by man abhorr'd,</br>Around whose throne stands trembling doubt,</br>Whose jealous eyes still roll about,</br>And murder, with his reeking sword!", "Where tramping tyranny with fate</br>And black revenge, gigantic goes,</br>Hark, how the dying infants shriek!</br>How hopeless age is sunk in woes!</br>Fly mortals from that fated land,</br>Though rivers roll o'er golden sand,</br>Though birds in shades of cassia sing,</br>Harvest and fruits spontaneous rise,</br>No storms disturb the smiling skies,</br>And each soft breeze rich odours bring.", "Britannia watch, &mdash; remember peerless Rome,</br>Her high tower'd head dash'd meanly to the ground;</br>Remember, freedom's guardian, Grecia's doom,</br>Whom weeping the despotic Turk has bound:</br>May ne'er thy oak-crown'd hill, rich meads and downs,</br>(Fame, virtue, courage, poverty, forgot)</br>Thy peaceful villages, and busy towns,</br>Be doom'd some death-dispensing tyrant's lot;</br>On deep foundations may thy freedom stand,</br>Long as the surge shall lash thy sea-encircled land.</br>"]
