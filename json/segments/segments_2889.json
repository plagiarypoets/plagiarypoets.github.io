["Far in a deep sequester'd glade,</br>By fairy hands enchanting made,</br>Their favour'd child, young Spencer, lov'd to stray;</br>The while the sportive forms would tread</br>With light step round his infant head,</br>And fill with dreams divine the future lay.", "Strange were the visions, strange and fair!</br>And changeful as the varying air,</br>When Summer's sun contends with Winter's snow;</br>And now the scene was overcast,</br>Danger and fear were in the blast;</br>And now 'twas lovely light's seraphic glow.", "That darken'd scene in terror told,</br>Of noble knights, and Pagans bold,</br>Of battles dire, and virtue's deep distress;</br>Of sages deep in magic read,</br>Whose potent spells awoke the dead,</br>That lovely light was Heavenly Holiness.", "On either side a hallow'd pair,</br>Friendship and Temperance were there;</br>Fairest of all a vestal pageant rose,</br>Of Chastity by Vice essay'd,</br>And still triumphant, though betray'd,</br>For Heaven was there, and scatter'd all its foes.", "Now came the day, the dreams were gone,</br>Which all the night so lovely shone,</br>And wav'd their wings around the sleeping child,</br>But deep within his infant breast,</br>The fleeting visions left imprest</br>Their high romantic forms, and features wild.</br>"]
