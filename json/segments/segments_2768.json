["Bright goddess of immortal song,</br>From heav'n descend, and bring along</br>Fame, Concord, Liberty and Truth,</br>Still blooming in immortal youth;</br>Fair emblems of the prince, whose praise</br>Wou'd grace the Greek or Roman lays,</br>The grateful voice of rescued arts,</br>Th' applause of tongues, the love of hearts,</br>Who can so justly claim, as he,</br>To whom we owe that we are free?", "When Faction late with direful force</br>Against Britannia urg'd her course,</br>Pale with her fears she pensive sate,</br>And ey'd the gathering storms of fate.</br>Abroad attack'd &mdash; at home betray'd,</br>She rather wish'd, than hop'd for aid;</br>Yet turn'd to heav'n, and George her eyes,</br>Heav'n smil'd!  George bids her hero rise,</br>And in his own effulgence drest,</br>Give the desponding nation rest.</br>William allur'd by glory's charms,</br>Flew with a lover's haste to arms.</br>But as the eaglet's lofty flight,</br>To distance awes the dastard kite,</br>Abash'd th' invader shunn'd his view,</br>And from the destin'd prey withdrew.</br>Yet Caledonia mourn'd her thrall,</br>And William heard the wak'ning call.</br>She sees the young Alcides nigh,</br>Her head is rais'd, her eyes are dry.</br>She points to Falkirk's desart plain,</br>Where fierce Rebellion arms her train.</br>But soon as William's voice she hears,</br>Her rapid flight confest her fears.</br>O'er heaths, o'er hills that touch the skies</br>She bounds, and ev'ry nerve she tries;</br>O'er pathless rocks, thro' wintry snows,</br>As swift her firm pursuer goes,</br>Rapine to drive thro' ev'ry place;</br>William thinks this a glorious chace.</br>Till hopeless now that flight could save,</br>(For cowards in despair are brave,)</br>Near Inverness the Sorceress stands,</br>And summons all her savage bands.</br>Resolv'd, her utmost pow'r she try'd</br>To stab fair Freedom, &mdash; ere she dy'd.", "Her fate drew near! &mdash; the season smiles,</br>And William pleas'd, renews his toils;</br>And thro' the rapid waves of Spey,</br>With ardour leads his troops the way.</br>At length &mdash; his hopes by heav'n are crown'd,</br>With joy the foe he sought is found;</br>Nor long the strife &mdash; for what avail</br>The clamour loud, and wild assail,</br>When valour calm with conduct joins,</br>And this fulfils what that designs?</br>Nought of the tumult now remains,</br>But heaps of foes that spread the plains.", "O chief belov'd &mdash; whom heav'n befriends,</br>Rais'd for the noblest, happiest ends!</br>To thee let grateful nations pay</br>Their thanks for this decisive day.</br>How could thy Britons but with pride</br>Face death &mdash; to conquest thou their guide?", "Yet not the deeds, thy sword atchiev'd,</br>Nor foes subdu'd, nor friends reliev'd,</br>Not the loud voice of sounding Fame,</br>Inspir'd, delighted with thy name,</br>With half the joy cou'd fill thy breast,</br>As Britain's publick thanks exprest.", "Let other hearts false zeal inspire,</br>To set the suff'ring world on fire,</br>On ruin'd nations trophies raise,</br>And purchase guilty, shameful praise;</br>'Tis William's aim &mdash; and juster pride,</br>To fight on TRUTH'S and FREEDOM'S side,</br>To guard the rights by heav'n assign'd</br>To bless, a prince's charge, &mdash; mankind.</br>"]
