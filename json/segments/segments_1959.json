["Consign'd to mingle with his parent earth,</br>His name in distant lands will ne'er be known;</br>Dull apathy presided at his birth,</br>And ignorance mark'd the infant for her own.", "Confined within the workhouse' lofty wall,</br>When time revolving brought a holiday,</br>Elated, he obeyed the festive call,</br>And sallied forth with shreds of ribbands, gay.", "Soldiers, at wake or fair, he lov'd to meet,</br>Their martial trophies view'd without a fear;</br>And when in gay parade they pass'd the street,</br>With shouting boys he follow'd in the rear.", "On batter'd water-pot in lieu of drum,</br>With varied measure beat the loud tattoo;</br>Press'd through the crowd, regardless of its hum,</br>Nor would his clattering melody forego.", "When wrangling blockheads, for contention ripe,</br>Disturb'd with clam'rous din the evening's cheer;</br>Unmindful of the noise, he smok'd his pipe,</br>Or bade the waiter fill his mug with beer.", "While thus abroad unwittingly he stray'd,</br>The love of freedom in his bosom burn'd;</br>The lapse of time unconscious he survey'd,</br>Nor to his dwelling willingly return'd.", "When prying scouts explor'd his snug retreat,</br>Unvex'd by cares that reasoning mortals goad;</br>Reluctant then, they forc'd him from his seat,</br>And loud reproaches urg'd him on the road.", "As thus through life he ran his even course,</br>Still unillum'd by reason, heavenly guide,</br>He scap'd the piercing stings of keen remorse,</br>For virtue wrong'd, or talents misapply'd.", "Impartial death, that levels all below,</br>Nor spares the conqueror's wreath, nor monarch's crown;</br>Aim'd at his breast the inevitable blow,</br>To mix in dust with names of high renown.", "When o'er his bier the solemn knell had toll'd,</br>Near the dull spot where he was wont to dwell;</br>Consign'd to mingle with his kindred mould,</br>His friends attendant sigh'd a last farewell.</br>"]
