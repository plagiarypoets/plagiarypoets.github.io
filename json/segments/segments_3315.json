["In holyday gown, and my newfangled hat,</br>Last Monday I tript to the fair:</br>I held up my head, and I'll tell you for what,</br>Brisk Roger I guess'd wou'd be there.</br>He woos me to marry whenever we meet,</br>There's honey sure dwells on his tongue!</br>He hugs me so close, and he kisses so sweet,</br>I'd wed &mdash; if I were not too young.", "Fond Sue, I'll assure you, laid hold on the boy,</br>(The vixen wou'd fain be his bride)</br>Some token she claim'd, either ribbon or toy,</br>And swore that she'd not be deny'd.</br>A topnot he bought her, and garters of green,</br>Pert Susan was cruelly stung;</br>I hate her so much, that to kill her with spleen,</br>I'd wed &mdash; if I were not too young.", "He whisper'd such soft pretty things in mine ear!</br>He flatter'd, he promis'd, and swore!</br>Such trinkets he gave me, such laces and geer,</br>That trust me, &mdash; my pockets ran o'er.</br>Some ballads he bought me, the best he could find,</br>And sweetly their burthen he sung:</br>Good faith he's so handsome, so witty, and kind,</br>I'd wed &mdash; if I were not too young.", "The sun was just setting, 'twas time to retire;</br>(Our cottage was distant a mile)</br>I rose to be gone &mdash; Roger bow'd like a squire,</br>And handed my over the stile.</br>His arms he threw round me &mdash; love laugh'd in is eye,</br>He led me the meadows among,</br>There prest me so close, I agreed, with a sigh,</br>To wed &mdash; for I was not too young.</br>"]
