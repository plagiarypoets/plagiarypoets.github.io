["Thy spirit hath a pure, embalming ray,</br>E'en like the sun, with his all-silvering light,</br>That sweetly sheds its glory through the day,</br>And lends us its reflection still at night&mdash;</br>Falling on every hill and mountain bright,</br>And forest dark, and sweet and quiet vale,</br>Bringing a thousand beauties to the sight,</br>That else had been unseen, or dim and pale;</br>Filling our souls in summer with delight,</br>And making winter's snowy robe more dazzling white.", "Thus, o'er the world of human feeling, thou</br>Hast shed the glory of thy thrilling song&mdash;</br>Lit up its pinnacles to flash and glow,</br>Like stars, that in the deep blue sky do throng,</br>Till its romantic spots are hallowed so,</br>That all of beautiful in woman's love,</br>And all that's noble on the hero's brow,</br>All that resembles holiness above,</br>All that we venerate on earth below,</br>Unconscious in thy song to tenfold beauty grow.", "The Pilgrim Fathers!  how its light doth stream</br>And flash in glory o'er that thoughtful band;</br>In the clear brightness of its magic gleam,</br>Not dimly seen, those various forms are scanned.</br>With burning thoughts they tread the rock-bound strand,</br>The hoary head, the frank, free face of youth,</br>The dear child clinging to the father's hand,</br>Stern manhood's brow, and woman's eye of truth&mdash;</br>A mingled crowd upon that wished for land,</br>Oh!  more than Plato's dream, devoutly there they stand!", "The lays of many lands &mdash; they are thine own&mdash;</br>Yet hast thou twined them with such feelings dear</br>To all free hearts, and they have such a tone,</br>Ye may not strike them in the tyrant's ear,</br>Nor can the coward heart their music hear.</br>Some should be sung around the peaceful hearth,</br>For they are loved by all the dwellers there,</br>And mid domestic scenes had their own birth,</br>Scenes, e'en the wicked in their hearts revere&mdash;</br>Some in the battle heard, the freeman's soul might cheer.", "Thou hast a voice, a glad voice for the spring,</br>And harvest hath a song of music quick,</br>And joyous chords the bridal morning ring;</br>But other notes than these for the sad wreck,</br>The faithful boy on that still burning deck,</br>The last, long look to him who was so dear,</br>The settled paleness on the cold, dead check,</br>The solemn chant, slow pealed by the sad bier,</br>The reft one's grief that is too deep to speak,</br>Woman's strong love, for which all words but thine are weak.", "And thou hast thrown o'er all thy blessed songs</br>A veil of feminine thought, that still doth greet</br>The soul with joy that not to earth belongs,</br>A charm from thine own heart, that when we meet</br>Thy much loved verse, it tells of thy retreat;</br>Even as those shells, thrown by the flowing sea</br>In polished beauty at our careless feet,</br>More exquisitely fair than art can be,</br>Far from their native ocean still repeat</br>Forever its loved roar, in mimic murmurs sweet.</br>"]
