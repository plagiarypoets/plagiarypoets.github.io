["Dear Chloe, what means this Disdain,</br>Which blasts each Endeavour to please?</br>Though Forty, I am free from all Pain;</br>Save Love, I am free from Disease.</br>No Graces my Mansion have fled,</br>No Muses have broken my Lyre;</br>The Loves frolic still round my Bed,</br>And Laughter is chear'd at my Fire.", "To none have I ever been cold,</br>All Beauties in Vogue I'm among;</br>I've Appetite e'en for the Old,</br>And Spirit enough for the Young.</br>Believe me, sweet Girl, I speak true,</br>Or else put my Love to the Test;</br>Some others have doubted like you,</br>Like them do you bless and be blest.</br>"]
