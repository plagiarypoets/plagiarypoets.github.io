["When the tempest howls rough thro' the dark wither'd grove,</br>And the rude blasts of Winter all Nature deform;</br>Amid the dire scenes unappall'd I could rove,</br>And rest undisturb'd by the rage of the storm.", "Yet why, when the wild winds of Winter are flown,</br>When hush'd to repose are the waves on the sea;</br>When Spring o'er the earth her green mantle has thrown,</br>And the sweet voice of gladness is heard from each tree:", "When all the fair objects that earth can bestow,</br>Combine to inspire me with transports of joy,</br>O why on my tongue dwell the accents of woe?</br>Why bursts from my bosom the sorrow-fraught sigh?", "When the blushes of morn tinge the clouds of the east,</br>I seek the lone cave on the wave-beaten shore</br>Where the sea-bird screams wild as she starts from her nest,</br>And the loud-sounding surge in the hollow rocks roar:", "I mark the tall cliff, hoary, rugged, and bare,</br>That rears its broad breast in the midst of the waves,</br>Where the mermaid, they say, often combs her dark hair,</br>And sings o'er the sailors that rest in their graves.", "When the sun sinks behind the high hills of the west,</br>All lonely and pensive I rest by the stream,</br>I call to remembrance the days that are past,</br>And compare all my joys to the suns' setting beam.", "I see with regret where the hawthorn stood,</br>And the yellow furze blossom'd, the marks of the plough,</br>Yet pleas'd I behold the rock shatter'd and rude,</br>And view with delight the bleak mountain's bare brow.", "Beneath the green elm waving dark in the air,</br>Oft I sit while the moon lights her lamp in the sky&mdash;</br>Ah!  why must I tell that my Peggy sleeps there,</br>And that there all my hopes and my happiness lye?</br>"]
