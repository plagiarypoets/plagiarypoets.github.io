["As round my sweet garden I rove,</br>And revel with Shenstone's gay verse,</br>I feel the calm glowings of love,</br>And strive Phoebus' charms to rehearse.", "I pause at the rose's gay form,</br>'Tis beauty and innocence join'd;</br>No spots the chaste lily deform,</br>For virtue in her is combin'd;", "No flow'ret that decks the gay scene,</br>The jess'mine or hyacinth sweet,</br>But unite in pourtraying her mien,</br>So elegant, beauteous, and neat.", "The fragrance that gracefully breathes,</br>The sun-shine that gilds my small cot,</br>Fills my bosom with joy &mdash; and it heaves,</br>Since to Phoebe I owe the sweet spot.", "The choir in the grove now begin,</br>To chear with new charms the glad scene;</br>Oh haste thee then, Phoebe, and sing,</br>Sigh out thy harmonious strain.", "With murmurs so charming then bless,</br>Oh!  bless the fond youth who does rove,</br>Thy fond partial bosom to press,</br>And breathe out soft accents of love.", "Reclin'd in yon shady alcove,</br>Thy converse my murmurs will glad;</br>Thy song and thy thoughts interwove,</br>Thy swain will make happy &mdash; now sad.</br>"]
