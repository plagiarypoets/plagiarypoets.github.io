["O Fountain of the wood!  whose glassy wave</br>Slow-welling from the rock of years,</br>Holds to heav'n a mirrour blue,</br>And bright as ANNA'S eye,", "With whom I've sported on the margin green:</br>My hand with leaves, with lilies white,</br>Gaily deck'd her golden hair,</br>Young NAIAD of the vale.", "Fount of my native wood!  thy murmurs greet</br>My ear, like poets heav'nly strain:</br>Fancy pictures in a dream</br>The golden days of youth.", "O state of innocence!  O paradise!</br>In Hope's gay garden, Fancy views</br>Golden blossoms, golden fruits,</br>And EDEN ever green.", "Where now, ye dear companions of my youth!</br>Ye brothers of my bosom!  where</br>Do ye tread the walks of life,</br>Wide scatter'd o'er the world?", "Thus winged larks forsake their native nest,</br>The merry minstrels of the morn;</br>New to heav'n they mount away,</br>And meet again no more.", "All things decay; the forest like the leaf;</br>Great kingdoms fall; the peopled globe,</br>Planet-struck, shall pass away;</br>Heav'ns with their hosts expire:", "But Hope's fair visions, and the beams of Joy,</br>Shall chear my bosom:  I will sing</br>Nature's beauty, Nature's birth,</br>And heroes on the lyre.", "Ye NAIADS!  blue-eyed sisters of the wood!</br>Who by old oak, or storied stream,</br>Nightly tread your mystic maze,</br>And charm the wand'ring Moon,", "Beheld by poet's eye; inspire my dreams</br>With visions, like the landscapes fair</br>Of heav'n's bliss, to dying saints</br>By guardian angels drawn.", "Fount of the forest!  in thy poet's lays</br>Thy waves shall flow:  this wreath of flow'rs,</br>Gather'd by my ANNA'S hand,</br>I ask to bind my brow.</br>"]
