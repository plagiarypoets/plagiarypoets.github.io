["Snuffers, that oft were wont, with kindly aid,</br>The glimmering taper's dim expiring light</br>To reassure; and while, in absent plight,</br>Thy master studious hung his lumpish head,</br>The toil-deriding snuff with edge abrade;</br>What sacrilegious hand thy rivets bright,</br>Thrice polish'd, quaint, and pleasant to the sight,</br>Hath ruthless sever'd? &mdash; Now, when Night her shade</br>Hath spread o'er all the desolated room,</br>How may I chace away the dusk ambiguous?</br>And yon dim taper, \"counterfeiting gloom,\"</br>Vivid restore? &mdash; Or, to some cell contiguous</br>For aid I manful cry; or (hapless doom!)</br>Curtail th' aspiring snuff with thumb irriguous.</br>"]
