["The bulfinch no music can boast,</br>While wandering the gardens among,</br>But nature, when freedom is lost,</br>Endows the poor captive with song.</br>So, I, ere thy heart could approve,</br>Regarded not melody's page,</br>But now I am fetter'd by love,</br>And with sounds I my anguish assuage.", "When I caroll'd of war and of wine,</br>In hopes to abandon my pain,</br>Discordance has mark'd every line,</br>And I've found all my efforts were vain.</br>'Tis the plaintive alone which can please,</br>'Tis the plaintive which soothes my fond soul,</br>Yet often those cordials that ease,</br>Raise a malady 'bove all control.", "The notes of the Lark give me pain,</br>His music too cheerfully flows,</br>But the Robin's soft querulous strain</br>Is in unison still with my woes.</br>I have heard of the Nightingale's lay,</br>But his song to the north is unknown,</br>Ah!  would he but travel this way,</br>I would listen all night to his moan.", "The joyous I cautiously shun,</br>Their mirth is disgusting to me;</br>Nay I loathe e'en the glare of the sun,</br>For it acts on my feelings like glee.</br>When the mole leaves his darksome retreat,</br>When the urchin is seeking for prey,</br>When the poor harass'd hare quits her seat,</br>O'er the moorlands by moonlight I stray.", "When I dream of my love, and awake,</br>Tho' disdain had appear'd in her eye,</br>Chagrin'd, every method I take</br>The delusion again to enjoy.</br>Oh Lucy!  attend to the strain</br>Of one who but feebly can sue,</br>Oh Lucy!  reject not a swain</br>Who loves with a passion so true.</br>"]
