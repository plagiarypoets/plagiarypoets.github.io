["Silent Nymph, with curious Eye!</br>Who, the purple Ev'ning, lye</br>On the Mountain's lonely Van,</br>Beyond the Noise of busy Man,</br>Painting fair the form of Things,</br>While the yellow Linnet sings;</br>Or the tuneful Nightingale</br>Charms the Forest with her Tale;</br>Come with all thy various Hues,</br>Come, and aid thy Sister Muse;</br>Now while Phoebus riding high</br>Gives Lustre to the Land and Sky!</br>Grongar Hill invites my Song,</br>Draw the Landskip bright and strong;</br>Grongar, in whose Mossie Cells</br>Sweetly-musing Quiet dwells:</br>Grongar, in whose silent Shade,</br>For the modest Muses made,</br>So oft I have, the Even still,</br>At the Fountain of a Rill,</br>Sate upon a flow'ry Bed,</br>With my Hand beneath my Head;</br>And stray'd my Eyes o'er Towy's Flood,</br>Over Mead, and over Wood,</br>From House to House, from Hill to Hill,</br>'Till Contemplation had her fill.", "About his chequer'd Sides I wind,</br>And leave his Brooks and Meads behind,</br>And Groves, and Grottoes where I lay,</br>And Vistoes shooting Beams of Day:</br>Wider and wider spreads the Vale;</br>As Circles on a smooth Canal:</br>The Mountains round, unhappy Fate,</br>Sooner or later, of all Height!</br>Withdraw their Summits from the Skies,</br>And lessen as the others rise:</br>Still the Prospect wider spreads,</br>Adds a thousand Woods and Meads,</br>Still it widens, widens still,</br>And sinks the newly-risen Hill.", "Now, I gain the Mountain's Brow,</br>What a Landskip lies below!</br>No Clouds, no Vapours intervene,</br>But the gay, the open Scene</br>Does the Face of Nature show,</br>In all the Hues of Heaven's Bow!</br>And, swelling to embrace the Light,</br>Spreads around beyond the Sight.", "Old Castles on the Cliffs arise,</br>Proudly tow'ring in the Skies!</br>Rushing from the Woods, the Spires</br>Seem from hence ascending Fires!</br>Half his Beams Apollo sheds,</br>On the yellow Mountain-Heads!</br>Gilds the Fleeces of the Flocks;</br>And glitters on the broken Rocks!", "Below me Trees unnumber'd rise,</br>Beautiful in various Dies:</br>The gloomy Pine, the Poplar blue,</br>The  yellow Beech, the sable Yew,</br>The slender Firr, that taper grows,</br>The sturdy Oak with broad-spread Boughs.</br>And beyond the purple Grove,</br>Haunt of Phillis, Queen of Love!</br>Gawdy as the op'ning Dawn,</br>Lies a long and level Lawn,</br>On which a dark Hill, steep and high,</br>Holds and charms the wand'ring Eye!</br>Deep are his Feet in Towy's Flood,</br>His Sides are cloath'd with waving Wood,</br>And antient Towers crown his Brow,</br>That cast an awful Look below;</br>Whose ragged Walls the Ivy creeps,</br>And with her Arms from falling keeps;</br>So both a Safety from the Wind</br>On mutual Dependance find.", "'Tis now the Raven's bleak Abode;</br>'Tis now th' Apartment of the Toad;</br>And there the Fox securely feeds;</br>And there the pois'nous Adder breeds,</br>Conceal'd in Ruins, Moss and Weeds:</br>While, ever and anon, there falls,</br>Huge heaps of hoary moulder'd Walls.</br>Yet Time has seen, that lifts the low,</br>And level lays the lofty Brow,</br>Has seen this broken Pile compleat,</br>Big with the Vanity of State;</br>But transient is the Smile of Fate!</br>A little Rule, a little Sway,</br>A Sun-beam in a Winter's Day</br>Is all the Proud and Mighty have,</br>Between the Cradle and the Grave.", "And see the Rivers how they run,</br>Thro' Woods and Meads, in Shade and Sun,</br>Sometimes swift, and sometimes slow,</br>Wave succeeding Wave they go</br>A various Journey to the Deep,</br>Like human Life to endless Sleep!</br>Thus is Nature's Vesture wrought,</br>To instruct our wand'ring Thought;</br>Thus she dresses green and gay,</br>To disperse our Cares away.", "Ever charming, ever new,</br>When will the Landskip tire the view!</br>The Fountain's Fall, the River's Flow,</br>The woody Vallies, warm and low;</br>The windy Summit, wild and high,</br>Roughly rushing on the Sky!</br>The pleasant Seat, the ruin'd Tow'r,</br>The naked Rock, the shady Bow'r;</br>The Town and Village, Dome and Farm,</br>Each give each a double Charm,</br>As Pearls upon an Aethiop's Arm.", "See on the Mountain's southern side,</br>Where the Prospect opens wide,</br>Where the Ev'ning gilds the tide;</br>How close and small the Hedges lie!</br>What streaks of Meadows cross the Eye!</br>A Step methinks may pass the Stream,</br>So little distant Dangers seem;</br>So we mistake the Future's face,</br>Ey'd thro' Hope's deluding Glass;</br>As yon Summits soft and fair,</br>Clad in Colours of the Air,</br>Which, to those who journey near,</br>Barren, and brown, and rough appear;</br>Still we tread the same coarse Way,</br>The Present's still a cloudy Day.", "Now, ev'n now, my Joy runs high,</br>As on the Mountain turf I lie;</br>While the wanton Zephir sings,</br>And in the Vale perfumes his Wings;</br>While the Waters murmur deep;</br>While the Shepherd charms his Sheep;</br>While the Birds unbounded fly,</br>And with Musick fill the Sky.</br>Now, ev'n now, my Joy runs high,", "Be full, ye Courts, be great who will;</br>Open wide the lofty Door,</br>Seek her  on the marble Floor,</br>In vain ye search, she is not there;</br>In vain ye search the Domes of Care!</br>Grass and Flowers Quiet treads,</br>On the Meads, and Mountain-heads,</br>Along with Pleasure, close ally'd,</br>Ever by each other's Side:</br>And often, by the murm'ring Rill,</br>Hears the Thrush, while all is still,</br>Within the Groves of Grongar Hill.</br>"]
