["Yes!  it is quench'd &mdash; the spark of heavenly fire,</br>That Genius kindled in my infant mind:</br>Fled is my fancy:  damp'd the fond desire</br>Of fame immortal; &mdash; all my dreams resign'd.</br>All, all are gone:  yet turn I ne'er behind</br>Like pilgrim wending from his native land?</br>Shall I in other path such beauties find,</br>As spring beneath imagination's hand,</br>As bloom on wild enthusiasm's visionary strand?", "Celestial Genius!  dangerous gift of Heaven!</br>How many a heart and mind hast thou o'erthrown!</br>Broken the first, the last to frenzy driven,</br>Or jarr'd of both for aye the even tone!</br>Once, once I thought such fate would be my own,</br>And only look'd to find an early grave;</br>To die, as I had liv'd &mdash; my powers unknown;</br>Content, so reason  might her empire save,</br>Unseen to sink beneath oblivion's rayless wave.", "But oh!  with all thy pains, thou hast a charm</br>That nought may match within this vale below;</br>E'en for the pangs thou giv'st, thou hast a balm,</br>And renderest sweet the bitterness of wo.</br>Thy breath ethereal &mdash; thy kindling glow&mdash;</br>Thy visions bright &mdash; thy raptures, wild and high;</br>He that hath felt &mdash; Oh!  would he e'er forego?</br>No! &mdash; in thy glistening tear thy bursting sigh,</br>Though fraught with wo, there is a thrill of ecstasy!", "And art thou flown, thou high celestial power?</br>For ever flown? &mdash; Ah!  turn thee yet again!</br>Ah!  yet be with me in the lonely hour,</br>Yet stoop to guide my wilder'd fancy's rein!</br>Turn thee once more, and wake thy ancient strain;</br>No joys that earth can yield I love like thine:</br>Nay, more than earth's best joys I love thy pain.</br>And could I say, I would thy smile resign?</br>No, while this bosom beats, oh still great gift be mine!</br>"]
