["Long veil'd in Gothick mists our Britain lay,</br>E'er dawning science beam'd a cheering ray,</br>Dark monkish systems and dull senseless rhymes</br>Swell'd the vain volumes of those ruder times:</br>When Chaucer rose, the Phoebus of our isle,</br>And bid bright art on downward ages smile;</br>His genius pierc'd the gloom of error through,</br>And truth with nature rose at once to view.", "In regal courts by princely favours grac'd</br>His easy muse acquir'd her skilful taste:</br>A universal genius she displays</br>In his mixt subject tun'd to various lays.</br>If in heroic strain he tries his art,</br>All Homer's fire and strength the strains impart.</br>Is love his theme?  how soft the lays, how warm!</br>With Ovid's sweetness all his numbers charm!</br>His thoughts so delicate, so bright his flame,</br>Not just praise we owe the Roman name.</br>What pious strains the heavenly piece adorn,</br>Where guilty Magdalen is taught to mourn;</br>Devotion's charms their strongest powers combine,</br>And with the poet equals the divine.</br>When he some scene of tragic woe recites,</br>Our pity feels the strong distress he writes;</br>Like Sophocles majestic he appears,</br>And claims alike our wonder and our tears.</br>Does he to comic wit direct his aim?</br>His humour crowns th' attempt with equal fame.</br>Meer fictions for realities we take,</br>So just a picture his descriptions make;</br>So true with life his characters agree,</br>Whate'er is read we almost think we see.", "Such Chaucer was, bright mirror of his age!</br>Tho' length of years has quite obscur'd his page;</br>His stile grown obsolete, his numbers rude,</br>Scarce read, and but with labor understood.</br>Yet by fam'd modern bards new minted o'er,</br>His standard wit has oft enrich'd their store;</br>Whose Canterbury Tales could task impart</br>For Pope's and Dryden's choice-refining art;</br>And in their graceful polish let us view</br>What wealth enrich'd the mind where first they grew.</br>"]
