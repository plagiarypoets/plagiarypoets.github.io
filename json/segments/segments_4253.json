["Celestial shell, whose music might appease</br>The pangs of guilt, and ease the wretch's care;</br>O thou, whose sound is love,</br>Whose every tone delight,", "O let me hear thy voice in plaintive melody,</br>Break on the ebon silence of the night;</br>As if pois'd in air,</br>Some wand'ring angels sung.", "In her midpath sublime, the queen of night,</br>In silver majesty, from heav'n looks down,</br>And seems to stay her course</br>Awhile, to listen to thy strains.", "But ah!  that pause, and then that lengthen'd sweep,</br>Maddens my brain, and steals away my sense;</br>It sheds throughout my mind,</br>A melancholy awe.", "And wrapt in strange and pleasing phantasy,</br>I rise to heaven, and leave the world behind;</br>Forgetful of its griefs,</br>And all its cares and fears.", "Thus once play'd Orpheus, he whom poets sung,</br>Whose harp mellifluous, could unbend the frowns,</br>And soothe the rugged hearts</br>Of Pluto and his bride,", "When melting strains could ope the doors of hell,</br>To all before fast clos'd, without redress;</br>And from the realms of night,</br>Recal a wand'ring shade.", "But not e'en he, nor yet the heavenly maid,</br>Cecilia, may with thee compare, sweet shell;</br>Not with thy harmony,</br>So beautifully wild,", "Not with such strains of old, Timotheus mov'd</br>Great Alexander's breast; nor thus sang he,</br>At whose command, uprose</br>The lofty walls of Thebes.", "Thine is the prize, all else must yield to thee;</br>Thou, who dost make the very zephyrs sigh</br>In accents of despair,</br>Melodiously sweet.", "To pass so quickly by; nor stay to hear</br>Thy magic sounds, that wake the rising morn;</br>Or swell at fall of eve,</br>Or at the midnight hour.</br>"]
