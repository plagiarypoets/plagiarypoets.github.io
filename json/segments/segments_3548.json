["STREPHON.</br>Heav'n bless my Eyes!  what's this I see!</br>Damon, the Prince of Jollity,</br>With down-cast Look, and languid Air,</br>Without his Pipe, without his Care!</br>I thought, from hence a distant Way,</br>I met your little Flock astray;</br>But why unguarded and alone?</br>What have the harmless Wand'rers done!", "DAMON.</br>Ah!  Strephon, have you never seen</br>A Nymph, the fairest on the Green,</br>As strait as yonder Poplars rise,</br>With blooming Cheeks, and smiling Eyes?</br>For whom I oft', in Heat and Cold,</br>Have led the tender Flock to Fold;</br>For whom I cropt the Violet blue,</br>The Pink, and Rose of ruddy Hue;</br>And thought myself then doubly blest,</br>When she had plac'd them in her Breast.", "STREPHON.</br>Yes, Shepherd, I remember well,</br>On May-Day last, when Blowzabel,</br>With all her little Arts, assay'd</br>To win you from the beauteous Maid,</br>T' have seen the purple Current flow</br>Beneath a Skin as white as Snow,</br>T' have heard the Virgin's tender Sighs,</br>Whene'er on you she turn'd her Eyes.", "DAMON.</br>Strephon, forbear; I was to blame,</br>To teaze her with an acted Flame;</br>For Blowzabel was false I knew,</br>As false as Florimel was true;</br>Ah!  Florimel, bereft of thee,</br>What's Flocks of bleating Sheep to me!</br>With thee the Hours flew amain,</br>'Twas Morn, 'twas Night, 'twas Morn again!</br>And all a single Moment seem'd,</br>While silly We, alas!  but dream'd.", "STREPHON.</br>Unhappy Swain!  too well I guess</br>The Cause of thy Unhappiness;</br>But Death, you know, must be endur'd,</br>And Griefs the strongest may be cur'd.</br>Remember Thyrsis, how he cry'd,</br>When, late, his Rosalinda dy'd;</br>He broke his Crook, he chid his Sheep,</br>And made the stoutest Swain to weep,</br>When he related, wond'rous well,</br>What Omens did her Death foretel;</br>How little Tray a Grave had made,</br>Without the Use of Showl or Spade,</br>How oft' the Death-Watch had been heard,</br>Whose Clicking makes the Maids afeard;</br>And how the Hen, who us'd to cluck,</br>Crow'd thrice, as loud as any Cock;</br>The very Hen, that always lay</br>Upon her Apron every Day:</br>Ungrateful Hen!  and then he'd groan,</br>Sure 'twould have griev'd a Heart of Stone.</br>Where's, now, his Grief for Rosey's Charms?</br>Why, all forgot in Chloe's Arms.", "DAMON.</br>Too well I know that such there be;</br>But, Strephon, think not thus of me:</br>No never, never, be it said,</br>That Damon sought a second Bed!", "STREPHON.</br>Well, weep your fill, but make no Vows,</br>Lest, perjur'd, you again should 'Spouse:</br>Tears rather ease, than do us hurt;</br>But Vows too sacred are for Sport.</br>See Seraphina in High Life,</br>Well born, well-bred, no Shepherd's Wife,</br>Who Half so gay?  appears a Bride,</br>Where six Months since her dearest dy'd.</br>How great, how real was her Grief?</br>How vain the Task to speak Relief?</br>Who saw her Tears, that could refrain?</br>Or heard her sigh, but sigh'd again?</br>You'll say, perhaps, 'twas insincere:</br>No, Love alone drew every Tear;</br>She, rich in Tears, did, in a Day,</br>The Tribute of a Twelve-month pay.</br>A Twelve-month past, fond Custom cries,</br>Ye weeping Widows, dry your Eyes;</br>But why a Twelve-month, and no more?</br>It might as well impose a Score:</br>Meer Custom, be it good or bad,</br>Can neither merry make, nor sad:</br>The Grief-struck Heart in Tissue bleeds,</br>While merry Faces lurk in Weeds;</br>Nor best nor worst, alike are they,</br>Who mourn a Year, or mourn a Day,</br>They'll wed again their Grief's well o'er;</br>And Seraphina's done no more.", "DAMON.</br>O sooth my Woes!  or Words forbear!</br>Such Lightness but offends my Ear.</br>Six little Months!  nay barely six!</br>E'er one was cold, again to fix!</br>But she's a Woman; and the Wind</br>Is steadier far than Womankind.", "STREPHON.</br>Are Women such, why weep you then?</br>Give o'er, and act like other Men,</br>Who, in the Grave their Comfort laid,</br>Seek Comfort in some willing Maid.", "DAMON.</br>Nor was she Woman whom I wail;</br>Nor bad Example shall prevail;</br>She from her Sex distinguish'd stood,</br>Tho' fair, more fam'd for being good;</br>Their was her Form, not theirs her Mind,</br>That was no Part of Womankind!</br>I may, when such appears agen,</br>Uncensur'd, act like other Men.", "STREPHON.</br>Damon, adieu, let me advise,</br>For crying does but spoil your Eyes;</br>Resume your Pipe, collect your Sheep,</br>And to yourself your Sorrows keep;</br>For trust me, as you're Flesh and Blood,</br>You'll wed, and think the next as good.</br>"]
