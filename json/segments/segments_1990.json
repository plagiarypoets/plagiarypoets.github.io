["A gay smiling woodbine her arms spread around,</br>When by chance to an oak the young tendrils were bound.</br>This oak was no sapling:  full long had he stood,</br>And defied the rude storms that had swept thro' the wood:</br>All rough was his bark; and around might you see,</br>From his acorns upspringing, full many a tall tree;</br>Yet his foliage was green; and, erect in his pride,</br>He look'd up to the skies, and the tempest defied;</br>And he gloried the more in the vigour remain'd,</br>When he saw the gay blossom his branches sustain'd.", "She, fragrant and sportive and lovely and gay</br>As the Star of the Morn, or the Zephyrs of May,</br>With a sigh and a smile, and a glance that would fain</br>Act the semblance of coyness, and look like disdain,</br>Exclaims, \"By what magic, thou moss-menac'd tree,</br>Are the folds of my freshness thus twin'd upon thee?</br>I am young, I am blooming, in sweets I abound,</br>And gaze where I will on the forest around,</br>Elm, maple, and holm seem my favour to woo,</br>And invite my fresh bloom &mdash; wherefore lavish'd on you?</br>Bid the Fates of thy date some sage lustres retrace;</br>Or loosen my arms from this wayward embrace.\"", "He smil'd and replied (for he felt her arms twine</br>More closely around as she seem'd to repine)&mdash;</br>\"It is true that young trees in the forest abound</br>Might exult that thy tendrils should fold them around;</br>Some that tower up aloft, some that arborous spread,</br>Some that, crown'd with full blossoms, wave proudly the head;</br>And if but my merits could sue for thy grace,</br>My desolate arms must resign thy embrace.</br>But Fortune has planted thee close by my side,</br>And the wild winds of heaven thy young branches have tied,</br>By an impulse mysterious, that looks like decree:</br>Let me hope, for thy boon; for 'tis rapture to me.</br>And though I could wish, of the years have pass'd o'er me,</br>Some few, for thy sake, the kind Fates would restore me,</br>Yet has each that revolv'd to some shoot given birth,</br>That shall shelter thy sweetness, and cherish thy worth.</br>Nor has Time, that alone can experience impart,</br>Yet chill'd the warm currents should freshen the heart:</br>My boughs are not wither'd, my foliage not shed;</br>My sap is not dried, nor yet hoary my head.</br>I have stood through the tempests that, raging around,</br>Have laid many younger uptorn on the ground;</br>And my green-looking age, and the storms I withstood,</br>Prove no wild taint of youth has infected my blood.", "\"Then cling to me still; let my strength be thy stay,</br>While thy blossoms adorn me, so lovely and gay;</br>For these arms shall not shrink, nor this stem shall not bend,</br>When the hurricanes rage, or the torrents descend.</br>So &mdash; pine not, sweet tendril; but cling to the tree,</br>That grows young at thy touch, and shall flourish for thee.</br>By decay yet unsapp'd, by the tempest unbroke,</br>'Tis an oak with a heart, and a true heart of oak!\"</br>"]
