["O, welcome home with thy triumphant sail!</br>Atchiev'd the noble task to thee assign'd;</br>With ardour such as thine it scarce could fail;</br>And to thy purpose friendly ev'ry wind:</br>All mark'd thy distant tract with eager eye,</br>For 'twas the glorious cause of sweet humanity.", "To such a cause the Heav'ns protection lend!</br>Thou felt their influence in a trying hour;</br>When all around menac'd a fatal end,</br>From the black stratagems of lawless power:</br>For it was then they rais'd Hope's soothing form,</br>To cheer thy drooping heart, and calm th' impending storm.", "O, snatch'd from death! &mdash; sav'd by a hand divine,</br>To persevere 'midst terrors round thee hurl'd,</br>To tread in happier times a glorious line,</br>And scatter blessings o'er the Western World;</br>Plant the fair tree of peace, the wretched save;</br>And give mankind far more than conquest ever gave.", "What are the banners which the victor bears</br>From slaughter'd hosts stretch'd on the ensanguin'd field?</br>Wet with the orphan's and the widow's tears,</br>They to the mind no solid joy can yield;</br>The sense of fame may raise a transient glow,</br>But soon the laurel wreath shrinks with'ring from its brow!", "The leader of the Argonautic Band</br>(Though his renown a while spread half o'er Greece),</br>Who with a daring, but a plunderer's hand</br>Convey'd to Thessaly the Golden Fleece;</br>Yet short is his glory; &mdash; torn by dire alarms,</br>Nor sooth'd by love's soft power, nor bright Medea's charms.", "These are the fleeting triumphs of an hour,</br>Which one great deed of virtue far outweighs!</br>Those who for others' good exert their power,</br>On a firm base their own memorial raise.</br>Time views the trophy with a raptur'd eye,</br>And vows  it ne'er shall feel the ravage of his scythe.", "Yes, my respected friend, this trophy's thine;</br>Where with their weight of fruit thy Bread-Trees bend,</br>Afric's dark sons shall in their shade recline,</br>And to the skies thy well-earn'd praises send,</br>Their comforts share; and, conscious whence they came,</br>Teach children yet unborn to venerate thy name.", "But what eulogium's due to his good mind,</br>The virtuous Monarch of these happy isles,</br>Who first this philanthropic plan design'd,</br>To o'erspread the anxious face of care with smiles?</br>Who from his people's joy derives his own,</br>His subject's loyal hearts the bulwark of his throne!</br>"]
