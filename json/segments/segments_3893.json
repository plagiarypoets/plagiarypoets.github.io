["When bright'ning Phoebus beam'd his gentle Ray,</br>By Daphne's Side enamour'd Strephon lay:</br>The Youth, with Rapture, Nature's Sweets survey'd,</br>Thus Silence broke &mdash; and thus reply'd the Maid:", "STREPHON.</br>How pleasant this Valley &mdash; how green looks yon Grove!</br>What perfumes richly scent the new Air!</br>The Birds sweetly warble a Concert of Love!</br>And the Day seems uncommonly fair!&mdash;</br>But why should I joy at such Trifles as these,</br>Since to them no Contentment I owe?&mdash;</br>'Tis my Daphne alone has true Power to please,</br>And true Happiness gives me to know!", "DAPHNE.</br>When the Skies, in bright Azure, are beauteously drest,</br>They seem dull, if my Strephon's away;</br>And when, with black Clouds, they are heavily prest,</br>If he's present &mdash; quite charming the Day!</br>Then forgive, if I ask, (urg'd by faithfullest Love,</br>To which I submissively yield)</br>Why, when I was alone in our Cottage above,</br>Strephon wandering stray'd o'er the Field?", "STREPHON.</br>I was absent, my Fair, for yon Vale was o'erflow'd</br>By the Falling of Yesterday's Rain;</br>While at length in some Safety my Lambs I bestow'd,</br>And took Care of the Sheep on the Plain.&mdash;</br>If I ever to thee, ev'n in Thought, was untrue,</br>May I swift from thy Presence be driv'n;</br>May I ne'er, by thy Side, taste the Ev'ning's sweet Dew&mdash;</br>May thy Heart to another be giv'n!", "DAPHNE.</br>Thy Words, like soft Music, transpierce my fond Ear,</br>And, ravishing doubly my Mind,</br>Dispel from my breast ev'ry Heart-racking Fear,</br>That Strephon no longer was kind!</br>Thus, blest with thy Love, I solicit not State,</br>Nor regard Fortune's Smile, or her Frown;</br>As more piercing than Daggers would prove Strephon's Hate,</br>So his Love's of more Worth than a Crown!</br>"]
