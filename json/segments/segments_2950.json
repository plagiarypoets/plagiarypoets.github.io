["Ye lovers, so sprightly and young,</br>Whose hearts never bitterly pine,</br>Who ramble the woodlands among,</br>Enrapt with their music divine:</br>O!  list to my sorrowful lay,</br>To the tortures I'm forc'd to endure;</br>But if you won't hear what I say,</br>Why that I can't help I am sure!", "I have liv'd, but alas!  all in vain&mdash;</br>I have stuck to the fair one I chose&mdash;</br>I thought that she lov'd me again,</br>For she always kept treading my toes!</br>My body is scarlet and blue</br>With the treatment I've often receiv'd;</br>You may think the confession not true,</br>If not &mdash; I am grossly deceiv'd!", "At even when the gentle gales blow,</br>I steal to her dwelling of clay;</br>And pressing her bosom of snow,</br>Fall down on my marrows to pray:</br>To beg that she'll be friendly and kind,</br>And yield to my tender desire;</br>But she swears she was never inclin'd</br>In the arms of a bard to expire!", "I urge her to list to my strain,</br>But the devil a word will she speak;</br>I beg her to solace my pain,</br>But this to her ladyship's Greek:</br>With trouble confounded and sad</br>I pensively roam thro' the dale,</br>Then go to the cot of her dad,</br>To blubber my pitiful tale.", "I talk of my learning and wit&mdash;</br>My skill in the verse-making line,</br>I fall in a desperate fit,</br>And grumble and grunt like a swine:</br>The mother, alarm'd at my case,</br>Runs swift to the neighbouring stream;</br>Sprinkles water all over my face,</br>And thus puts an end to the dream.", "Awaken'd, as you may suppose,</br>I rush'd to the dark shady grove;</br>But, the last time, I fell on my nose,</br>Which soon put a stop to my love:</br>I call for the aid of my fair&mdash;</br>Till echo grows sick of my voice,</br>But, alas!  Dollalolla takes care</br>To turn a deaf ear to my noise.</br>"]
