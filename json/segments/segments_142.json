["What time the Sunne, with his day-labouring teames</br>Is dryving downe unto the West apace,</br>T' refresh his cauples in the Ocean streames,</br>And coole the fervor glowing in his face,</br>Which now appeares by his hie-coloured beames,</br>To rest him from our Hemisphere a space,</br>Leaving foule darknes to possesse the skies,</br>The fittest time for bloody tragedies.", "With torches now attempting the sad Cave,</br>Which at their entrance seemeth in a fright,</br>At the reflection that the brightnes gave,</br>As till that time it never saw the light,</br>Where light and darknes, with the power they have,</br>Strongly for the preheminence doe fight,</br>And each confounding other, both appeare</br>As to their owne selves they contrary were.", "The craggy cleeves which crosse them as they goe,</br>Make as theyr passage they would have denyde,</br>And threatning them their journy to forslow,</br>As angry with the path that was their guide,</br>As they their griefe, and discontent would show,</br>Cursing the hand that did first devide.</br>The combrous falls, and risings seeme to say,</br>This wicked action could not brooke the day.", "The gloomy lamps this troope still forward led,</br>Forcing the shadowes follow on their backe,</br>Are like the mourners waiting on the dead,</br>And as the deede, so are they ugly blacke;</br>Hate goes before, confusion followed,</br>The sad portents of blood-shed, and of wrack,</br>These fain dym-burning lights as all amazed,</br>At those deformed shades whereon they gazed.", "The clattering Armes their Maisters seeme to chide,</br>As they would reason wherefore they should wound,</br>And striking with the poynts from side to side,</br>As though even angry with the hollow ground</br>That it this vile and ruthlesse act should hide,</br>Whose stony roofe lock'd in their dolefull sound,</br>And hanging in the creekes, draw backe againe,</br>As willing them from murther to refraine.</br>"]
