["'Twas here that Nature to the Poet's dream</br>Gave her enchanting forms, and bless'd his Muse</br>With scenes that MOLE his proud summit views</br>Enamour'd still; where MULLA'S wizard stream,</br>With hues unborrow'd of the Solar beam,</br>In frolic dance her glittering wave pursues;</br>Or where the cold and leafless rocks accuse</br>The ear, that heard unmov'd the giant-scream</br>Of many an ancient forest, crush'd and slain.</br>'Twas here that from Lismore, with state oppress'd,</br>The Fugitive took shelter:  it was here</br>That verse could soothe Ambition's goading pain,</br>With charm inspir'd: &mdash; Historian, blot the rest!</br>And spare the Muses a degrading tear!</br>"]
