["Hush'd were the scenes around; &mdash; a slumbrous dream</br>Reign'd like the stillness of an autumn day;&mdash;</br>Each man had yielded to the tranquil sway</br>Of silent thought; &mdash; when, with a yellow gleam</br>Like that of an October morn, a stream</br>Of living fire, with supernatural ray,</br>Flow'd from the Shepherd's Pipe &mdash; one spark did seem</br>A wandering comet, ere it died away.</br>And, like that spark, my feeble morbid spirit</br>Lingers upon oblivion's dusky shore;&mdash;</br>But thou, my friend, by nature didst inherit</br>The robe that SHAKSPEARE, BURNS, and SPENSER wore!&mdash;</br>Learn to write sonnets, HOGG, and thou shalt merit</br>Applause, with deathless PETRARCH evermore!</br>"]
