["Come, Saint-eyed Health, whose open brow,</br>Is crown'd with Pleasure's vivid blooms;</br>Now with thy glowing hopes, thy wishes warm,</br>Inspire thy suppliant's soul.", "Thy eye of fire, and almost tyrian blush,</br>Give to the cheek of happy joy;</br>Mine be thy meekest look, oh Goddess, mine</br>Are unaspiring prayers.", "Now on my withering cheek,</br>The damp dead pale of sickness hangs;</br>And in my sinking eye</br>Life's lingering lustre plays.", "Ah give me back the bosom's calm delight,</br>Haste, still the throbbing nerve, the aching beat;</br>Cool my hot lip, and fan my scorching breast</br>With mild Hygeian breeze.", "Alternate, Agony, intense, severe,</br>And dull-eyed languour on my features now;</br>Their fearful changes strike,</br>And writhe my tortur'd frame.", "The sullen swinging bell &mdash; the sigh of love,</br>Alike disturb my brain, it starts to fire&mdash;</br>And now my faint sick heart</br>Scarce feels the pulse of life.", "Restore the chearful eye, the breathing bloom,</br>The lip of rosy tint, the easy smile;</br>The healthful mind that feels in every scene</br>The genuine thrill of joy.</br>"]
