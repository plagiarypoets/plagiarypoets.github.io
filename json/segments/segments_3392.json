["He came from the Plains of the East,</br>More welcome to me than the day,</br>His voice was contentment and rest,</br>His looks were the Sun's cheerful ray.", "Like the smooth stream he glided along;</br>Like its surface he shone in my eye;</br>He exceeded the Nightingale's song,</br>With him ev'ry pleasure was nigh.", "He had pass'd the gay season of youth,</br>Many years had he left me to roam;</br>Yet he swore to his honour and truth,</br>And fondly he call'd me his home.", "More mild than the summer's soft breeze,</br>He bid me repose on his breast;</br>There he promis'd me rapture and ease,</br>And that zephyrs shou'd fan me to rest.", "He compar'd me to Mexico's ore,</br>Vow'd his love had increas'd with his years;</br>But he breaks ev'ry oath he has swore,</br>He leaves me to anguish and tears.", "He remembers no more how I've lov'd,</br>How anxious I wish'd his return;</br>How in youth he was all I approv'd,</br>Nor how bitterly now I must mourn.", "The inconstant, whose falsehood I sing,</br>By honour nor pity is bound;</br>He knows not how sorrow can sting,</br>He feels not ingratitude's wound.", "Yet sure, when he sees me laid low,</br>When he hears how for him I have sigh'd,</br>His heart will regret the fell blow</br>By which a fond woman has died.</br>"]
