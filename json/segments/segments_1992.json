["'Twas gentle eve, and from Queen Mary's bower</br>Sweet sounds were swelling to the purple skies,</br>Winged with the breath of many a weeping flower,</br>On which the sun laid its enamoured dyes;</br>And with the music murmured lowly sight,</br>Telling a noble spirit all undone</br>By the consuming fire of Beauty's eyes&mdash;</br>Whose is the heart that music hath not won!</br>Thine, Mary, all was given to that wild witching tone.", "How little deemest thou, Mary, on that eve</br>When passion deepened on thy cheek the rose,</br>Of the dark web that traitorous art should weave,</br>The iron feud, the deadly dungeon-close!</br>Or of the minstrel's pang the dread repose,</br>When Frenzy came his matchless hand to mar!</br>Yet still in lovers' thoughts thy memory glows,</br>And Beauty sighs the strain, young Chatelar,</br>That witched Queen Mary's heart beneath the twilight star&mdash;", "I.</br>Come sweet lute, and sadly tell</br>What my tongue dared never speak;</br>Like my heart with sorrow swell,</br>Like it, then, be hushed, and break!</br>Tyrant Love!  thy weary slave</br>Finds no refuge but the grave.", "II.</br>List to me, thou fragrant wind!</br>Thou my true-love tale shalt bear;</br>In my Lady's tresses twined,</br>Fondly whisper in her ear,</br>That of all who round her rove,</br>None, like me, can die for love.", "III.</br>Now the Christian cross I wear,</br>Welcome now the angry sea;</br>Welcome Moslem shaft and spear;</br>Welcome death in Galilee.</br>Death than sorrow is dearer far&mdash;</br>Now farewell, love, lute, and star!</br>"]
