["Go, FLOWER, shew my LOVE I fear'd</br>A stem like thine could ne'er restrain,</br>Singly, so weak, so unprepar'd,</br>The driving wind, the beating rain:</br>And say, that hence a stronger reed</br>I stationed at thy friendless side,</br>A guardian band round each convey'd,</br>And both in happy union ty'd:</br>That wedded thus, safe could thy gentle form</br>Pour forth its op'ning sweets, and mock the coming storm.", "Thus, sweet Ambassadress, from me,</br>Thus, beauteous Flower, bespeak the fair,</br>And if she should the moral see,</br>&mdash;For more is meant than meets the ear&mdash;</br>And if thou mark a truant smile</br>Quick o'er her brightening features fly;</br>And if a vivid gleam the while</br>Fire the blue lustre of her eye,</br>Ah then, thou loveliest Flower!  kind, faithful be,</br>And bear one fond, one warm, one trembling vow from me!</br>"]
