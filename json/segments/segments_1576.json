["A vine from noblest lineage sprung,</br>And with the choicest clusters hung,</br>In purple rob'd, reclining lay,</br>And catch'd the fervid noon-tide ray:</br>The num'rous plants that deck the field</br>Did all the palm of beauty yield,</br>Pronounced her fairest of their train,</br>And hail'd her Empress of the Plain.", "A neigh'bring Oak, whose spiry height</br>In low-hung clouds was hid from sight,</br>Who dar'd the winds in all their forms,</br>And brav'd a thousand howling storms;</br>Conscious of worth, sublimely stood</br>The pride and glory of the wood.", "He saw the Vine defenceless lay,</br>To each invading foe a prey,</br>And wish'd to clasp her in his arms,</br>And bear her far away from harms.</br>'Twas love &mdash; 'twas tenderness &mdash;'twas all</br>That men the \"thrilling passion\" call.", "He urg'd his suit, but urg'd in vain;</br>The Vine, regardless of his pain,</br>Still flirted with each flippant green,</br>With seeing pleas'd and being seen;</br>And as the syren Flattery sang,</br>Would o'er the strain extatic hang,</br>Enjoy'd the minutes as they rose,</br>Nor fears her bosom discompose.", "But now the boding clouds arise,</br>And scowling darkness vails the skies:</br>Harsh thunders roar &mdash; red lightnings gleam,</br>And rushing torrents close the scene.", "The fawning adulating crowd,</br>Who late in thronged circles bow'd,</br>Now left their mistress of a day</br>To the o'erwhelming flood a prey;</br>Which, swell'd a deluge, pour'd around,</br>And tore her helpless from the ground:</br>Her rifled foliage floated wide,</br>And ruby Nectar ting'd the tide.", "With eager eyes, and heart dismay'd,</br>She look'd, but look'd in vain for aid:</br>\"And are my lovers fled,\" she cry'd,</br>\"Who at my feet this morning sigh'd,</br>And swore my reign would never end,</br>While youth and beauty had a friend?</br>I am unhappy, who believ'd!</br>And they detested, who deceiv'd!</br>Curse on that whim call'd maiden pride,</br>Which made me shun the name of bride,</br>When yonder Oak confess'd his flame,</br>And woo'd me in fair Honour's name.</br>&mdash;But now repentance comes too late,</br>And all forlorn I meet my fate.\"", "The Oak, who safely wav'd above,</br>Look'd down once more with eyes of love;</br>Declar'd her coldness might suspend</br>But not his gen'rous passion end:</br>Begg'd to renew his am'rous plea&mdash;</br>&mdash;As warm for union now as he,</br>To his embraces quick she flew,</br>And felt and gave sensations new.", "Enrich'd and grac'd by the sweet prize,</br>He lifts her tendrils to the skies;</br>Whilst she, protected and carest,</br>Sinks in his arms, completely blest.</br>"]
