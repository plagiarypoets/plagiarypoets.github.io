["The Vesper bell has toll'd for evening prayer,</br>As on yon Gothic arch the Moonlight sleeps,</br>A solemn requiem fills the tranquil air,</br>While in her cell the Child of Sorrow weeps.", "Slow through each gloomy grate and cloister drear,</br>Wrapt in the veil of  Penitence, I go,</br>My cheek e'er humid with Contrition's tear,</br>A tear Reflection e'er will teach to flow.", "Low at this sacred shrine I fervent kneel,</br>There pour the votive prayer and deep-drown'd sigh:</br>Yet this sad heart no rhapsody can feel,</br>And Hope ne'er animates my languid eye.", "The choral hymn, with soft seraphic strain,</br>Inspires each heart with energy divine,</br>As solemn echo through this Gothic fane</br>Resounds each vesper breath'd at Virtue's shrine.", "The lamp of Hope extinguish'd in my breast,</br>The thorn of keen Remorse too refug'd there,</br>Lost to the World! &mdash; by Sorrow deep opprest,</br>Fate points me out the victim of Despair.", "Yet, as the lingering sparks of Life decay,</br>And the last tear of contrite Sorrow flows,</br>May one faint gleam from Mercy's glowing ray</br>Gild the sad scenes tht close the sufferer's woes!</br>"]
