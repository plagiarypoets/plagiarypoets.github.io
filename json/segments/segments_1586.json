["Bard of the North!  abandon not the Lyre,</br>Whose strains, so sweetly wild, thy skilful hand</br>Has taught surrounding nations to admire</br>Beyond the sleight of all Cecilia's band:</br>Ne'er shall the wires, by casual breezes fann'd,</br>Vibrate in harmony more rich than thine;</br>Nor artist e'er be found in all the land,</br>Like thee the dregs of fiction to refine</br>By inspiration's blast, and fancy's flame divine.", "When malice shall again invade thy breast,</br>Misfortune sieze thee in her rude embrace;</br>Sorrow disturb the chamber of thy rest,</br>Or envy spread her snares for thy disgrace;</br>What charm shall then embolden thee to face</br>Th' impending shock, if thou the strain forego?</br>Or from thy memory's crowded page erase</br>The records manifold of former wo,</br>And all the countless pangs that none but poets know?", "There was a time, in numbers, though uncouth,</br>When I could cheer the solitary hour;</br>But ere I reach'd the joyous prime of youth,</br>A fiend of ghastly form, and giant power,</br>Intruder oft upon the muses' bower,</br>Dash'd from my feeble grasp the sounding shell;</br>My fancy from the heights she wont to tower</br>Drove headlong downward; and by magic spell</br>Bound her to furnish sport for every imp of hell:", "The fairy visions opening to her view</br>They scatter'd to the winds, and mock'd my pain;</br>And though her labour she would oft renew</br>'Twas worthless skill, and labour all in vain;</br>Yet never could she from the task refrain:&mdash;</br>From thine, alas!  how different is my fate!</br>Thou leav'st the muse, though fame applauds thy strain;</br>While I, though grovelling in obscure estate,</br>Pursue her still in spite of more than mortal hate.</br>"]
