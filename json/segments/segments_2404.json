["When the fam'd Ruler after God's own heart</br>Had his full course of days and glory run,</br>'Twas Heaven's decree the sceptre to impart</br>Of Israel's chosen race to Solomon:</br>Call'd from his birth by Him whose word is Truth;</br>And for his father's sake God lov'd the royal youth.", "And think what gift, what blessing thou would'st ask;</br>But name thy wish, and it is freely thine:&mdash;</br>My weakness sinks beneath this empire's task;</br>Birth may give kingdoms, wisdom is divine:</br>Wisdom to rule I make my sole request;</br>Be this my only bliss to make my people blest.", "'Tis given, He answer'd, what my Son requires;</br>Thy wish comes after my consenting will:</br>My influence first gave birth to thy desires;</br>I dictate the request, and then fulfil.</br>Here who pursues, already holds the prize;</br>For Wisdom's greatest part is, wishing to be wise.", "And still the fabrick of thy state to raise,</br>The gifts thy virtue asks not, I bestow:</br>I crown thee with a length of prosperous days;</br>Full at thy feet the golden tide shall flow;</br>O'er the wide world thy empire shall extend;</br>And with this stedfast earth thy name and glory end.", "This scene display'd in Israel's ancient days,</br>Repeated now with rapture we behold;</br>A Sovereign young, yet vers'd in Wisdom's ways;</br>Mature in virtue, and in prudence old;</br>Peace, he discerns, is the first care of kings,</br>Tho' every gale that blows bears victory on it's wings.", "One only point of difference can be shown,</br>Which may decide this honourable strife</br>Between the Jewish Monarch and our own,</br>Mark'd in the conduct of their private life.</br>True joys of love none but chaste bosoms  know,</br>The bliss unlink'd with Shame, and unpursu'd by Woe.</br>"]
