["Now gaping lacqueys wait their masters knock,</br>And with impatience hear the chearful cock;</br>Sleep now, still reigning monarch, lulls the scene,</br>From Hyde-Park Corner down the Mile-End Green:</br>Some lovers only count the tedious time,</br>And sing sad ditties in much sadder rhyme:</br>Theatrick heroes now of empire dream,</br>And mimick Damon sighs beside some purling stream:</br>One furls, or dreams she furls, a new-bought fan,</br>And fancy to fifteen presents a man:</br>Coy maids at fifty curse the fatal willow,</br>Whilst crowds of beaus are rival'd by their pillow:</br>Eas'd of his money, home each gamester steers,</br>And every tavern-wicket clos'd appears:</br>Each Black-shoe's stretch'd upon his well-known block,</br>And shivering watchmen cry \"past three o'clock\":</br>Cards laid aside, and company all gone,</br>Chloe and Betty now were left alone;</br>When thus the nymph, in easy chair reclin'd,</br>Whilst Betty waited her command behind.</br>With many an aukward pretty yawn exprest</br>These airy notions lab'ring in her breast:</br>Of all those arts in which our sex excel,</br>The chief the prettiest is coquetting well;</br>That art by which mankind our souls are made,</br>Which baffles all their reason's boasted aid.</br>Happy the nymph, who knows her charms to prize,</br>Who with unmeaning softness rolls her eyes,</br>Whilst at each turn some foolish gazer dies.</br>How vain, and how fantastical is man,</br>Dependent on the cracking of a fan!</br>I love to see the creature rave and stare,</br>To me 'tis perfect comedy, I swear.</br>Berhym'd all o'er by many a love-sick swain,</br>Whilst crowds unnumber'd gladly fill my train,</br>Insensible to all alike I give</br>My charms, whilst they by my permission live:</br>Each takes his turn; now Sylvio, Daphnis woos,</br>One sighs in metre, on in billetdeux;</br>I take them all, the prose perhaps I tear,</br>But keep the poetry &mdash; to curl my hair&mdash;</br>Here, Betty, take my cap &mdash; ha &mdash; how you move!</br>I hope you don't pretend to be in love&mdash;</br>No, really maem, I know much better things,</br>'Tis only fit for girls in leading-strings;</br>I hope, maem, I have never giv'n you cause</br>To think I was (here Betty made a pause&mdash;</br>For Bellmour's footman Thomas, you must know,</br>Had struck the wench's fancy long ago;</br>Cou'd hum a tune or two, talk smart and witty,</br>And swore her mistress was not half so pretty.)</br>True (she proceeds) Tom, when he brings you letters,</br>Will tell me I'm as handsome as my betters;</br>Yet does it follow I must love the fop?</br>Here Chloe gap'd, and Betty made a stop.</br>Chloe had hitherto with patience heard</br>Her chattering maid, nor answer'd her a word;</br>At looking-glass engag'd, she smiles, she stares,</br>And 'gainst to-morrow practices new airs.</br>Betty enrag'd at breath so thrown away,</br>Restraint no longer on her tongue cou'd lay;</br>But thus proceeds:  I cannot, for my soul,</br>See the great harm in love upon the whole;</br>Nay, and I know some folks, for all their railing,</br>Who sometimes may be caught, like others, failing;</br>Last night when Bellmour look'd on lady Grace,</br>How flush'd the colour in some people's face!</br>\"This table &mdash; how it stands &mdash; well, 'tis no wonder,</br>Thomas that fool must always have his blunder;</br>Here, Betty, take this candlestick away,</br>I'm crouded so I scarce have room to play:</br>This chair too &mdash; is &mdash; how aukwardly it stands&mdash;</br>Did ever mortal hold such wretched hands?\"</br>These words, in pretty mimickry exprest,</br>Awak'd the woman in her mistress' breast;</br>When up she starts &mdash; cease, hold your saucy prate,</br>To name the creature whom you know I hate;</br>Bellmour, that silly, vain, that ugly creature,</br>To hear him mention'd shocks my very nature&mdash;</br>Was ever mortal curs'd with such a maid&mdash;</br>You saucy hussey you &mdash; no more she said,</br>But in a passion flounces into bed.</br>Affrighted Betty dar'd to speak no more,</br>But tuck'd her up, stole off, and shut the door.</br>"]
