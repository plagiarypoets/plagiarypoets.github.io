["THE FIRST SECTION.</br>Psyche this while wandred the world about</br>With various errors to find Cupid out,</br>Hoping, although no matrimoniall way,</br>Or Beauties force his anger might allay;</br>Yet Prayers, and duty somewhat might abate,</br>And humble Service him propitiate.</br>She travell'd forth, untill at length she found</br>A pleasant plaine, with a faire Temple crown'd.</br>Then to her selfe she said, ah who can tell,</br>Whether or no, my husband there doe dwell?</br>And with this thought she goes directly on,</br>Led with blind hope, and with Devotion:</br>Then entred in, she to the Altar bended,</br>And there perform'd her Orizons:  which ended,</br>Casting her eyes about, she did espy,</br>A world of instruments for husbandry:</br>As Forkes, and Hookes, and Rakes, Sickles, and Sithes,</br>Garlands, and Sheares, and Corne for Sacrifice.</br>Those eares, that were confused, she did sever,</br>And those, that scatter'd lay, she put together;</br>Thinking, she ought no worship to decline</br>Of any thing, that seem'd to be Divine.</br>Ceres farre oft did Psyche over looke,</br>When this laborious taske she undertooke,</br>And as she is a Goddesse, that does love</br>Industrious people, spake to her from above;</br>Alas poore Psyche, Venus is thy foe,</br>And strives to find thee out with more a doe,</br>Then I my Proserpine; the Earth, the Sea,</br>And the hid confines of the Night and Day,</br>Have all beene ransackt; she has sought thee forth,</br>Through both the Poles, and Mantions of the North,</br>Not the Riphean snow, nor all the drougth,</br>That parches the vast desarts of the south,</br>Have stay'd her steps.  She has made Tethis sweepe,</br>To find thee out, the bottome of the deepe,</br>And vowes that Heaven it selfe shall thee resigne,</br>Though Jove had fixt thee, there his concubine.</br>She never rests, for since she went to bed,</br>The Rosie Crowne is wither'd from her head:</br>Thou carelesse wretch.  Thus Venus all enrag'd,</br>Seekes for thy life, whilst thou art heere ingag'd</br>'Bout my affaires, and thinkst of nothing lesse,</br>Then thine owne safety, and lost happinesse.</br>Psyche fell prostrate on her face, before</br>Faire Ceres throne, and did her helpe implore,</br>Moystning the Earth with teares, and with her haire</br>Brushing the ground; she sent up many a Prayer,</br>By thy fruit-scattering hand, I thee entreate,</br>And the Sicilian Feilds, that are the seat</br>Of thy fertility, and by the glad,</br>And happy ends, the harvest ever had;</br>And by thy coach, with winged Dragons drawne,</br>And by the darkesome hell, that gan to dawne</br>At the bright marriage of faire Proserpine:</br>And by the silent rites of Elusine,</br>Impart some pitty, and vouchsafe to grant</br>This small request, to your poore supplyant.</br>I may lye hid among these sheaves of Corne,</br>Untill great Venus fury be out-worne;</br>Or that my strength, and faculties subdu'd</br>By weary toyle, a little be renew'd.</br>But as the worlds accustom'd, when they see,</br>Any orewhelm'd with a deepe misery,</br>Afford small comfort to their wretched state;</br>But onely are in words compassionate.</br>So Ceres told her, she did greatly grieve</br>At her distresse, but durst her not releive;</br>For Venus was a good, and gratious Queene,</br>And she her favour highly did esteeme.</br>Nor would she succour a contrary side,</br>Being by love, and kin to her ally'd.</br>Poore Psyche thus repuls'd, soone as she saw</br>Her hopes quite frustrate, did her selfe withdraw,</br>And journied on, unto a neighbouring wood,</br>Where likewise a rich Fane, and Temple stood,</br>Of goodly structure, and before the house,</br>Hung many gifts, and garments pretious,</br>That by the name engrav'd, and dedication,</br>Exprest without, to whom they had relation.</br>Here Psyche enterd, her low knees did bend,</br>And both her selfe, and fortunes recommend</br>To mighty Juno, and thus spake to her.</br>Thou wife, and sister to the thunderer,</br>Whether thou dost in ancient Samos lye,</br>The place of thy first birth, and nursery.</br>Or by the bankes of Inacus abide,</br>Or thy lov'd Carthage, or round Heaven dost ride</br>Upon a Lyons backe; that art i'th East</br>Call'd Zigia, and Lucina in the west;</br>Looke on my griefes extremity, and deigne</br>To ease me, of my labour, and my paine.</br>Thus having prayed, straight Juno from on high,</br>Presents her selfe in all her Majesty,</br>And said, Psyche I wish you had your ends,</br>And that my Daughter, and your selfe were friends:</br>For Venus I have ever held most deare,</br>In as high place, as she my daughter were:</br>Nor can that, which one Goddesse has begun,</br>By any other Deity b' undone,</br>Besides the Stigian lawes allow no leave,</br>That we anothers Servant should receive;</br>Nor can we by the league of friendship, give</br>Reliefe to one, that is a fugitive.</br>Faire Psyche shipwrackt in her hopes againe,</br>And finding no wayes, how she might obtaine</br>Her winged husband, cast the worst of all;</br>And thus her thoughts did into question call:</br>What meanes can be attempted, or apply'd</br>To this my strange calamity, beside</br>What is already us'd?

 and rather,</br>What I cannot deferre, nor long withstand,</br>Yeeld up my selfe a prisoner to her hand.</br>For timely modesty may mitigate</br>That rage, which absence does exasperate.</br>And to confirme this, who knows, whether he,</br>Whom my soule longs for, with his Mother be?</br>Venus now sicke of earthly businesse,</br>Commands her Coach be put in readinesse:</br>Whose subtile structure was all wrought upon,</br>With gold, with purple, and Vermilion.</br>Vulcan compos'd the fabrick, 'twas the same</br>He gave his wife, when he a woing came.</br>Then of those many hundred Doves, that soare</br>About her palace, she selected foure,</br>Whose checkred necks to the small traces ty'd,</br>With nimble gyres they up to Heaven did glide:</br>A world of sparrows did by Venus fly,</br>And Nightingales, that sung melodiously.</br>And other birds accompany'd her Coach,</br>With pleasant noise, proclaiming her approach:</br>For neither hardy Eagle, Hawke, nor Kite,</br>Durst her sweet sounding family affright.</br>The clouds gave way, and Heaven was open made,</br>Whilst Venus, Joves high Turrets did invade.</br>Then having silenc'd her obstreperous quire,</br>She boldly calls for Mercury the cryer,</br>Joves messenger, who but a while before</br>Return'd with a loose arrant, which he bore</br>To a new Mistresse, and was now t' advise</br>Upon some tricke, to hide from Juno's eyes</br>Joves bawderie, for he such feats can doe,</br>Which are his vertues, and his office to.</br>When Venus saw him, she much joy did show,</br>And said, kind brother Mercury, you know,</br>How I esteeme your love, at no small rate,</br>With whom my minde I still communicate:</br>Without whose counsell I have nothing done,</br>But still preferr'd your admonition.</br>And now you must assist me; ther's a mayd</br>Lyes hid, whom I have long time fought, and layd</br>Close waite to apprehend, but cannot take;</br>Therefore I'de have you proclamation make,</br>With a reward propounded, to requite,</br>Who e're shall bring, and set her in my sight.</br>Make knowne her markes, and age, lest any chance,</br>Or after dare to pretend ignorance.</br>Thus having said, she gave to him a note,</br>And libell, wherein Psyches name was wrote.</br>Hermes the powerfull, and all charming god</br>Taking in hand his soule constraining rod,</br>With which he carries, and brings backe from hell,</br>With Venus went, for he lov'd Venus well;</br>Cause he in former time her love had wonne,</br>And in his dalliance, had of her sonne</br>Begot, call'd the Hermaphrodite, which is</br>The Boy, that was belov'd by Salmacis.</br>Thus both from Heaven descended, open cry</br>In expresse words, was made by Mercury,", "O yes, if any can true tidings bring</br>Of Venus hand-maid, daughter to a King,</br>Psyche the fugitive, of stature tall,</br>Of tender age, and forme celestiall:</br>To whom, for dowry, Art, and Nature gave</br>All grace, and all the comlinesse they have.</br>This I was bid to say, and be it spoken</br>Without all envy, each smile is a token</br>Sufficient to betray her.  In her gate</br>She Phoebus sister does most imitate.</br>Nor does her voyce sound mortall; if you spy</br>Her face, you may discerne her by the eye,</br>That like a starre, dazels the Optick sense,</br>Cupid has oft his Torch brought lighted thence.</br>If any finde her out, let him repaire</br>Straight wayes to Mercury, and the newes declare;</br>And for his recompence, he shall have leave,</br>Even from Venus owne lips, to receive</br>Seven fragrant kisses, and the rest among,</br>One honey-kisse, and one touch from her tongue.", "Which being published, the great desire</br>Of this reward, set all mens hearts on fire.</br>So that poore Psyche durst no more forbeare</br>To offer up her selfe:  then drawing neare</br>To Venus house, a Maid of hers, by name</br>Call'd Custome, when she saw her, did exclaime,</br>O Madam Psyche, Jove your honour save:</br>What doe you feele now, you a Mistresse have?</br>Or does your rashnesse, or your ignorant worth</br>Not know, the paines we tooke to find you forth?</br>Sweet, you shall for your stubbornesse be taught:</br>With that, rude hold upon her locks she caught,</br>And drag'd her in, and before Venus brought.", "THE SECOND SECTION.</br>So soone as Venus saw her, she like one,</br>That looks 'twixt scorne, and indignation,</br>Rais'd a loud laughter, such as does proceed</br>From one, that is vext furiously indeed.</br>Then shaking of her head, biting her thumb,</br>She sayd, what my good daughter are you come</br>Your Mother to salute?
