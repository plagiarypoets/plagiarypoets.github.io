["In a chariot of light from the regions of day,</br>The goddess of Liberty came;</br>Ten thousand celestials directed the way,</br>And hither conducted the dame.</br>A fair budding branch from the gardens above,</br>Where millions with millions agree,</br>She brought in her hand, as a pledge of her love,</br>And the plant she named Liberty Tree.", "The celestial exotic struck deep in the ground,</br>Like a native it flourish'd and bore,</br>The fame of its fruit drew the nations around,</br>To seek out this peaceable shore.</br>Unmindful of names or distinctions they came,</br>For freemen like brothers agree,</br>With one spirit endued, they one Friendship pursued,</br>And their temple was Liberty tree.", "Beneath this fair tree, like the patriarchs of old,</br>Their bread in contentment they eat,</br>Unvex'd with the troubles of silver and gold,</br>The cares of the grand and the great.</br>With timber and tar they Old England supply'd,</br>And supported her power on the sea;</br>Her battles they fought, without getting a groat,</br>For the honour of Liberty tree.", "But hear, O ye swains, ('tis a tale most profane,)</br>How all the tyrannical powers,</br>King, Commons, and Lords, are uniting amain</br>To cut down this guardian of ours;</br>From the east to the west, blow the trumpet to arms,</br>Thro' the land let the sound of it flee,</br>Let the far and the near, &mdash; all unite with a cheer,</br>In defence of our Liberty tree.</br>"]
