["Ah!  doubt not, my Delia, thy Damon's return,</br>Tho' fate thus commands us to part,</br>In my breast the soft passion for ever shall burn,</br>And thy image still twine round my heart.", "The remembrance of scenes, so late my delight,</br>And the haunts where we used to rove,</br>The cloud topping hill, or the dale blooming bright,</br>Or the cooling recess of the grove.", "These, these shall my memory ever retain,</br>And its joys in fair numbers rehearse,</br>My muse shall assist the glad task of my pen,</br>And gratitude swell the sad verse.", "Tho' lost to my sight, still the same is my love,</br>Which no period of time can erase;</br>Neither absence, nor time, can my passion remove,</br>Nor aught my affections efface.</br>"]
