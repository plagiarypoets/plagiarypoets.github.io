["Oh, hallowed heart, and dignity of worth,&mdash;</br>Immortal PAGET!  thy full fame is now</br>Fixed firm for ever: &mdash; thy fierce wars brought forth</br>No blossom like to this: &mdash; thy soldier brow,</br>Though brave, was like the many.  But the flow</br>Of thy heart's best affections wins for thee</br>What battle's carnage ne'er could gain below,</br>The overflowing blessing that comes free,</br>And glorifies a name which mourns for misery.", "All hail, unsullied One! &mdash; e'en while the stream</br>Of Erin's blood runs quickly, shall be dear</br>Thy memory to her offspring:  as a beam</br>Of light on darkness, has thy generous tear</br>Fallen on her varied woes.  'Tis to revere</br>And love thy name, a hapless land shall smile:</br>If it may be allowed thus much to wear,</br>Unenvied by the factions, who revile</br>And trample on the rights of a poor, wretched Isle.", "Oh, future years of Fate! &mdash; remember Him</br>In the far stretch of Fame's eternity!</br>When war's red page shall read more faint and dim,</br>Let this most gentle fame the brightest be,</br>And let it feed on Ages.  Liberty</br>At length shall wake its strength, and that fair day,</br>When Erin shall be heard, &mdash; and ANGLESEY</br>Shall live in her fond records, &mdash; as a ray,</br>Amongst her First and Dearest, &mdash; never to decay!</br>"]
