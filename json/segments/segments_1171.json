["'Tis General Nature, in thy art and mine,</br>Must give our fame in future times to shine:</br>Sublime and pathos, like the Sun's fix'd flame,</br>Remain, and please thro' every age the same;</br>Humour's light shapes, like vapours in the sky,</br>Rise, pass, and vary, and for ever fly:</br>HOGARTH and SWIFT, if living, might deplore</br>Half their keen jokes, that now are jokes no more.", "What Truth's rich page of real event supplies,</br>What Fancy's powers of fabled act devise,</br>Before the lie &mdash; but where the field so wide,</br>There Judgment's hand Selection's step must guide.", "To Horror's forms the mind aversion feels,</br>To SPANIOLET'S slay'd saints and torturing wheels;</br>Nor praise for nauseous images we win,</br>For SPENSER's Error, or for MILTON's Sin...</br>"]
