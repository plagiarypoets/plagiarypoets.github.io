["Hail thou smiling, blooming Maid,</br>In all the flow'rs of spring array'd:</br>On thee all the Graces wait,</br>And compose thy comely gait.</br>Youth is ever by thy side,</br>Clad in robes of strength and pride:</br>Beauty mingles in thy train,</br>Holding myriads in her chain:</br>Mirth and Joy thee dance around,</br>With verdant boughs and garlands crown'd.", "At morn thou lov'st the dewy fields,</br>Where Nature freshest fragrance yields:</br>The blushing rose then sweetest smells;</br>Then daily gayest paints the dells;</br>The lark then sweetest tunes her song</br>Earliest of the feather'd throng,</br>Cheering shepherd as he goes,</br>To let loose his bleating ewes.</br>At noon thou lov'st the cool retreat,</br>Shaded from the scorching heat;</br>Where the western breezes blow,</br>And the crystal fountains flow.</br>When Ev'ning comes in robes of gray,</br>Or Phoebe throws her silver ray,</br>Thou lov'st to walk in flow'ry mead,</br>Or by the silent stream to tread;</br>List'ning, thoughtful, to the tale</br>Of the plainful nightingale:</br>When thou view'st the vaulted skies,</br>Glowing rapture fills thy eyes;</br>Orbs unnumber'd glide along,</br>Hymning in a sacred throng.", "HEALTH, with thee I mean to live,</br>Since thou only joy canst give:</br>And, without thee, what is life,</br>Toss'd in scenes of grief and strife?</br>Hence Disease, and Pain, and Folly,</br>Sadness sour, and Melancholy:&mdash;</br>Back to your Tartarian cell,</br>There in darkness deep to dwell;</br>There the slow-pac'd hours to waste,</br>In pining fits, and sick distaste.</br>Come ye Laughs, and Jests, and Smiles,</br>And festive Sport that time beguiles,</br>Lead me to Hygeia's bow'r,</br>Deck'd with ev'ry blooming flow'r,</br>Where the pinks and lilies grow,</br>And their sweetest odours throw:</br>Where the orange and the vine</br>Their loaded branches thick entwine;</br>Fast beside a myrtle grove,</br>Where the little Cupids rove,</br>Shooting arrows, casting darts</br>At the gay and youthful hearts;</br>Where the tender feelings move</br>That feed the flames of purest love.</br>Here I'd spend the night and day,</br>And never from thy dwelling stray:</br>Tasting comfort here, and joy,</br>In thy bow'r, without alloy.</br>"]
