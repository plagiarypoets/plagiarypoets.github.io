["To climes that doze in gloom of night,</br>Lo Phoebus bends his steady rein,</br>And now he quits the mountain's height,</br>Now dips into the main:</br>Round him he scatters the last smiles of day,</br>And steals with lessening light his golden orb away.", "Farewell, resign'd to worlds below,</br>Whence Indians hail thy wish'd return,</br>And sea-born breezes whisp'ring blow,</br>To wake the rosy Morn;</br>For us even sombre Night has pleasing charms,</br>And Slumber lulls to rest, and Care with-holds her harms.", "Involv'd in robes of dusky brown</br>Now darkness mounts the steep of heav'n,</br>And black around her awful throne,</br>The scowling clouds are driven.</br>Silence succeeds; save where the chiming song</br>Of babling brook is heard the moss-grown stones among.", "And lo!  from yonder loanly tower,</br>With woeful note, and hideous cry,</br>The owl laments in woodbine-bower,</br>A foe to light and joy:</br>While Philomel, in sylvan shade retir'd,</br>Warbles her matchless song, thro' every age admir'd.", "Now, at the silent hour of night,</br>Wide o'er the woodland let me rove,</br>Beneath pale Cynthia's placid light,</br>Or through the glimmering grove.</br>No ghastly dread my careless heart invades,</br>While rapt in musings sweet along the moon-light-glades.", "Spectres and apparitions drear,</br>Where groaning church-yards heaving rise,</br>Their grisly forms horrific rear,</br>To Fear's believing eyes.</br>But o'er the mind let manly Reason reign,</br>Night shelters no such harms thro' all her dark domain.", "And now from cave where Silence dwells,</br>From couch where lazy Sloth resides,</br>From ivy-bowers, and hermit-cells,</br>And vales where Lethe glides,</br>Night calls her offspring Sleep with soft command,</br>And bids him shed his dews o'er Britain's happy land.", "The power obeys, and steers his way,</br>Dispensing slumbers as he flies;</br>Around him dreams in myriads play,</br>With wings of changeful dyes:</br>Some to fair Virtue spread the painted plume,</br>And some to Guilt unfold the horrors of the tomb.", "From princely domes of costly state,</br>Where Care drives slumber from their eyes,</br>And weary nights afflict the great,</br>Sleep disappointed flies:</br>Glad he forsakes Ambition's gilded towers,</br>For peasant's strawy bed, and peace-frequented bowers.", "In yonder humble cot the swain,</br>Sweet Compensation's pleasure knows,</br>And all his labour, all his pain,</br>Endear his soft repose.</br>Chearful he toils the day, and smiles at Care,</br>Then hies him to his couch, and sleeps contented there.", "Thus grant me, Heaven, a life serene,</br>Still urging on some fair design,</br>No buskin'd strutter on the scene,</br>Nor covetous to shine!</br>Let useful Labour  close my transient days,</br>If Conscience self approve, not proud of other praise.</br>"]
