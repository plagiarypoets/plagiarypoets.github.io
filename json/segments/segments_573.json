["As oft on Camus rushy turf reclin'd,</br>I joy'd to trace old Spenser's mystic page;</br>And fed with fancy's feast my musing mind,</br>A feast that could delight Eliza's age.", "Much would I grieve, that o'er a page so pure,</br>All-envying time had cast his dim disguise;</br>As April show'rs, by gloomy fits, obscure</br>The noon-tide radiance of the smiling skies.", "Lo!  Warton came &mdash; from every fretted tale</br>To clear the rust that canker'd all around;</br>His skilful hand unlocks each fairy vale,</br>And opes each flow'ry forest's magic bound.", "Thus never knight advent'rous dar'd invade,</br>Of Busyrane th' impervious castle drear;</br>Till Britomart each secret bow'r display'd,</br>And burst the mighty spell with golden spear.", "Th' heroic maid with haughty step explor'd</br>Each room array'd in glorious imag'ry,</br>And thro' th' enchanted chamber richly stor'd,</br>Saw Cupid's stately maske come sweeping by.", "At this (where'er by pearl-pav'd fount, I ween,</br>They rove at large amid the myrtle rows;)</br>Reviving Una lifts her princely mien,</br>And Florimel's fair wreath more freshly glows.", "At this, long drooping in forlorn despair,</br>Her painted wings Imagination plumes,</br>Pleas'd that her page, by Warton's classic care,</br>Its native charm, and genuine grace resumes.</br>"]
