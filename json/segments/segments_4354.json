["As careless I cross'd the green mead,</br>My heart free from care and from pain,</br>Kind fancy (not will) took the lead,</br>And led to the end of a plain,</br>Where a grotto there stood in the mid</br>Of a shady and cool tufted grove,</br>Where virtue from vice might be hid,</br>And all seem'd to be sacred to love.", "Enraptur'd I gaz'd all around,</br>My feet had not power to move;</br>So soften'd, no wonder I found</br>My heart was inclined to love;</br>For the goddess of this charming place,</br>Tho' not Venus, the Cyprian queen,</br>Had (without her coquetry) her grace,</br>And with virtue, an elegant mien.", "Good humour with health's rosy hue</br>Were display'd in her eye and her cheek,</br>And good sense stood confest to your view,</br>E'er she open'd her mouth for to speak.</br>In each feature much sweetness did shine,</br>When I told her how much I was caught,</br>And she cry'd, with a voice half divine,</br>'Tis by worth I'm alone to be caught.", "Then from hence learn, ye swains, who're afraid</br>That the nymphs will from constancy swerve,</br>That like me you may gain the dear maid,</br>If you study that bliss to deserve,</br>'Tis not dress, or a gay easy air,</br>That will take with a sensible mind;</br>Be tender, polite, and ne'er fear</br>But the nymphs will be faithful and kind.</br>"]
