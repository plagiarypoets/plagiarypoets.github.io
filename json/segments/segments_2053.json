["Pilgrim, whose heart with quicker pulse doth beat</br>Where virtue and brave deeds make holy ground!</br>Thou, who hast journied with unwearying feet,</br>Where'er bright history of the past is found:&mdash;</br>Altar, nor dome, nor consecrated mound,</br>May kindle in thy breast diviner fire</br>Than this lone tomb: &mdash; the mountains wall it round;</br>Immortal memory guards it to inspire</br>From Hofer's ashes life &mdash; the Phoenix from its pyre.", "Bard, who hast twined thy lyre with living bays,</br>Kindling young spirits to enthusiast glow!</br>The deeds of these, the tales of other days</br>Singing, of beauty, valour, worth and woe,</br>Yet for awhile all lighter themes forego;</br>Waste not the fervour of thy song on aught</br>Of meaner worth: &mdash; one thoughtful lay bestow</br>On him the mountain-chief whose spirit caught</br>Lightning from Freedom's eye, unbowed, unswayed, unbought.", "Son of thy country, whosoe'er thou art</br>That groanest for her, and would'st fain pluck out</br>The tyrant's barbed iron from her heart!</br>Thou that cost hear the insulting conqueror shout,</br>Drowning the cry of freedom, &mdash; seest the rout,</br>The carnage and the ruin? &mdash; Wilt thou fear?&mdash;</br>Shake off thy coward fetters, and thy doubt;</br>Stand as he stood whose name is graven here;</br>Thy death, like his, may be to Freedom shield and spear.</br>"]
