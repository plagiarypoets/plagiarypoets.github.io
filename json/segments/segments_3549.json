["Come, gentle Muse of Pity, bring thy lute</br>Of soothing sound!  A scene of tender woe</br>Demands thy song!  If e'er thy throbbing breast,</br>Still kindly heaving with the frequent sigh</br>For others sad Calamity, did make</br>The tomb of youthful Merit, early snatch'd</br>From the keen eye of Hope, thy tuneful theme!</br>If e'er thy soft harmonious soul, infus'd</br>In melting number, from the tearful eye</br>Of groaning Anguish, stole the falling Woe,</br>And from the Parent's bleeding bosom drew</br>The goring shaft, &mdash; here may thy sacred art</br>The pious work perform! &mdash; or if thou can'st</br>Wipe off the stains of Grief from Beauty's cheek,</br>And, like the genial Sun, disperse the mist</br>From nature's fairest blooms, and give their charms</br>Back to the eye of Rapture! &mdash; to thy fane</br>Lovers shall bow, and altars rise to thee!</br>For, ah!  the youthful subject of my lay,</br>Adonis-like, by this untimely fate,</br>Has dim'd bright Beauty's beam!  Sweet, hapless Youth!</br>What now avails thy form, so fram'd for love,</br>So soft, and graceful! &mdash; What, thy gentle air!</br>Where hid beneath the unasuming veil</br>Of candid Modesty, from Envy's glance</br>Thy Merit sought [illegible] &mdash; but in vain!</br>Where wast thou, Phoebus, and the tuneful Nine!</br>Where were ye, when your lov'd fav'rite Son,</br>Sunk in the fatal wave?  Could ye not charm,</br>With those resistless pow'rs with which ye deign'd</br>In [illegible] magic strains, the outstrech'd hand</br>Of [illegible]?  Or could you not, as erst,</br>By [illegible], Orpheus, call him back</br>From the drear shades of Death! &mdash; O, had he liv'd!....</br>"]
