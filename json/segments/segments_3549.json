["When my Eyes first with Phillis's met,</br>How each tender Passion arose!</br>How my Heart more than usually beat!</br>Neglecting its wonted Repose.</br>In my Breast heav'd impatient the Sigh,</br>And then vented itself with a Tear;</br>And when Phillis no longer was nigh,</br>I was tortur'd with Grief and Despair.", "Ah!  why did I gazing admire!</br>For I'm certain she cannot be mine;</br>Since Beauty and Wealth all conspire</br>To frustrate my hopeless Design.</br>The Flocks of her Sheep and her Kine</br>In a large fertile Meadow may roam,</br>Whilst the few Fate alloted as mine,</br>I'm forc'd to tend close by my Home.", "Ere I chanc'd the dear Charmer to see,</br>Well pleas'd my Flock I could tend;</br>Their Frolics gave Pleasure to me,</br>But that Pleasure is now at an End!</br>By my Side lies neglected my Lute!</br>No more the soft Notes can I trace!</br>I've no Thoughts of my Pipe or my Flute,</br>Or of ought but my Phillis's Face!", "No more in the Dance on the Plains</br>Do I strive to divert the gay Fair;</br>No more in the Sports on the Plains</br>Can I take any Pleasure to share.</br>The Reason they often implore,</br>And beg to partake of my Woe;</br>But I sigh, and I answer no more,</br>Than \"Time will the Cause of it show.\"", "Oh, ye Groves, once my Scenes of Delight,</br>The Pleasures you gave me are o'er!</br>Your Prospects, that once pleas'd my Sight,</br>Will not Please me again any more!</br>'Tis the Love of bright Phillis the Fair</br>That could e'er make me happy again;</br>Since I'm certain her Love not to share,</br>I must ever unhappy remain.</br>"]
