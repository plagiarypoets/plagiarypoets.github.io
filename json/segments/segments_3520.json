["From gayer scenes, where Pleasure's mad career</br>Infects the milder avenues of thought,</br>Where secret Envy swells the note of Fear,</br>And Hope is in its own illusion caught;", "Where, in Ambition's thorny path of power,</br>Contending votaries bow to toils of State,</br>I turn, regardless of the passing hour,</br>To trace the havock of avenging Fate.", "Ne'er may the wanton love of active life</br>Control the sager prescript of repose!</br>Ne'er may the murmurs of tumultuous strife,</br>Wreck the tranquility of private woes!", "Here, on the crumbling relick of a stone,</br>On which the pride of masonry has smil'd,</br>Here, am I won't to ruminate alone,</br>And pause, in Fancy's airy robe beguil'd.", "Disparting time the tower of ages bends,</br>Forms, and indignant sinks, the proudest plan;</br>O'er the neglected path the weed extends,</br>Nor heeds the wandering step of thoughtful man.", "Here expiation murder has appeas'd,</br>Treason and homicide have been forgiven;</br>Pious Credulity her votaries eas'd,</br>Nor blam'd the indulgent Majesty of Heaven.", "Some erring matron has her crimes disclos'd;</br>Some father, conscious of awakening fate,</br>Safe from revenge has innocence repos'd,</br>Unseen and undisturb'd at other's hate.", "Sated with conquest from the noise of arms</br>The aged warrior with his fame retir'd,</br>Careless of thirsty spoil, of war'd alarms,</br>Nor with imperial emulation fir'd.", "Where once her orisons Devotion paid,</br>By fear, or hope, or reverence, inspir'd,</br>The sad solicitude of youth allay'd,</br>And age in resignation calm attir'd.", "The harmless cottager, from winds severe,</br>His humble habitation oft hath made;</br>Once gloomy Penitence sat silent there,</br>And midnight tapers gleam'd along the shade.", "The lonely shepherd here has oft retir'd,</br>To count his flock, and tune his rustic lay,</br>Where loud Hosannahs distant ears inspir'd,</br>And saintly vesper clos'd the solemn day.</br>"]
