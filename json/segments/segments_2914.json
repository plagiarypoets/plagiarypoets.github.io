["What shrieks burst through the murky air!</br>The voice of horror sounds again,</br>And, lo!  encircled by his daemon train,</br>The black, grim-visag'd genius of DESPAIR!", "Yonder he stands! &mdash; around him wait,</br>In all the pomp of sullen state,</br>Remorse and Guilt, whose troubled breast</br>Hope's flattering gales ne'er lull to rest,</br>While Conscience acts the torturer's part,</br>And gnaws with venom'd stings their heart.", "And there &mdash; while DANGER'S giant form</br>Stalks through the horrors of the hurtling storm,</br>Whose voice what mortal unappall'd can hear!</br>Shivers aghast the phantom FEAR.</br>There MADNESS too, whose shatter'd hair</br>Wildly streaming mocks the air;</br>His blood-shot eye-balls sparkle fire,</br>And burst with ineffectual ire,</br>While still by fits he shakes his hundred chains,</br>Loud laughs with ghastly grin, or roars along the plains.", "By the flitting gleams of light</br>Appears what yet escap'd my sight!</br>Ah!  see the self-devoted band!</br>Each grasps a poniard in his hand!</br>With banning voice, that rends the sky,</br>They call DESPAIR!  DESPAIR is nigh.</br>Far from the realms of cheerful day,</br>The night-born chieftain leads the way.</br>High on yon cliff, whose beetling brow</br>Frowns o'er the gulph of death below,</br>Awhile they stand.  Hell's ravening brood,</br>That glut their thirst with human blood,</br>Catching quick the tainted gale,</br>The promis'd feast in harsh screams hail:</br>Prelusive lightenings dart around,</br>And bellowing thunders shake the ground:</br>Amidst the elemental shock,</br>They deeply strike the sudden blow,</br>Then plunge them headlong from the rock</br>Into the torrent tide, that whelms its prey below.</br>"]
