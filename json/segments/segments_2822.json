["There liv'd, beneath an aged oak,</br>A shrub or two, who thus bespoke</br>Their guardian Tree, \"How fine you spread,</br>And lift into the heavens your head,</br>With glossy leaves, and branching arms,</br>Extending to the sun your charms:</br>Whilst we stand here in piteous plight,</br>Deny'd the very air, and light;</br>Most humbly bend, &mdash; scarce see the sun,&mdash;</br>What, for such usage, have we done?</br>What a mean figure we have made,</br>Out of Court-sunshine, in your shade;</br>Tho' swoln to an enormous size,</br>Remember whom we aggrandize;</br>Yet nothing have, but leaves, or loppings,</br>Besides some filthy rain, or droppings;</br>Which only tend to make us sower,</br>Else fair, and sweet as any flower,</br>We might, as well as others, rise,</br>And shoot our heads into the skies.</br>But now, you only stand aloof,</br>Catch, and turn all to your behoof:</br>While we, below, you scorn and scoff,</br>Seem only made, to set you off.</br>Tho' the same wood, the self-same earth,</br>Gave us all, nutriment and birth,</br>We dare not raise aloft our head,</br>Tho' full as nobly born and bred.", "The heart of oak with high disdain,</br>Reply'd &mdash; \"I've heard you fools complain;</br>But know this clamour's out of season,</br>Against my eminence 'tis treason:</br>Such scrubs have been too long protected;</br>By every one, but me, rejected.</br>Had you not murmur'd you might lie,</br>All safe, thro' your obscurity;</br>But now, since you're so saucy grown,</br>Of driving winds and rain the scorn,</br>I'll leave you. &mdash; Then his arms withdrew,</br>And left them all exposed to view.", "The bleak winds came, the driving rains,</br>Descending, swept part off the plains;</br>A part was trod into the mire;</br>The rest, made fuel, food for fire:</br>The farmer came, in bundles bound</br>The residue, and clear'd the ground.</br>"]
