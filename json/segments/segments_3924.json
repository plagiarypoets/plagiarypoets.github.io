["Since dear Phillis no longer will smile,</br>Alas, Corydon hard is thy lot;</br>She has left thee to linger awhile,</br>And thy person will soon be forgot.</br>Sure the rose bud no longer shall bloom,</br>And sweeten with fragrance the air,</br>Or the jessamine render perfume;</br>To Corydon lost in despair.", "To a shepherd that's robb'd of his ease,</br>By a maid that he tenderly loves,</br>Whose delight and whose joy was to please</br>The dear object he so much approves.</br>Tho' Phoebe has told me she burnt with a flame,</br>That has ever been constant and true,</br>With scorn I repell'd her, and thought her to blame,</br>Since my heart I had given to you.", "Now I wish that my Phillis had thought</br>That her Corydon never deceiv'd,</br>That her heart was with tenderness fraught,</br>And its dictates she might have believed.</br>Alas, must I say, my dear Phillis, adieu!</br>Ah, adieu!  the delight of my heart;</br>Adieu to an object so charming, so charming as you,</br>Ah, then must your Corydon part.", "To the fates so unfeeling I bend,</br>But each moment will think on my grief,</br>And my bosom unfold to my friend,</br>And from him will I seek my relief;</br>And my pipe I'll no longer employ,</br>But this moment will break it in twain,</br>Since it cannot resound with my joy,</br>It no longer shall echo my pain.</br>"]
