["When Eucritus and I, with one consent,</br>Join'd by Amyntas, from the city went,</br>And in our progress, meditating slow,</br>March'd where the waters of Halenta flow:</br>Antigenes and Phrasidamus, names</br>Renown'd afar, for each bright honour claims,</br>The sons of Lycopeus, at the shrine</br>Of fruitful Ceres offer'd rites divine:</br>In their rich veins the blood divinely roll'd</br>Of Clytia virtuous, and of Chalcon bold;</br>Chalcon, supreme of Cos, at whose command</br>The Burine fountain flow'd, and fertiliz'd the land;</br>Near it tall elms their amorous arms inwove</br>With poplars pale, and form'd a shady grove.</br>Scarce had we measur'd half our destin'd way,</br>Nor could the tomb of Brasilas survey;</br>When, travelling on the road, we chanc'd to meet</br>The tuneful goatherd, Lycidas, of Crete;</br>His very looks confest his trade; you'd swear</br>The man a goatherd by his gait and air:</br>His shoulders broad a goatskin white array'd,</br>Shaggy and rough, which smelt as newly flay'd;</br>A thread-bare mantle wrapt his breast around,</br>Which with a wide-wove surcingle he bound:</br>In his right hand, of rough wild-olive made,</br>A rustic crook his steps securely stay'd;</br>A smile serenely cheer'd his gentle look,</br>And thus, with pleasure in his eye, he spoke:", "'Whither, Simichidas, so fast away,</br>Now when meridian beams inflame the day?</br>Now when green lizards in the hedges lie,</br>And crested larks forsake the fervid sky.</br>Say, does the proffer'd feast your haste excite,</br>Or to the wine-press some old friend invite?</br>For such your speed, the pebbles on the ground,</br>Dash'd by your clogs, at every step resound!'", "Then I; \"Dear Lycidas, so sweet your strains,</br>You shame the reapers and the shepherd-swains;</br>Your pipe's fam'd numbers, tho' they please me well,</br>Hope spurs me on to rival, or excell:</br>We go great Ceres' festival to share;</br>Our honour'd friends the sacred rites prepare:</br>To her they bring the first fruit of their store,</br>For with abundance she has blest their floor.</br>But since, my friend, we steer one common way,</br>And share the common blessings of the day,</br>Let us, as thus we gently pace along,</br>Divert the journey with bucolic song.</br>Me the fond swains have honour'd from my youth,</br>And call the Muses' most melodious mouth;</br>They strive my ears incredulous to catch</br>With praise, in vain; for I, who ne'er can match</br>Sicelidas, or sweet Philetas' song,</br>Croak like a frog the grashoppers among.\"", "Thus with alluring words I sooth'd the man,</br>And thus the goatherd, with a smile, began:", "'Accept this crook, small token of my love,</br>For sure you draw your origin from Jove!</br>I scorn the builder, who, to show his skill,</br>Rears walls to match Oromedon's proud hill;</br>Nor do those poets merit more regard</br>Who dare to emulate the Chian bard.</br>Since songs are grateful to the shepherd swain,</br>Let each rehearse some sweet bucolic strain;</br>I'll sing those lays (and may the numbers please)</br>Which late last spring I labour'd at my ease.'", "\"Oh may Ageanax, with prosperous gale,</br>To Mitylene, the pride of Lesbos, sail!</br>Though now the south winds the vext ocean sweep,</br>And stern Orion walks upon the deep;</br>So will he soothe those love-consuming pains</br>That burn my breast and glow within my veins.</br>May Halcyons smooth the waves, and calm the seas,</br>And the rough south-east sink into a breeze;</br>Halcyons, of all the birds that haunt the main,</br>Most lov'd and honour'd by the Nereid train.</br>May all things smile propitious while he sails!</br>To the wish'd port convey him safe, ye gales!</br>Then shall my brows with violets be crown'd,</br>Or dill sweet-smelling, or with roses bound:</br>Before the hearth I'll quaff the Ptelean bowl;</br>Parch'd beans shall stimulate my thirsty soul:</br>High as my arms the flowery couch shall swell</br>Of flea-bane, parsley, and sweet asphodell.</br>Mindful of dear Ageanax, I'll drink,</br>Till to the lees the rosy bowl I sink.</br>Two shepherds sweetly on the pipe shall play,</br>And Tityrus exalt the vocal lay;</br>Shall sing how Daphnis the coy damsel lov'd,</br>And, her pursuing, o'er the mountains rov'd;</br>How the rough oaks bewail'd his fate, that grow</br>Where Himera's meandring waters flow;</br>While he still urg'd o'er Rhodope his flight,</br>O'er Haemus, Caucasus, or Atho's height,</br>And, like the snow that on their tops appears,</br>Dissolv'd in love, as that dissolves in tears.</br>Next he shall sing the much-enduring hind</br>By his harsh lord in cedar chest confin'd;</br>And how the honey bees, from roseat bowers,</br>Sustain'd him with the quintessence of flowers;</br>For on his lips the Muse her balm distill'd,</br>And his sweet mouth with sweetest nectar fill'd.</br>O blest Comatas!  nobly hast thou sped,</br>Confin'd all spring, to be with honey fed!</br>O had'st thou liv'd in these auspicious days!</br>I'd drive thy goats on breezy hills to graze,</br>While thou should'st under oaken shades recline,</br>Or sweetly chant beneath the verdant pine.\"", "He sung &mdash; and thus I answer'd:  'Friendly swain,</br>Far other numbers me the wood-nymph train</br>Taught, when my herds along the hills I drove,</br>Whose fame, perchance, has reach'd the throne of Jove.</br>Yet, for thy sake, the choicest will I chuse;</br>Then lend an ear, thou darling of the Muse!'", "\"On me bland Cupids sneez'd, who Myrto love</br>Dearly, as kids the spring-embellish'd grove:</br>Aratus too, whose friendship is my joy,</br>Aratus fondly loves the beauteous boy:</br>And well Aristis, to the Muses dear,</br>Whose lyre Apollo would vouchsafe to hear,</br>And well Aristis knows, renown'd for truth,</br>How fond Aratus loves the blooming youth.</br>O Pan!  whom Omole's fair mountain charms,</br>Place him, uncall'd, in dear Aratus' arms!</br>Whether Philinus, or some softer name:</br>Then may Arcadian youths no longer maim,</br>With scaly squills, thy shoulders or thy side,</br>When in the chace no venison is supply'd.</br>But may'st thou, if thou dar'st my boon deny,</br>Torn by fell claws, on beds of nettles lie,</br>All the cold winter freeze beneath the pole</br>Where Hebrus' waves down Edon's mountains roll;</br>In summer, glow in Aethiopia's fires,</br>Where under Blemyan rocks scorch'd Nile retires.</br>Leave, O ye Loves, whose cheeks out-blush the rose!</br>The meads where Hyetis and Byblis flows,</br>To fair Dione's sacred hill remove,</br>And bid the coy Philinus glow with love.</br>Though as a pear he's ripe, the women say,</br>Thy bloom, alas!  Philinus, fades away!</br>No more, Aratus, let us watch so late,</br>Nor nightly serenade before his gate:</br>But in this school let some unmeaning sot</br>Toil when the first cock crows, and hanging be his lot.</br>Rest be our portion!  and, with potent charm,</br>May some enchantress keep us free from harm!\"", "I sung:  he view'd me with a smiling look;</br>And for my song presented me his crook:</br>Then to the left he turn'd, through flowery meads,</br>The winding path-way that to Pyxa leads;</br>While with my friends I took the right-hand road</br>Where Phrasidamus makes his sweet abode;</br>Who courteous bad us on soft beds recline</br>Of lentisk, and young branches of the vine;</br>Poplars and elms above, their foliage spread,</br>Lent a cool shade, and wav'd the breezy head;</br>Below, a stream, from the Nymphs' sacred cave,</br>In free meanders led its murmuring wave:</br>In the warm sun-beams, verdant shrubs among,</br>Shrill grashoppers renew'd their plaintive song:</br>At distance far, conceal'd in shades, alone,</br>Sweet Philomela pour'd her tuneful moan:</br>The lark, the goldfinch warbled lays of love,</br>And sweetly pensive coo'd the turtle dove:</br>While honey-bees, for ever on the wing,</br>Humm'd round the flowers, or sipt the silver spring.</br>The rich, ripe season gratified the sense</br>With summer's sweets, and autumn's redolence.</br>Apples and pears lay strew'd in heaps around,</br>And the plum's loaded branches kiss'd the ground.</br>Wine flow'd abundant from capacious tuns,</br>Matur'd divinely by four summers suns,</br>Say, nymphs of Castaly!  for ye can tell,</br>Who on the summit of Parnassus dwell,</br>Did Chiron e'er to Hercules produce</br>In Pholus' cave such bowls of generous juice?</br>Did Polypheme, who from the mountain's steep</br>Hurl'd rocks at vessels sailing on the deep,</br>E'er drain the goblet with such nectar crown'd,</br>Nectar that nimbly made the Cyclops bound,</br>As then, ye Nymphs!  at Ceres' holy shrine</br>Ye mix'd the milk, the honey, and the wine.</br>O may I prove once more that happy man</br>In her large heaps to fix the purging fan!</br>And may the goddess smile serene and bland,</br>While ears of corn, and poppies grace her hand.</br>"]
