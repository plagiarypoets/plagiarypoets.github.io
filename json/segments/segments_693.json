["Hence, dull lethargic Peace;</br>Born in some hoary Beadsman's cell obscure,</br>Or in Circean bower,</br>Where Manhood dies, and Reason's vigils cease.</br>Hie to congenial climes;</br>Where some seraglio's downy tyrant reigns,</br>Or where Italian swains,</br>Midst wavy shades, and myrtle-blooming bowers,</br>Lull their ambrosial hours,</br>And deck with languid trills their tinkling rhymes.</br>But rouse, thou God by Furies drest,</br>In helm with Terror's plumed crest,</br>In adamantine steel bedight,</br>Glistering formidably bright,</br>With step unfix'd and aspect wild;</br>Jealous Juno's raging child,</br>Who thee conceiv'd in Flora's bower,</br>By touch of rare Olenian flower:</br>Oft the goddess sigh'd in vain,</br>Envying Jove's prolific brain,</br>And oft she stray'd Olympus round,</br>Till this specific held she found;</br>Then fruitful grown, she quits the skies,</br>To Thracia's sanguine plain she hies,</br>There teems thee forth, of nervous mold,</br>Haughty, furious, swift, and bold,</br>Names thee Mars, and bids thee call</br>The world from Pleasure's flowery thrall.</br>Come then, Genius of the war,</br>Roll me in thine iron car;</br>And as thy coursers pierce the sky,</br>Breathing fury as they fly,</br>Let Courage hurry swift before,</br>All stain'd around with purple gore,</br>And Victory follow close behind,</br>With wreath of palm and laurel join'd,</br>While high above, fair Fame assumes</br>Her place, and waves her eagle plumes.</br>Then let the trumpet swell the note,</br>Roaring rough thro' brazen throat;</br>Let the drum sonorous beat,</br>With thick vibrations hoarsely sweet;</br>Boxen hautboys too be found,</br>Nor be miss'd the fife's shrill sound,</br>Nor yet the bagpipe's swelling strain,</br>Solace sweet to Highland swain,</br>Whether on some mountain's brow,</br>Now squeaking high, now droning low,</br>He plays deft lilts to Scottish lass</br>Tripping it o'er the pliant grass,</br>Or whether in the battle's fray</br>He lively pipes a bolder lay;</br>The bolder lay (such magic reigns</br>In all its moving Phrygian strains)</br>Disperses swift to all the train,</br>Fury stern, and pale Disdain</br>Strikes every fire from every mind,</br>Nor leaves one latent spark behind.</br>Bear me now to tented ground,</br>Where gallant streamers wave around,</br>And Britain's ensigns high display'd,</br>Lend the earth a scarlet shade,</br>And pikes, and spears, and lances gay,</br>Glitter in the solar ray;</br>There to join the hardy crowd,</br>As they sport in gamesome mood,</br>Wrestling on the circled ground</br>Wreathing limbs with limbs around;</br>Or see them pitch the massy bar,</br>Or teach the disk to whizz in air;</br>And when the night returns, regale</br>With chat full blunt, and chirping ale;</br>While some voice of manly base</br>Sings my darling Chevy-Chace;</br>How the child, that's yet unborn,</br>May rue earl Percy's hound and horn;</br>How Witherington in doleful dumps,</br>Fought right valiant on his stumps;</br>And many a knight and 'squire full gay</br>At morn, at night were clad in clay;</br>While first and last, we join to sing,</br>\"God prosper long our noble king!\"</br>And when Midnight spreads around</br>Her sable vestments on the ground,</br>Hence I'll, for a studious seat</br>To some strong citadel retreat,</br>By ditch and rampart high ypent,</br>And battery strong and battlement!</br>There in some state-room richly dight</br>With maily coats and faulchions bright,</br>Emblazon'd shields quaint impress,</br>And a whole army's glittering dress,</br>While the taper burneth blue</br>(As Brutus once was wont to do),</br>Let me turn the ample page</br>Of some grave historic Sage;</br>Or in Homer's sacred song,</br>Mix the Grecian bands among,</br>Nestor wise with silver'd head,</br>And Ajax stern, and Diomed,</br>And many more, whose wonderous might</br>Could equal e'en the gods in sight;</br>Or list to Virgil's epic lyre,</br>Or lofty Lucan wrapp'd in fire;</br>But rather still let Shakespeare's Muse</br>Her genuine British fires diffuse;</br>And briskly with her magic strain</br>Hurry me to Gallic plain,</br>What time the gallant Talbot bleeds,</br>Or when heaven-prosper'd Harry leads</br>His troups with sevenfold courage steel'd,</br>To Agincourt's immortal field.</br>But when th' imbattled troops advance,</br>O Mars, my every thought intrance!</br>Guide me, thundering martial god,</br>Guide thro' Glory's arduous road!</br>While hailing bullets round me fly,</br>And human thunders shake the sky,</br>While crowds of heroes heap the ground,</br>And dying groans are heard around,</br>With armour clanking, clarions sounding,</br>Cannons bellowing, shouts rebounding;</br>Guide me, thundering, martial god,</br>Guide me thro' Glory's arduous road!</br>But should on land thy triumphs cease,</br>Still lead me far from hated Peace;</br>Me bear, dread Power, for warlike sport,</br>To some wave-incircled fort;</br>Or (if it yield more open sight)</br>To some hoar promontory's height,</br>Whose high arch'd brow o'erlooks the scene,</br>Where Tritons blue and Naiads green,</br>Sportive from their coral cave,</br>Through the fluid chrystal lave;</br>There eagerly I ken from far</br>All the waste of naval War,</br>And catch a sympathetic rage,</br>While the numerous fleets engage,</br>And every distant shore rebounds</br>To the cannons rattling sounds,</br>And the sulphurous fireship rends,</br>And thousand fates around her sends,</br>And limbs dissever'd hurl'd on high,</br>Smoke amid th' affrighted sky.</br>Then let black clouds above my head,</br>With gleams of scarlet thick bespread,</br>With lightning's flash and thunder's growl,</br>Suit the spleen that shades my soul.</br>There too let cranes, a numerous flight,</br>With beaks and claws rage bloody fight,</br>And airy knights from every cloud</br>Prick forth, their armour rattling loud;</br>With blazing swords, and comets drear,</br>Dragging a trail of flaming hair;</br>Such as diffus'd their baneful gleam</br>Over besieg'd Jerusalem,</br>Or hung o'er Rome e'er Julius fell,</br>And if old Sages rightly spell,</br>Were ever deemed to foreshow</br>Changes in our realms below.", "And when at length cold creeping Age</br>Freezes the current of my rage,</br>Let me live amongst a crew</br>Of invalids, of kindred hue!</br>Of some main limb bereft by War,</br>Or blest with some deep glorious scar;</br>Scar, that endless glory draws</br>From Liberty and Albion's cause:</br>And oft well pleas'd with them retire,</br>To circle round a sea-coal fire,</br>And all our past campaigns recite,</br>Of Vigo's sack and Blenheim fight;</br>How valiant Rooke majestic trod,</br>How Marlbro' thunder'd; half a god!</br>And then, with sage prophetic eye,</br>In future battles to descry,</br>That Britain shall not fail to yield</br>Equal generals for the field;</br>That France again shall pour her blood,</br>And Danube roll a purpled flood.", "And when my children round me throng,</br>The same grand theme shall grace my tongue;</br>To teach them, should fair England need</br>Their blood, 'tis theirs to wish to bleed;</br>And, as I speak, to mark with joy</br>New courage start in every boy;</br>And gladsome read in all their eyes,</br>Each will a future hero rise.</br>These delights if Mars afford,</br>Mars, with thee I whet my sword.</br>"]
