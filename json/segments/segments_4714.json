["Olivia, though Strephon I praise,</br>His wit and good humour approve,</br>Though the beauty, I own, of his lays,</br>Yet still I may not be in love.</br>His merit was always allow'd,</br>By ev'ry gay nymph on the plain,</br>And I sure must be stupid or proud,</br>Not to join in the praise of the swain.", "But when each dear look I admire,</br>When with raptures I list to his song,</br>When my heart it beats time to his lyre,</br>And the minutes without him seem long;</br>Then I fear, that not friendship alone,</br>My heart could so readily move;</br>Yet I'm still at a loss, I must own&mdash;</br>For it cannot &mdash; it must not be love.", "To her friend thus the shepherdess said,</br>Who suspected a little deceit,</br>With smiles she reply'd to the maid,</br>(Resolv'd to discover the cheat,)</br>\"Suppose he was equally charm'd,</br>Say, could you the shepherd approve?\"</br>The nymph of her caution disarm'd,</br>With blushes confest &mdash; she could love.</br>"]
