["A Small neat house, and little spot of ground,</br>Where herbs, and fruits, and kitchen stuff were found,</br>The humble vicar of North-Wilford  blest;</br>Small was his living &mdash; but his heart at rest:</br>Unseen, unblam'd, he pass'd his time away;</br>He smok'd, or wrote, or mus'd, or walk'd all day</br>Thro' all the year, no anxious cares he knew,</br>But just at Easter when he claim'd his due:</br>And then the surly rustics churlish pride,</br>His well-earn'd tythes, disputed or deny'd.</br>The vicar, still, preferring want to strife,</br>Gave up his due to lead a peaceful life.</br>His garden once in pensive mood he sought,</br>His pipe attended as a friend to thought:</br>And while the smoke in eddies round him play'd,</br>A neighb'ring vicar entring he survey'd;</br>One like himself; a down-right honest priest,</br>Whose scanty dues his love of peace decreas'd.</br>Suppose the little ceremonies done,</br>And all the rites of lighting pipes begun;</br>Suppose the whiffs in sober sort flow round,</br>And both in musing very deeply drown'd:</br>For so it was till thus the first good man,</br>Fetch'd a deep whiff, and anxiously began.", "FIRST PARSON.</br>Wou'd God (my friend!)  his goodness had assign'd</br>Some lot more suited to my feeling mind:</br>Less tho' my income, if from torture free;</br>Content wou'd well supply the loss to me.</br>For all the pence, the little dues I glean,</br>Or raise my scorn, my pity, or my spleen:</br>I'll tell thee but e'en now a neighbour came,</br>Pale want diffus'd o'er all his meagre frame.</br>Five-pence the sum; he gave a shilling o'er,</br>Kind shook his head, and wish'd he cou'd do more:</br>I turn'd away, nor cou'd from tears refrain,</br>'Twas death to take it &mdash; to refuse it vain.", "SECOND PARSON.</br>Such gentle manners more afflict the mind,</br>Than the rough rudeness of the baser kind:</br>Just ere I came, a rustic braggart elf,</br>Proud of his purse, and glorying in his pelf,</br>Approach'd, and bold demanded what to pay,</br>What claims the priest whom we maintain to pray?</br>The account he gave me of his stock, I knew,</br>Was half curtail'd and scarce one number true:</br>Howe'er, my silence favour'd the deceit,</br>And fond of quiet I conceal'd the cheat;</br>Yet, when the small, the half demand I made,</br>He bully'd, swore, and damn'd the preaching trade;</br>All God's good household with irrev'rence curst,</br>And me, with foul abuse, is far the worst:</br>Thou know'st, my friend, what agonizing,</br>Such brutal outrage gives a tender heart.", "FIRST PARSON.</br>Too well, alas, too fatally I know&mdash;</br>From whence these complicated evils flow;</br>From tythes, from tythes, the clergy's woes arise,</br>They mar religion, nay, they rob the skies:</br>Wou'd God, our monarch's ever gracious hand</br>In this wou'd deign to bless the wretched land:</br>Wou'd God, the tythes like taxes might be pay'd,</br>A fix'd revenue by some statute made;</br>How then wou'd blest religion rear her head!</br>How thro' each village kindly virtue spread!</br>What souls with heav'nly comforts wou'd be blest, How happy, then, parishioner and priest!</br>Thus of true grievances the priests repin'd,</br>And with their own, spoke all their brethrens' mind:</br>When toil'd the belly and to the church slow move,</br>Six virgins bearing one, that died for love:</br>The grave debate was silenc'd by the bell,</br>The vicars rose, and kindly took farewell.</br>The first, his sermon seeks, and hastes away</br>The last sad duties to the dead to pay</br>From love he much advis'd the youthful throng;</br>Drew tears from all, and pleas'd, tho' preaching long:</br>While slow, his brother, on his easy pad,</br>Pac'd home full grave, and ruminating sad.</br>"]
