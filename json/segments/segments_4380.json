["Say, wilt thou write romantic tales like Scott,</br>With all of fancy's wild magnificence?</br>Or strike like Campbell, a deep organ-note,</br>That thrills with rapture every captive sense?</br>Or fill, like Moore, the songs of ardent passion</br>With far-fetch'd similes &mdash; a strange transgression?", "Or wilt thou sit (like an hysteric maid)</br>Like Wordsworth, weeping o'er a faded daisy?</br>Or wrap thyself, like Coleridge, in a shade</br>Of unintelligible thoughts and mazy?</br>Or wade like Crabbe, through folly, vice, and dirt,</br>To talk with mortals that have scarce a shirt?", "Wilt thou, like Byron, with distorted mind,</br>Clothe home-ideas like the eastern kings,</br>And send them back again to dupe the blind,</br>Who hail them all as new created things?</br>Or try, like Percy Shelly &mdash; very odd!&mdash;</br>To wound the pious, and insult thy God?", "Or wilt thou venture, and succeed like Southey,</br>To pay addresses to the Epic Muse?</br>Or weave a web of recollections youthy,</br>As Rogers doth &mdash; though not of brightest hues?</br>Or like Montgomery, with a nameless art,</br>Pour forth the holiest feelings of the heart?", "Wilt thou, like Hunt, twine out a little story</br>Already told &mdash; twine half its charms away?</br>Like Milman, whose heroics gain no glory,</br>Write bulky dramas no body can play?</br>Or versify, as Barry Cornwall doth,</br>The thoughts of others &mdash; soft and soothing both?", "Wilt thou, like Hogg (though tinctured with barbarity)</br>Tell most delightful tales of fairy isles?</br>Like Bloomfield, who has lost his popularity,</br>Sing very pleasingly of rural toils?</br>Or throw, like Wilson, though too fond of dreams,</br>A light o'er nature which celestial seems?</br>"]
