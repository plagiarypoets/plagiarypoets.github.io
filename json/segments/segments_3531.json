["'Tis night:  and in this solemn hour of sleep,</br>What time the Screech-owl sails her heavy round,</br>And clamours discord o'er this spectered ground,</br>With lowly heart and pensive pace I creep&mdash;", "To view, alas!  Mortality's sad doom!&mdash;</br>The proud man's trophied urn, the hero's bust,</br>Serve but to aggravate the awful gloom:</br>The Vassal's mingled with the Tyrant's dust!", "Who but would mock yon sculptur'd skill to tell</br>His sceptered lineage, or his paltry throne,</br>When Worth has fled without a passing-bell,</br>And many an honest heart has sunk unknown;&mdash;", "When Genius could retreat without a sigh</br>Or friend to chaunt a requiem to his closing eye!</br>"]
