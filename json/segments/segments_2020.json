["When last we parted, Lady, 'twas in tears;</br>Thy cheek was dimmed with sorrow's trickling dew,</br>And from my heart the grief of many years,</br>Hoarded 'till nigh forgotten, burst anew,</br>Sad offerings to love and memory true.</br>Shall ever memory faint, or love be cold?</br>Ah, no!  that cheek may lose its breathing hue,</br>And those dear eyes their living beams withhold,</br>But love shall still endure, with faith unknown, untold.", "Accept the tribute that to thee I bring,</br>(It is the first, and it will be the last,)</br>The leisure fruit of fancy's wandering:</br>But fancy rules no more &mdash; her sway is past,</br>And into other paths my course is cast:</br>Me now no more shall fiction's dreams beguile;</br>Their hues like fading rainbows vanish fast;&mdash;</br>My feet shall tread in ways of drearier toil,</br>And fiction hide her wreath, and poesy her smile.", "Yet, if to me a loftier lyre were given,</br>And round my harp were twined a brighter wreath,&mdash;</br>If I could snatch immortal verse from heaven,</br>And pour its melody to souls beneath,&mdash;</br>It may be that I would not cease to breathe</br>Thy name in accents love should make divine,</br>And round thy beauteous brows a band enwreath,</br>A garland bright, whose flower should brightly shine,</br>More lovely, and more bright, when sunned by smiles of thine.", "My Lady Love!  am I not far from thee?&mdash;</br>Far, far away &mdash; but soon again we meet;</br>Ye moments swift, oh, yet more swiftly flee,</br>Ye slower hours, away on winged feet;</br>Waft me, oh, waft me upon pinions fleet,</br>Give me again my vows of love to tell,</br>Steal fond approval from her blushes sweet,</br>Adore her flowing cheek and bosom's swell,</br>And win the silent thoughts, that in that bosom dwell.</br>"]
