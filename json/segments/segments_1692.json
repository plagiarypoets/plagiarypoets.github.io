["I may not reach mine hand to yonder shell,</br>Where its high harmonies suspended sleep</br>On Albion's votive shrine; I may not swell</br>The glory of its concave's echoing sweep;</br>Till, borne upon her memory dear and deep,</br>PITT'S honour'd name hath worked the expectant string.</br>It is a name, whereon the virtues weep;</br>Which the proud patriot muse delights to sing;</br>As mingles with her lay its lofty triumphing.", "Thou wert no longer with us! &mdash; but thy spirit</br>Breathed in our heart and battled on our arm:</br>And still thy grateful Albion doth inherit</br>Its pow'r resistless, and its mighty charm.</br>Even in the perilous time, in that alarm,</br>When foreign envy banded for her doom,</br>And fear domestic quailed before the storm,</br>They sun-bright genius burst the gathered gloom;&mdash;</br>We heard its wakening voice, and felt it from the tomb.", "Spirit revered and sorrowed! &mdash; thou, whose care</br>Slept not on Albion's doubtful destiny!</br>Albion, thy living charge, thy dying prayer,</br>To her consummate glory asks thine eye.</br>Bend from thy blessed immortality,</br>And in their prosperous course her sons assure:&mdash;</br>For they have watch'd thy word &mdash; how faithfully!&mdash;</br>And always shall thy counsels, wise and pure,</br>Avenge their suffering past, their future peace secure!", "Oh when our wrath o'ertook the recreant Gaul,</br>And dashed him forth to exile and to shame,</br>When, seated on yon guilty capital,</br>Firm CASTLEREAGH pronounced our victor claim;</br>Thought we not then of PITT'S inspiring name?&mdash;</br>In that proud hour, which Providence hath given,</br>To join the pupil with the master's fame,</br>Back on its source we saw the tempest driven,</br>And his last prayer fulfill'd &mdash; \"OH SAVE MY COUNTRY, HEAVEN!\"</br>"]
