["She came from the hills of the west,</br>A smile of contentment she wore,</br>Her heart was a garden of rest,</br>But ah!  the sweet season is o'er.", "How oft by the streams in the wood,</br>Delighted she'd ramble and rove,</br>And while she stood marking the flood,</br>Would tune up a stanza of love.", "Her dress was a garment of green,</br>Set off with a border of white,</br>And all the day long might be seen,</br>Like a bird that is always in flight.", "In rural diversion and play,</br>Her summers glide smoothly along,</br>And her winters pass'd briskly away,</br>Cheered up with a tale or a song.", "At length a destroyer came by,</br>A youth of more person than parts,</br>Well skill'd in the arts of the eye,</br>The conquest and havoc of hearts.", "He led her by fountains and streams,</br>He woed her with novels and books,</br>He told her his tales and his dreams,</br>And mark'd their effect in her looks.", "He taught her by midnight to roam,</br>Where spirits and spectres affright,</br>For passions encrease with the gloom,</br>And caution expires with the light.", "At length like a rose from the spray,</br>Like a lily just pluck'd from the stem,</br>She droop'd and she faded away,</br>Thrown by and neglected like them.</br>"]
