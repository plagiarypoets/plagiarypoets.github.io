["O whether with laborious clowns</br>In meads and woods thou lov'st to dwell,</br>In noisy merchant-crouded towns,</br>Or in the temperate Brachman's cell;</br>Who from the meads of Ganges' fruitful flood,</br>Wet with sweet dews collects his flowery food;", "In Bath or in Montpellier's plains,</br>Or rich Bermudas' balmy isle,</br>Or the cold North, whose fur-clad swains</br>Ne'er saw the purple Autumn smile,</br>Who over alps of snow, and desarts drear,</br>By twinkling star-light drive the flying deer;", "O lovely queen of mirth and ease,</br>Whom absent, beauty, banquets, wine,</br>Wit, music, pomp, nor science please,</br>And kings on ivory couches pine,</br>Nature's kind nurse, to whom by gracious heav'n</br>To sooth the pangs of toilsome life 'tis giv'n;", "To aid a languid wretch repair,</br>Let pale-ey'd Grief thy presence fly,</br>The restless demon gloomy Care,</br>And meagre Melancholy die;</br>Drive to some lonely rock the giant Pain,</br>And bind him howling with a triple chain!", "O come, restore my aking sight,</br>Yet let me not on LAURA gaze,</br>Soon must I quit that dear delight,</br>O'erpower'd by Beauty's piercing rays;</br>Support my feeble feet, and largely shed</br>Thy oil of gladness on my fainting head:", "How nearly had my spirit past,</br>Till stopt by METCALF's skilful hand,</br>To Death's dark regions wide and wast,</br>And the black river's mournful strand;</br>Or to those vales of joy, and meadows blest,</br>Where sages, heroes, patriots, poets rest;", "Where MARO and MUSAEUS sit</br>List'ning to MILTON's loftier song,</br>With sacred silent wonder smit;</br>While, monarch of the tuneful throng,</br>Homer in rapture throws his trumpet down,</br>And to the Briton gives his amaranthine crown.</br>"]
