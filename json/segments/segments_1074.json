["When Gama first, with spirit unconfin'd,</br>Revolv'd the plan of commerce in his mind,</br>And found no common distance could prevail</br>To bound th' extent of his capacious scale;</br>His genius overlook'd with bold disdain</br>The banks of Tagus, and th' Atlantic Main;</br>And from the arms of more domestic ease,</br>Intrepid bore him into distant seas,</br>Which no audacious keel before had plough'd,</br>Still onward urging his untravel'd road,</br>Where the young sun, in orient ruby drest,</br>Is first awak'd upon the morning's breast;</br>And taught trade's empire, like the son, to own</br>No narrower limits than the world alone.</br>Like thy own Gama (let me call him thine)</br>The claim's attested by the sacred Nine;</br>Ingenious MICKLE, thy advent'rous lay</br>Scorns the worn track, and tempts a devious way:</br>Thy muse inspir'd with sympathetic pride</br>Forgoes and throws the humbler reed aside;</br>Which Mulla hearing slow had roll'd along,</br>Stay'd with the likeness of her SPENSER'S song;</br>And dares, superior to the narrow rules,</br>The pedant fetters which enslave the schools,</br>Fearless what unheard perils she may prove</br>In adding laurels to th' Aonian grove,</br>To pierce the depths of an unclassic shore,</br>And search a desart for a single flow'r.</br>Nor has thy hand with a successless toil</br>The growth transplanted to thy native soil:</br>Fresh shoots thy Scyon on an English stem;</br>Thy cut revives the lustre of the gem.</br>E'en CAMOEN'S self might envy thy success,</br>And wish his LUSIAD in no other dress:</br>Fix'd in suspense, and dubious which to boast,</br>It's first fair form, or transmigration most.</br>Long had the Muses mark'd th' advancing gloom</br>Of Gothic night, and fear'd the LUSIAD'S doom.</br>But fate forbade, and thou wer't sent to save</br>The wreck just whelm'd beneath oblivion's wave.</br>'Till now obscure the beauteous work had lain,</br>Like the new world, ere Gama dar'd the main;</br>Or, if e'er touch'd on, only known in part,</br>But faintly shadow'd out in Fanshaw's chart.</br>Unhappy Fanshaw!  whose ill-favour'd rhimes</br>Had caught the aukward spirit of the times;</br>Whose ev'ry number with its neighbour jars,</br>As if the Muses dealt in Civil Wars.</br>Ill-fated poet!  destin'd to an age</br>Of bigot jargon, and of factious rage;</br>When ev'ry page with quibble was o'er-run,</br>And sense tormented writh'd itself to pun.</br>When persecuted science stood aghast,</br>And arts, for want of patrons, breath'd their last;</br>And ev'ry other trade but that of blood,</br>In famish'd tortures gasp'd in vain for food.</br>That, and but that alone, luxurious far'd,</br>Nor more than monarch, than the subject spar'd.</br>And would the Muse not desert a land,</br>By crimes of such notorious hue profan'd?</br>Yes, heav'n descended, they forbore to stay,</br>And to the realms of peace re-trac'd their way.</br>Then let this prospect vindicate his lays,</br>Nor spleen abridge him of his share of praise;</br>Unenvy'd let him claim the first design</br>Which sketch'd the situation of the mine:</br>To thee 'twas left the treasures to explore,</br>And give a sterling impress to the ore;</br>That current it might pass through ev'ry clime,</br>And bear its value to remotest time.", "Say, when thy Hero leads thee on to try</br>The varying aspect of a foreign sky,</br>(Thy Muse collecting spirit from the course,</br>As streams grow wider farther from their source)</br>Springs not a just contempt within thy mind,</br>To view the objects thou hast left behind;</br>Critics and Rhymers at a distance hurl'd,</br>As Gama less'ning saw the western world?</br>Whilst back they turn, unable to pursue</br>With fearful admiration from the view;</br>Whilst wide of them thou spread'st the bolder sail,</br>And ev'ry muse inspires the prosp'rous gale.</br>Thus when the eagle, with undazzled gaze,</br>Sublimely tow'rs to meet the solar blaze;</br>The linnet from the spray, with aching sight,</br>Eyes the stretch'd wing, and wonders at the flight.", "Is there a tract of science unexplor'd,</br>Where sage has never pierc'd, or poet soar'd;</br>Embark auspicious!  from the womb of night</br>Call forth the new Atlantis to the light:</br>That not the smallest quotient may remain</br>Without the limits of the Muse's reign;</br>'Till thou may'st weep, like Macedonia's son,</br>When by his arms the universe was won,</br>With noble indignation touch'd; to view</br>No fresh supply of empires to subdue.</br>"]
