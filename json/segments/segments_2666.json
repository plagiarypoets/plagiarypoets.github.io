["Here rest their Heads in Power's and Honour's grave,</br>A band to Fortune and to Fame unknown</br>Fair Science never smil'd on their conclave,</br>And Scorn and Weakness mark'd them for their own.", "Large were their means, yet constant their defeat,</br>And France, deriding, mock'd their wild intentions;</br>They gave to England, all they could &mdash; a debt;</br>They gain'd from England, all they wish'd &mdash; their Pensions.", "Seek not (vain hope) their merits to disclose,</br>Nor paint their faults to sadden their condition</br>These let them try with trembling hope t' expose,</br>And those defend &mdash; on bench of Opposition.</br>"]
