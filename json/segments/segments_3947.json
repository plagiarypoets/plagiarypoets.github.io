["As Collin one morn went a-maying,</br>Thro' bow'ry retreats of the grove,</br>The wood-lark such fancies was playing</br>As Philomel could not improve.", "While he to the Syren's sweet lays</br>His eager attention devotes,</br>Through music's meander she strays,</br>Now sinking, now swelling the notes.", "At length, he in extacy cry'd,</br>\"Ah!  where could this science be found!</br>For whom is this minstrelsy ply'd!</br>For whom is this banquet of sound!\"", "Said a vision, \"'tis meet that you know,</br>The minstrel addresses each note</br>To Him, from whom bounty but flows,</br>Who taught ev'ry grace to her throat;", "\"Who now in beneficence gives</br>Parental delight to her breast,</br>From whose open hand she receives</br>Support for the young in her nest.", "\"Deem not that the notes from the spray</br>E'er prove as a waste of sweet sound,</br>For heard and approv'd is each lay&mdash;</br>Each lay the God's praise doth resound.", "\"Deem not that the flow'rets that blow,</br>And breathe in the lonely retreat,</br>Their sweets to the wilds but bestow,</br>As incense they offer each sweet.", "\"Ten thousand pure beings still rove</br>Unseen by corruption's gross eye,</br>To join in each song of the grove,</br>Each off'ring to waft in the sky.", "\"Though man never waken'd sweet praise,</br>Though thankless his bosom were found,</br>Chaste anthems the woodlands would raise,</br>Hallelujahs the vallies resound.", "\"Why were his vast faculties giv'n</br>To light him, why reason's blest beam,</br>If he leads not the chorus to heav'n,</br>If his gratitude proves not supreme?", "\"O youth!  this thy duty observe,</br>So ne'er shall thy pleasures decay;</br>'Twill prove the best honour to serve,</br>The glory 'twill prove to obey.", "\"Each morning to songs of pure praise,</br>Lyre-like whilst thou tunest thy heart,</br>Immortals shall list to thy lays,</br>As thou to yon wood poet's art.\"</br>"]
