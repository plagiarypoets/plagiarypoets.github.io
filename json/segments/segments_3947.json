["What Passions must those bosoms fill,</br>Whose fury Music cannot still;</br>Who, whilst the bowl with roses crown'd</br>In sweet society goes round,</br>Whilst mirth, and jest, and revelry,</br>Each breast from care should render free;</br>Whilst the brisk catch and roundelay</br>Each pow'r of melody display;</br>And whilst the festive vault resounds</br>The Chorus' animating sounds;</br>Who in the gay and sportive hour,</br>In Dalliance's appropriate bower,</br>Disdain with hearts of ten-fold steel,</br>The charms of harmony to feel;</br>And touch'd alone by civil broils,</br>\"By Treasons, Stratagems, and Spoils;\"</br>Disdaining Britain's happy state,</br>How favour'd by the will of Fate!</br>Where all the various parts we find</br>In diapason just combin'd;</br>Where wondering, envying nations see</br>A People without licence free;</br>(A King divine by Hea'vn's own choice,</br>His Subjects one united voice),</br>Who wish to blast this blessed land</br>By rules for other countries plann'd;</br>And British Liberty appall</br>By systems drawn from savage Gaul;</br>Which like the Tyrant's bed of old,</br>In iron arms its victims hold;</br>And 'midst their threats and piercing cries,</br>Torture them to one common size.</br>Come then, Apollo's fav'rite son,</br>My lov'd, my honour'd Harington,</br>With matchless skill who knows t' impart</br>The blessings of the healing art,</br>And with a master's hand untie</br>The twisted chains of harmony;</br>These sad discordant orgies quit,</br>For thy bright polish'd mind unfit;</br>Then join our Carbo's gen'rous board,</br>With food for mind and body stor'd;</br>Where with each grace of look and mien,</br>The partner of his cares is seen</br>The dubious and well chosen feast</br>To vouch to each enraptur'd guest;</br>Where candid, well read Webster pours</br>In purest streams his learned stores;</br>Sweet-bodies Ewart, Nature's child,</br>By every worldly art unspoil'd,</br>Delights with freedom to dispense</br>Th' effusions of his manly sense;</br>Where classic Parsons, fam'd for rhymes,</br>A rover in all Europe's climes,</br>His attic eloquence displays,</br>And pleases in a thousand ways;</br>Where, tho' the last, yet not the least,</br>Our Watson joins the jocund feast;</br>In whom indulgent Fate has joined</br>Each excellence of heart and mind;</br>Acuteness, common rules defying,</br>Thro' time and space with keenness prying;</br>Kindness and tenderness of soul,</br>That equality disdain controul,</br>That know no limit, own no bound,</br>Where men and misery are found.</br>"]
