["Not he, O Muse!  whom the auspicious eyes</br>Kind in his primeval hour beheld,</br>Shall victor in the Isthmian contest rise;</br>Nor o'er the long-resounding field</br>The rapid horse his kindling wheels shall roll,</br>Gay in th' Olympic race, and foremost at the goal.", "Nor in the Capitol, triumphant shown,</br>The victor laurel on his brow,</br>For the proud threats of vaunting kings o'erthrown;</br>But Tiber's streams, that warbling flow,</br>And groves of fragrant gloom, resound his strains,</br>Whose sweet Aeolian grace high celebration gains.", "Now that his name, her noblest bards among,</br>Th' imperial city loudly hails,</br>That proud distinction guards his rising song,</br>When Envy's carping tongue assails;</br>In sullen silence now she hears his praise,</br>Nor shed her canker'd spots upon his springing bays.", "O Muse!  who rulest every dulcet lay</br>That floats along the gilded shell;</br>That the mute tenant of the watery way</br>Canst teach, at pleasure, to excel</br>The softest notes harmonious sorrow brings,</br>When the expiring swan her own sad requiem sings.", "Thine be the praise, that pointing Romans guide</br>The stranger's eye, with proud desire,</br>That well he note the man, whom crowds decide</br>Should boldly string the Latian lyre.&mdash;</br>Ah!  when I please, if still to please be mine,</br>Nymph of th' Aeolian shell, be all the glory THINE.</br>"]
