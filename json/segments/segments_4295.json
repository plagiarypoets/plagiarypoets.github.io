["While skill'd in baneful arts th' enchantress tries</br>Thy dear Florella, Spenser, to chastize,</br>A nymph of snow she forms with nicest care,</br>And decks with ev'ry grace th' imagin'd fair,</br>Where all Florella's beauties seem'd confess'd,</br>Her voice, complexion, easy shape express'd!</br>More still this fictious charmer to complete,</br>She added graceful movements to her feet.</br>Struck like Ixion with this idol belle,</br>How many a hero in fierce combat fell!</br>But when the native fair advanc'd in view</br>The false by melting quickly own'd the true,</br>In sparkling drops distil her shining eyes,</br>And on her cheeks each transient beauty dies.</br>Vain all attempts to rival nature's charms,</br>Since native beauty magic power disarms.</br>"]
