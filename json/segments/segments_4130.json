["There up to heav'n a mass of rock was pil'd,</br>Which seem'd to mingle with the midnight sky;</br>Of rude access it was, and prospect wild,</br>And rear'd its proud ambitious head so high</br>As almost left behind the aching eye.&mdash;</br>Deck'd was the scene with beauties all its own,</br>Whose pow'rful charms each critic glance defy;</br>And on its topmost height, the regal throne</br>Of this romantic realm, stood Avon's Bard alone.", "Alone he stood &mdash; for there was none but he</br>On such a fearful precipice could stand;</br>Careless he stood, from fear and danger free,</br>And wav'd with ease that more than magic wand,</br>Whose pond'rous weight would numb each other hand;</br>For who like him could fairy chaplets twine,</br>Could paint with living hues the airy band</br>Of shapes infernal and of forms divine,</br>Or dive so wond'rous deep in Fancy's golden mine?", "Reluctant rising from their nether skies,</br>A troop of griesly ghosts before him stood,</br>With iron teeth and staring stony eyes,</br>Demons and fiends, and all the hellish brood</br>Which Fancy figures in her trembling mood;</br>Around his head those elves and spirits flew,</br>Who taste on earth of heav'n's ambrosial food,</br>Who suck with bees the cowslip's honey due,</br>And steal, to make them coats, the rainbow's brilliant hue.", "There on her car sate Mab the fairy queen,</br>And dreams of various hue around her flung;</br>Her coachman, merry Puck, array'd in green,</br>Before her on the nut-built chariot hung,</br>And all his knavish tricks and frolics sung.</br>There was the witch's child, who ne'er unclos'd</br>His brutal lips but forth a curse there sprung;</br>And Ariel quaint, of other mold compos'd,</br>Who trode the winter wind, and in the gale repos'd.</br>"]
