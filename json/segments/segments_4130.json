["Where Midhurst rears her white-wash'd tow'r on high,</br>Once Mibu call'd, or ancient poets lie,</br>Two servants there, I heard the pleasing strain,</br>Both lov'd and loving, talk'd with might and main:</br>One from the turtle took her name so bright:</br>William, the pride of swains, whose charming voice</br>Made the long hall and empty court rejoice.", "WILLIAM.</br>Sweet are the fields, and sweet the crowing cock,</br>And sweeter still the nap till eight o'clock:</br>To eat fat mutton's sweet, and drink the while;</br>But sweeter than them all is Turtle's smile.", "TURTLE.</br>Me too the fields delight, and me the street,</br>When Midhurst fair invites her youth to meet:</br>Sweet to forget what we are told to do;</br>But none of these in half so sweet as you.", "WILLIAM.</br>I serve a master good without pretence,</br>Of polish'd manners and of polish'd sense,</br>Whose secret acts the poor of Midhurst own;</br>Yet would I leave them all, and follow thee alone.", "TURTLE.</br>A beauteous mistress I, of manners mild,</br>Whom Virtue honours as her favour'd child:</br>Whose gentle words no venom'd malice bear,</br>To rob of character the neighb'ring fair.</br>Ah!  I could stand from morn to dewy eve,</br>And sing untir'd, nor yet the subject leave.", "AMBO.</br>Yet would we leave them all for love so true,</br>And like the Turtle live, and like the Turtle woo.</br>"]
