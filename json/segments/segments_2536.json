["When Spring, with scanty vest and maiden smile,</br>Leads on the youthful months and coming year,</br>Her tears of morning dew</br>Shall wet thy death-bed cold.", "When jocund Summer with her honied breath</br>Sweet'ning the golden grain and blithsome gale,</br>Displays her sun-burnt face</br>Beneath the hat of straw;", "When sober Autumn with lack-lustre eye</br>Shakes with a chiding blast the yellow leaf,</br>And hears the woodman's song,</br>And early sportsman's foot;", "The Lily's hanging head, the Pansy pale,</br>(Poor Fancy's lowly followers) in meek</br>Attire, shall deck thy turf,</br>And withering lie with thee.", "And naked Winter like a pilgrim grey</br>Of veriest rude aspect and joyless brow,</br>Calls for the carol wild</br>And trims the social fire;", "Remembrance oft in pity's willing ear,</br>Shall toll at silent eve thy pensive knell,</br>And tell to after-days</br>Thy tale, thy luckless tale.</br>"]
