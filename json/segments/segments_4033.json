["Your Shepherd, dear Phillis, invites to be gay,</br>To range thro' the meadows and fields;</br>To cull the sweet flow'rets that blossom in May,</br>And taste all the pleasures it yields.", "The daisy, the primrose, and violet too,</br>Their charms in profusion disclose;</br>And soon in succession, delighted, you'll view</br>The blush of the opening rose.", "How sweet sing the sky-larks, saluting the day,</br>When straining their musical throats!</br>And blackbirds and linnets soon join on each spray,</br>To warble their various notes.", "Near my cottage this harmony frequently reigns</br>(Oh sure, 'tis delightful to tell!)</br>What life can compare with a life on the plains,</br>Where peace and tranquility dwell!", "Each eve, to enliven the innocent scene,</br>The nymphs and the shepherds advance;</br>And lads with their lasses all meet on the green,</br>To join in the rustical dance.", "Then come, my dear Phillis, enjoy this retreat,</br>Come share these engaging delights;</br>Nor envy the proud, the ambitious, or great:&mdash;</br>Your shepherd it is that invites.</br>"]
