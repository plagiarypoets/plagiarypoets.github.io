["The Sun upon the western hills was gone,</br>That guard thy vales of beauty, Palestine,</br>Now flaming like a golden, fiery zone,</br>The Crescent on the eastern Heaven, supine,</br>Hung on the purple horizontal line.</br>Up Padanaram's height, abrupt and bare,</br>A Pilgrim toil'd, and oft on day's decline</br>Look'd pale, then paused for eve's delicious air,</br>The summit gain'd, he knelt, and breathed his evening prayer.", "He spread his cloak, and slumber'd.  Darkness fell</br>Upon the twilight hills.  A sudden sound</br>Of silver trumpets o'er him seem'd to swell.</br>Clouds heavy with the tempest gather'd round,</br>Yet was the whirlwind in its caverns bound.</br>Still deeper rolled the darkness from on high,</br>Gigantic volume upon volume wound:</br>Above, a pillar shooting to the sky,</br>Below, an ocean spreading on incessantly.", "Voices are heard &mdash; a choir of golden strings,</br>Low winds, whose breath is loaded with the rose;</br>Then chariot-wheels, &mdash; the nearer rush of wings;</br>Pale lightning round the dark pavilion glows;</br>It thunders &mdash; The resplendent gates unclose.</br>Far as the eye can glance, o'er height o'er height,</br>Blaze fiery, waving wings, and star crowned brows,</br>Rank'd by their millions, brighter and more bright,</br>Till all is lost in one supreme, unmingled light.", "But two beside the sleeping Pilgrim stand,</br>Like cherub Kings with uplift, mighty plume,</br>Fixed, sun-bright eyes, and looks of high command:</br>They tell the Patriarch of his glorious doom,</br>Father of countless myriads, that shall come,</br>Sweeping the land, like billows of the sea,</br>Bright as the stars of Heaven from twilight's gloom,</br>Till HE is given whom Angels long to see,</br>And Israel's splendid line is crown'd with Deity.</br>"]
