["Welcome great chieftain!  Freedom's boast,</br>To Freedom's sacred land;</br>Welcome to an admiring host</br>Whose grateful hearts expand</br>With joy to hail the warrior brave,</br>Whose arm was boldly stretch'd to save</br>Their country in her darkest hour,</br>When shrinking from the oppressor's power,</br>She mourned the ruthless fate which seemed to say,</br>\"Thy freedom soon expires, crush'd in its natal day.\"", "Thy heart was gallant, young and warm,</br>Thy sword was prompt and true;</br>And midst the battle's loud alarm,</br>Thy conq'ring banners flew.</br>'Twas freedom's cause thy soul inspir'd,</br>'Twas holy zeal thy bosom fir'd,</br>When strong thy generous wrath arose,</br>And rush'd with ruin on our foes.</br>How bright the glory then thy valour won,</br>A nation's gratitude, the love of Washington!", "That sacred name, what thoughts of pride</br>Does it not yield to thee,</br>Whene'er thou think'st how side by side</br>Ye won our liberty?</br>For us, we never shall forget</br>To whom we owe that mighty debt!</br>And join'd with his immortal name,</br>Thine, living on the rolls of fame,</br>Through every age, admired and lov'd shall flow,</br>And teach each generous heart with patriot warmth to glow.", "Then welcome to the honours now</br>Our grateful hearts prepare;</br>The wreath to decorate thy brow</br>Is braided by the fair;</br>And bards have waked each tuneful shell,</br>To bid the songs of triumph swell;</br>Ten thousand thousand hearts beat high,</br>Throughout this land of liberty,</br>To tell the list'ning world with loud acclaim,</br>The glory that is due to Fayette's honour'd name.</br>"]
