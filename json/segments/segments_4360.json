["Let others sing of Battle's loud alarms,</br>Of conqu'ring heroes and defeated bands;</br>The task is mine, in more delightful strains</br>To sing a British Apple Dumpling's praise.</br>The lovely object opens to my view,</br>And on the more enraptur'd appetite</br>Excites a keener relish; Fancy's eye</br>Survey's thy charms delighted, then with speed</br>She wings her mystic flight thro' distant climes,</br>Surveys the torrid zone, Pomona's grove,</br>Where fragrant apples scent the ambient air,</br>Or hang exuberant on the loaded bow,</br>T' enrich my theme and charm each ravish'd scene.</br>Return my vagrant muse, Sumatra's fruit</br>We court not, Britain's fertile isle brings forth</br>The mellow apple:  various kinds she boasts,</br>Their names and virtues we must leave unsung,</br>These but in part thy fabric do compose.</br>Both Indies must unite their sweets, combine</br>Their choicest sweets our senses to regale.</br>The epicure, who each returning day,</br>With jaws rapacious and insatiate maw,</br>Devours potatoes, and unwholesome pork,</br>His grosser taste knows not the sweets of thee.</br>What tho' long time involved in sable pot,</br>Thou sott'ring dost endure convulsive throws?</br>Th' excruciating torture but refines</br>Thy purer essence grateful to the taste.</br>When from the reeking cavern's mouth thou'rt brought,</br>Short respite we allow thee, now with speed</br>Thou'rt plac'd conspicuous in a china vase</br>(Or sometimes dost descend to humbler delf,)</br>Whilst round thy polish'd sides redundant flows,</br>Nectareous juice in most delicious floods.</br>Oft times I've seen thee, (charming to relate)</br>Ride buoyant on the stream with head erect,</br>And honest front, float round the dish audacious;</br>But when thou boast'st a more gigantic size,</br>Enormous, massy, ample, long and huge,</br>The balmy current yields, the incumbent weight</br>Prepond'rates, and thou plum'st the spicy tide.</br>Now the quintessence of thy charms we taste</br>That baffles all description; numbers fail.</br>My languid muse resigns the arduous task,</br>Unable to recite what taste alone enjoys.</br>Let future bards enamour'd with my theme,</br>Improve my song, and echo forth thy praise.</br>"]
