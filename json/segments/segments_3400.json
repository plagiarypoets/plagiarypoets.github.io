["My heart, &mdash; my heart, &mdash; oh!  cease forevermore</br>To beat, or cease to beat thus witheringly;</br>Bring the death-slumber of the silent shore,</br>Or from these hopeless struggles set me free.</br>Oh!  what avails it thus, &mdash; alas!  to be;&mdash;</br>Thus striving with immedicable pain;&mdash;</br>Now, on the silent waters of the sea,</br>In calmness that is ominous I sleep &mdash; again,</br>When the charged cloud has burst, whelmed in the tossing main.", "My heart &mdash; my heart &mdash; alas!  for thee, my heart,</br>By each and all conflicting passions torn;&mdash;</br>And thou their battle-ground of ruin art,</br>Till the stern master passion home return;&mdash;</br>Resume the mastery, which must be borne</br>In solitude and silence, &mdash; and the groan,</br>Which wails the happiness himself hath shorn,</br>He mocks relentless from his savage throne,</br>Built on my utter wreck, &mdash; proud, ruthless, and alone.</br>"]
