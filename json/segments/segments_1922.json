["Oh, thou pale, snowy rosebud, though rent and laid low</br>By the rude hand of Power in the day of despair,</br>Yet thou still in the breasts of the loyal shalt blow,</br>Full as lovely, as fragrant, as fresh, and as fair.</br>Though our bosoms no longer may glow with the dream</br>Of royalty righted, and exiles restored,</br>Yet still they may swell with the rapturous theme</br>Of the faith they long cherished, the prince they adored;</br>And still they in silence may weep o'er the woes</br>Endured by the chieftains who bore the white rose.", "With that deep thrilling interest, where pleasure and pain</br>Contend in the bosom and struggle for sway,</br>We muse on the emblem of Loyalty vain,</br>And sigh o'er its fall on Culloden's dark day:</br>Yet the cloud that o'ershadowed the dawning so bright,</br>And obscured with its darkness the valley and heath,</br>With the beam of the meteor flashed radiance and light,</br>And illumed with its splendour the pale field of death,</br>And bright o'er the fallen its lustre arose,</br>And hallowed their sufferings, their valour and woes.", "Oh, still whilst our bosoms shall glow with the flame,</br>Which Heaven itself in its mercy inspired,</br>Shall awaken each thrill as it dwells on the fame</br>Of the heroes so loyal, devoted, admired.</br>And still the loved emblems of loyalty true</br>Shall honoured and blest in our bosoms remain,</br>And whilst its white blossoms we pensively view,</br>We behold no dishonour, or sully, or stain;</br>And ages to come shall admiring disclose,</br>The virtues and fame of the pure, snowy rose.</br>"]
