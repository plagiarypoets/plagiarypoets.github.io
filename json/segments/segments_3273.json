["Contemplation, lovely fair,</br>Far from scenes of noise and care,</br>Evermore delights to dwell</br>In the still sequester'd cell:</br>Lead me then, propitious pow'r,</br>To thy lonely, rural bow'r;</br>To the silent, shady wood,</br>To the riv'let's dimpling flood:</br>And, on summer mornings, lead</br>To the russet heath or mead:</br>To the cot's plain simple door,</br>The ploughman's peaceful, happy floor:</br>Where Phyllis brings her loaded pail,</br>And young affection lisps it's tale;</br>Lead to dusky lanes or shades,</br>Where tall oaks lift high their heads:</br>To the seat of happiness,</br>To the garden's lov'd recess;</br>Beds with pinks and roses gay,</br>The pride and boast of June and May.", "Contemplation, nymph serene,</br>Guide to lawns, or uplands green,</br>Or near the promontory's side&mdash;</br>Let me hear the roaring tide,</br>Hear old ocean's wild waves roll;&mdash;</br>On the sad knell slowly toll,</br>Or, at gloomy hour of day,</br>With me to the church-yard stray,</br>And meditate among the dead;</br>While the sexton plies his spade,</br>There peruse the time-worn stones,</br>Or, as he turns up human bones,</br>Think on what I soon must be,</br>Think on vast eternity:</br>'Till torches dissipate the gloom,</br>And the sable mourners come;</br>'Till the venerable priest,</br>In his snowy surplice dress'd,</br>Loudly begins the solemn lines,</br>And \"dust to dust,\" at length consigns.", "Hail!  matron lovely, tho' demure,</br>Ever chaste and ever pure,</br>Diffuse thy balm into my breast,</br>Bring with thee happiness and rest:</br>Sooth each melancholy sigh,</br>Teach me to live, and teach to die!</br>"]
