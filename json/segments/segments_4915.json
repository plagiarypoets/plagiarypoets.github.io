["The Praise of meaner Wits this Work like Profit brings,</br>As doth the Cuckoo's Song delight, when Philomela sings.</br>If thou hast formed right true Vertue's Face herein;</br>Vertue her self can best discern, to whom they written bin.</br>If thou hast Beauty prais'd, let her sole Looks Divine</br>Judge if ought therein be amiss, and mend it by her eyne.</br>If Chastity want ought, or Temperance her due,</br>Behold her Princely Mind aright, and write thy Queen anew.</br>Mean-while she shall perceive, how far her Vertues sore</br>Above the reach of all that live, or such as wrote of yore;</br>And thereby will excuse and favour thy Good-will,</br>Whose Vertue cannot be exprest, but by an Angel's Quill.</br>Of me no Lines are lov'd, nor Letters are of Price,</br>Of all which speak our English Tongue, but those of thy Device.</br>"]
