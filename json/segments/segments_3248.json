["If those who behold my distress,</br>The sorrow would treat as their own;</br>Not a Nymph but would pity my case,</br>Not a Swain but sincerely would moan:</br>For ever is fled from my sight,</br>My fav'rite and pride of the plain;</br>Adieu!  to all hope of delight,</br>I shall never be happy again.", "When my greatest of foes took her flight,</br>How kindly I welcom'd the morn;</br>Was exceedingly pleas'd at the sight,</br>And I wish'd she might never return.</br>But, alas!  what a damp on my joy,</br>Has cruel fate suddenly thrown,</br>Full of nothing but sadness am I,</br>Since for ever my William is gone.", "I once lost a son of that name,</br>And have never recover'd the shock;</br>He was dearer than all I could claim,</br>And as dearly belov'd by his flock.</br>When the mountaineers rush'd from the North,</br>And lawlessly wont to combine,</br>In his country's behalf he stept forth,</br>And blasted the treach'rous design.", "Since the days of his father's mild reign,</br>Whose mem'ry is truly rever'd,</br>Fond joy has forsaken the plain,</br>And nothing but murmurs are heard:</br>Of tyranny being display'd,</br>No village but loudly complains;</br>No regard to their cries have been paid,</br>And no prospect of pleasure remains.", "In so pleasant and wholesome a soil,</br>How happy its natives might be,</br>On they who their stations defile,</br>Would justice but read their decree.</br>Although to get evils redress'd,</br>In vain have they humbly implor'd;</br>Never will they contentedly rest,</br>'Till their primitive rights are restor'd.", "When my barks fully laden appear,</br>O!  think how it tortures my heart,</br>To find what are ready to steer,</br>From their moorings forbid to depart!</br>When commerce is check'd in her course,</br>My vitals feel deeply the wound;</br>Whilst he who can cure is perverse,</br>No relief for my pains can be found.</br>"]
