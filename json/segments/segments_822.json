["BOOK I.  CANTO IV.", "THE ARGUMENT.</br>The Knight of the Red-cross and Duessa arrive at the House of Pride &mdash; Description of Pride, her Palace, Idleness, Gluttony, Passion, Avarice, Envy, Wrath, and Satan, her Attendants. &mdash; The Red-cross Knight agrees to combat him on the Morrow.", "Ye valiant youths that seek for virtuous fame,</br>Noble pursuit and worthy of the soul,</br>Oh hearken to the Muse, whilst thus she sings,</br>Of Fraud and sad inconstancy beware,</br>In choice and change of her ye love the best,</br>Her virtues with the loudest trump proclaim,</br>Her frailties cover with the veil of love,</br>If faults she has, deep hide them your hearts,</br>Nor let a murmuring whisper taint her fame.", "Now had the virtuous Knight been long deceiv'd</br>By feign'd Fidess' (Duessa rightly nam'd)</br>And lest chaste Una in ill-fated hour;</br>Far forth he travell'd (Falsehood by his side,</br>Oftimes mistook for Faith) at last they saw</br>A stately palace, reaching up to Heav'n;</br>Which seem'd the residence of some great prince.</br>Thither Duessa ask'd him to retire,</br>For the long ling'ring day was almost spent.</br>This towering fabrick, beauteous to behold,</br>Spoke loud the fame of the great architect,</br>The walls were high, but neither strong nor thick,</br>And golden foil all over them display'd,</br>That with their brightness they dismay'd the sky:</br>High lifted up were many lofty towers,</br>The windows in the highest stile were wrought,</br>And bowers delightful, and upon the top</br>A golden dial told the fleeting hours:</br>Here elegance with purest taste combin'd,</br>Whate'er might strike the sense, or charm the soul;</br>Yet all was semblance; for on nought but sand </br>This building stood, and to the centre shook</br>At every breath of Heav'n:  the hinder parts,</br>Which few beheld, were ruinous and old,</br>But painted to delude:  the portals wide</br>Expanded to receive each stranger guest,</br>And charge of them was to a porter given,</br>Call'd Malvenu, who entrance ne'er refus'd,</br>A broad high way led to this stately dome,</br>And anxious crouds to see the queen repair'd;</br>Among them also came this virtuous Knight,</br>And Duessa the fraudful:  each amaz'd</br>At such o'erflowing wealth, surpassing far</br>Whate'er of courts or Persia's pride was heard.", "On a rich throne, as bright as mid-day sun,</br>There sat a royal maiden cloath'd in gold,</br>Her peerless jewells shone like Titan's rays,</br>Yet did her beauty oft assay to dim</br>Th' amazing splendor, of her glorious throne,</br>As envying herself, that with such lustre</br>Exceeding shone like Phoebus' fairest child,</br>Who did presume to guide his father's wain,</br>And steeds unwonted wild, with flaming mouths,</br>Through highest Heav'n; when of such honours proud,</br>The flashing beams dazzling his feeble eye,</br>He leaves the welkin way; his wheels inflame</br>The skies, with fire not made to burn, but shine.</br>So shone this peerless queen in royal state,</br>And look'd to Heav'n, for earth she quite abhorr'd.</br>Beneath her scornful feet a dragon lay,</br>With hideous train, and in her hand she wav'd</br>A flatt'ring mirror, where she often view'd</br>Her lovely face, in which the graces seem'd</br>To hold their empire, yet 'twas fiction all.</br>Her worthless generation who can tell?&mdash;</br>Of griesly Pluto she the daughter was,</br>And Proserpina, queen of hell, her dam;</br>Yet did her pride assume to call on Jove,</br>That thunders loud and wields the world on high,</br>As on her Father; or if any else</br>High Jove excell'd, for to the high'st she soar'd,</br>Or if ought higher were to that aspir'd:</br>Her name on earth was proud Lucifera,</br>A queen she seem'd, yet royalty had none,</br>By tyranny she rul'd, and not by law,</br>And six bad counsellors her throne upheld.", "Soon as the Knight and Duessa arriv'd,</br>Usher'd by Vanity they prostrate fell</br>At her high throne, professing loyalty:</br>With lofty eyes, half loth to look so low,</br>She bow'd disdainful, nor more grace vouchsaf'd:</br>Mean while her courtiers sought to catch their hearts,</br>With all the pomp of dress, each envying each,</br>For Duessa they knew, and with the Knight</br>Wish'd to increase their numbers, but in vain:</br>Their tinsel outsides sparkled not to him,</br>Their queen he thought too proud, nor ought admir'd.</br>Then suddenly arose the royal dame,</br>Her slaves attend, and quick her coach prepare,</br>Lo!  forth she comes, her brightness blazing high,</br>As fair Aurora in her purple pall,</br>Forth from the east to call the dawning day:</br>Lo forth she comes!  the thronging multitude</br>Annoy each other, eager to behold</br>Such blaze of glory, which attracts all hearts,</br>Save those who venerate fair Virtue's form.</br>Lo forth she comes, and to her coach ascends,</br>In gold and garlands sumptuously array'd,</br>As fresh she seem'd as Flora in her prime,</br>And wish'd to excel great Juno's golden chair,</br>Which gods beheld as she triumphant rides,</br>To Jove's high house, thro' Heav'n's brass-pav'd way,</br>Drawn of fair peacocks that excel in pride,</br>Their glitt'ring tails o'erspread with Argus' eyes:</br>But this her coach by six unequal beasts</br>Was drawn, on which her counsellers did ride.", "The guide was Idleness, the nurse of kin,</br>Upon a slothful ass by choice he went,</br>In black array'd, a holy monk he seem'd,</br>His prayer book in his hand was little read,</br>For of devotion he ne'er heeded ought,</br>His heavy head he scarcely could uphold,</br>Nor knew nor cared whether 'twas day or night;</br>Such guidance could produce no good effect:</br>Each prudent care he shunn'd, and manly toil,</br>And ev'ry work for contemplation scorn'd,</br>But Riot mark'd his life, and passion's sway</br>Had spread a burning fever thro' his veins.", "And by his side rode loathsome Gluttony,</br>Deformed creature, on a filthy swine,</br>With luxury, fill'd, his eyes with fatness swell'd,</br>Beastly he seem'd, and hated was by all:</br>In green vine leaves for coolness he was clad,</br>An ivy garland totter'd on his brow,</br>From whence the sweat fast trickled, still he eat,</br>And in his hand a boozing can he bore,</br>Of which he drank so oft he scarce could ride:</br>Intemperance fill'd him with each dire disease,</br>That more he seem'd a monster than a man.", "And next to him rode lawless Appetite,</br>Upon a bearded goat, whose rugged hair</br>And whally eyes (emblem of jealousy)</br>Seem'd like his rider chastity to scorn;</br>Nor could he ever please the virtuous fair,</br>His falsehood and his follies still he strove</br>To hide beneath a robe of beauteous green,</br>And in his hand a burning heart he held,</br>Fill'd with incentives to allure the mind,</br>His chief delight was to delude the fair,</br>Whilst wedlock's holy chains with rage he spurn'd</br>Yet did inconstancy destroy his peace</br>And Sin's dire wages tortur'd all his frame.</br>Next greedy Avarice nodding o'er his gold,</br>With watchings worn, upon a camel came,</br>Two iron coffers hung on either side,</br>With precious metal to the top up-heap'd,</br>And in his lap another heap he held;</br>Gold was his god and usury his trade,</br>All sense of right and wrong he quite forgot,</br>For he had sold himself to Vice for wealth.</br>Tho' he was verging on death's awful brink:</br>Nor ever tasted ought that life affords,</br>Of sweet or pleasant, or of social kind,</br>No friend or relative to share his stores,</br>He led a wretched life, worn out with fear,</br>His wealth was want, his plenty made him poor.</br>Fell Envy next appear'd upon a wolf,</br>Between his canker'd teeth a toad he chew'd,</br>His venomous mouth with poison all distain'd,</br>Sad at this neighbour's wealth, he wept for want</br>Of others woe, but joyn'd at thought of harm:</br>His clothes discolor'd painted full of eyes,</br>And serpents made his bosom their abode,</br>Evil was all his good, he grudg'd the chear</br>Of his compeers, and gnash'd his angry teeth</br>At the ill gotten gold which Avarice had;</br>He hated all good works, and virtuous deeds,</br>Accus'd their authors, and the motives too,</br>Nor could the muse's lyre attune his mind.", "Besides him next, upon a lion fierce:</br>(Fit emblem of his rider) vengeful Wrath</br>A burning torch he brandish'd round his head,</br>His staring eyes shot fire, his face all pale,</br>His trembling had a murderous dagger held,</br>His ragged raiment all distain'd with blood,</br>His ruffian breast endured not controul,</br>Nor recollected he what dire effects</br>Attend ungovern'd passion's lawless sway:</br>Yet num'rous mischiefs follow cruel wrath,</br>Unnatural murder, and tumultuous strife,</br>Abhorred bloodshed and unthrifty harm,</br>The rusty knife of rancour, sad despite,</br>And fretting grief the enemy of life;</br>With raging phrensies, spleens and palsies dire,</br>And all the pangs infernal spirits feel.", "Satan himself rode last, and drove the team,</br>And lash'd it on, whenever ling'ring sloth</br>A moment loiter'd on the dirty road.</br>Huge routs of joyous people shouting ran,</br>Whilst a thick fog conspir'd to dim their eyes,</br>And hide the slaughter'd thousands on the plain,</br>The votaries of vice, that late had bow'd</br>At Pride's high throne, and own'd her sway supreme.", "So forth they march'd to taste the chearing air,</br>And next Lucifera's false Duess' rode,</br>Not so the Red-cross Knight, at distance he</br>Beheld their wanton sports all unapprov'd:</br>Fed with the pleasures of the balmy fields,</br>Home they fill'd (his brother lately slain,</br>The bold Sans-Foy) he seem'd to harbour wrath</br>And nourish vengeance in his bitter mind:</br>But when he saw the Red-cross Knight (whose Page</br>Bearing the shield of slain Sans-Foy, betray'd</br>Who slew his brother) instantly he leap'd</br>And snatch'd the warlike-ensign, but the Knight</br>Rescu'd the noble prey, and strait for war</br>They both prepar'd, and shook their glittering swords,</br>And clash'd their shields:  but the great queen forbad</br>All war that day, upon eternal pain</br>Of her displeasure, and the morrow fix'd</br>To end the high dispute in equal lists:</br>Then thus the infidel the queen address'd,</br>Pardon his rashness, who, thro' grief o'erleaps</br>The bounds of reason, shame to see this Knight</br>(No knight, but traitor of the foulest stamp)</br>Who slew the bravest knight that ever fought,</br>Even stout Sans-Foy, (Oh who can then refrain!)</br>Whilst he disdainful bears his flaming shield;</br>And, to increase the victory, behold</br>His dearest love, Fidessa, he detains</br>In traitorous vassalage; he detains her now,</br>But e'er tomorrow's noon, this vengeful arm</br>(Your royal favour granted) shall require</br>That brother's death, and render blood for blood.</br>Him shortly answer'd the true Red-Cross Knight,</br>He never meant to fight with words, but swords;</br>And as a sacred pledge his gauntlet threw,</br>Next morn by combat to decide the cause:</br>The night they pass'd in joy and jollity,</br>For Gluttony was steward of the feast,</br>And pour'd profuseness round; when nature tir'd</br>And worn out with excess, sought guilty rest,</br>Then Sloth conducted them to beds of ease.", "Now when the coal-black curtains of old night</br>Had cover'd brightest sky, the warlike youths</br>In different rooms on drowsy couches laid,</br>'Gan meditate fit means of victory,</br>And false Duessa rising from her bed</br>To Sans-Joy comes in haste, whom thus she greets;</br>Ah dear Sans-Joy, next dearest to Sans-Foy,</br>Source of my hope, and cause of all my grief,</br>His image, so late slain by wicked foe</br>Revives my heart, Lo his Fidessa comes</br>To seek your grace!  to whom Sans Joy in few,</br>Say on the secret of th' labouring breast:</br>Then she in sighs, since first my heart was pierc'd</br>With love of him I mourn, I ne'er rejoic'd,</br>But for his farce endured num'rous woes,</br>At last, when I had fondly hop'd my joys</br>Were ripening quick, then was my much lov'd lord</br>By this deceiver slain, unworthy he</br>To wear his shield or hold Fidessa bound:</br>Yet now the clouds disperse, and light appears,</br>Under your beams I shall be safe from harm,</br>To you the inheritance of right belongs,</br>Let not your brother's ghost that vengeful calls</br>From Stygian shores implore your aid in vain:</br>Whereto Sans-Joy, fair lady nothing fear,</br>This valiant arm; shall sacrifice his blood,</br>And send his coward foul to darkest shades:</br>Oh but I fear, said she, the fate of war,</br>His arms and shield (they say) inchantments hold,</br>Nor was he ever forc'd to quit the field!</br>Then thus the angry knight in haste replied,</br>His valorous feats you need not now rehearse,</br>But hence and rest till morn then shall his corpse</br>Appease your rage the dowry of Sans-Foy</br>Shall too be yours:  Ah woe is me, she cry'd,</br>That is a double death, a sorrow new,</br>My proud foe's sight my troubles must increase,</br>Yet shall my secret aid still follow you.&mdash;</br>&mdash;Obedient she retir'd, nor more reply'd.</br>"]
