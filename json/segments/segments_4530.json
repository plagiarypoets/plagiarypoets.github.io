["Shout, warriors, shout, that Spain is free,</br>Your voice shall reach the flying foe,</br>The thund'ring sounds of victory</br>Shall fill their coward souls with woe!</br>Panic-struck the murderers fly,</br>Trampled in dust their bloody eagles lie;</br>Shame now pursues, where desolation led,</br>And Spain, victorious Spain, has conquered while she bled.</br>"]
