["Weave the woof, and o'er the warp,</br>Pour the many twinkling harp:</br>Near Aetolias radiant bower,</br>Let the tuneful plummage lower,</br>Such the insatiate poet's doom!", "Night comes on, with moon-crown'd lustre,</br>Binds the stars in faded cluster;</br>Careless on some dusky river,</br>Cupids ever-rattling quiver,</br>Shuttles of a vengeful loom.", "Still the Thracian spectre's car</br>Wages red a barbarous cry,</br>Thro' the fervent groves of war</br>Where her pointed triumphs die,</br>Peace, ye heart-repelling fair,</br>Lave in burnish'd tints your hair.", "Peace, O peace, mellifluous glory</br>'Midst the forests browner roar,</br>Hail each mute enamour'd story;</br>Hail each withering flame of Yore.</br>He spoke and wanton to the rugged beam,</br>With lambent robes, he swept the horror of the stream.</br>"]
