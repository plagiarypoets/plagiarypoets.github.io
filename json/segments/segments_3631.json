["Dear little plant!  that here amid the gloom</br>And chill of winter puttest forth thy flowers,</br>Why waste on dreary scenes thy tender bloom,</br>Nor spread thy beauties in more genial blowers,</br>Where neither snows descend, nor tempest lowers?</br>But all is teeming with the sweets of May,</br>Where cheerful birds sing through the lengthening hours,</br>Making, with joyous notes, the scene more gay,</br>And offering up to God the homage of their lay.", "Unlike the blossoms that in summer skies</br>Alone bud forth, and shed their fragrance round;</br>Though at thy birth the genial sun denies</br>His fostering care and warmth, thou still art found</br>Raising thy hardy stem above the ground.</br>Bleak is the prospect, and the teeming earth</br>Lies fast in Winter's icy fetters bound;</br>Hush'd is all Nature's melody and mirth,&mdash;</br>The frosts and snows of Heaven the handmaids of thy birth.", "Yet do I prize thee &mdash; love thy buds to view,</br>On the drear face of Nature, opening blow,</br>More than the fragrant flowers of richer hue</br>That on the lap of rosy Summer glow.</br>Thou are like Friendship, that, in days of woe</br>And storms of fortune, comes to cheer their gloom;</br>The smile of gladness round life's winter throw,</br>All the bright promises of joy relume,</br>And cast o'er faded hopes a faint but sweet perfume.</br>"]
