["Come ye, whose souls harmonious sounds inspire,</br>Friends to the muse, and judges of her song;</br>Who, catching from the bard his heavenly fire,</br>Soar as he soars, sublimely wrapt along;</br>Mourn, mourn your loss:  He's gone who had the art,</br>With sounds to sooth the ear, with sense to warm the heart.", "Who now shall dare to lift the sacred rod,</br>Truth's faithful guard, where vice escapes the law?</br>Who now, high-soaring to the throne of God,</br>In nature's moral cause his pen shall draw?</br>Let none pretend:  He's gone, who had the art,</br>With sounds to sooth the ear, with sense to warm the heart.", "Vice now secure, her blushless front shall raise,</br>And all her triumph be thro' Britain borne;</br>Whose worthless sons from guilt shall purchase praise,</br>Nor dread the hand that pointed them to scorn;</br>No check remains:  He's gone, who had the art,</br>With sounds to sooth the ear, with sense to warm the heart.", "Ye tuneless bards, now tire each venal quill,</br>And from the public gather idle pence;</br>Ye tasteless peers, now build and plant your fill,</br>Tho' splendor borrows not one ray from sense:</br>Fear no rebuke:  He's gone, who had the art,</br>With sounds to sooth the ear, with sense to warm the heart.", "But, come, ye chosen, ye selected few,</br>Yet next in genius, as in friendship, join'd,</br>The social virtues of his heart who knew,</br>And tasted all the beauties of his mind;</br>Drop, drop a tear:  He's gone, who had the art,</br>With sounds to charm the ear, and sense to warm the heart.", "And, O great shade!  permit thy humblest friend</br>His sigh to waft, his grateful tear to pay</br>Thy honour'd memory; and condescend</br>To hear, well-pleas'd, the weak yet well-meant lay</br>Lamenting thus:  He's gone, who had the art,</br>With sounds to sooth the ear, with sense to warm the heart.</br>"]
