["Away &mdash; away &mdash; why dost thou linger here</br>When all thy fellows o'er the sea have passed?</br>Wert thou the earliest comer of the year,</br>Loving our land, and so dost stay the last?</br>Hear'st thou no warning in the autumnal blast,</br>And is the sound of growing streams unheard?</br>Dost thou not see the woods are fading fast,</br>Whilst the dull leaves with wailful winds are stirred?&mdash;</br>Haste &mdash; haste to other climes, thou solitary bird!", "Thy coming was in lovelier skies &mdash; thy wing,</br>Long wearied, rested in delightful bowers;</br>Thou camest when the living breath of spring</br>Had filled the world with gladness and with flowers!</br>Skyward the carolling lark no longer towers:</br>Alone we hear the robin's pensive lay;</br>And from the sky of beauty, darkness lowers:</br>Thy coming was with hope &mdash; but thou dost stay</br>Midst melancholy thoughts, that dwell upon decay.", "Blessed are they who have before thee fled!</br>Their's have been all the pleasures of the prime;</br>Like those who die before their joys are dead,</br>Leaving a lovely for a lovelier clime,</br>Soaring to beautiful worlds on wings sublime!</br>Whilst thou dost mind me of their doom severe,</br>Who live to feel the winter of their time;</br>Who linger on, till not a friend is near&mdash;</br>Then fade into the grave &mdash; and go without a tear!</br>"]
