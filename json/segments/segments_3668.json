["Ah!  why to indulge my fond mind,</br>Despair thus in solitude seek,</br>My hair flowing loose in the wind,</br>And faded the rose on my cheek.", "No more to yon favourite hill</br>I fly to salute the gay morn;</br>My lambkins left quite to their will,</br>Like me now they wander forlorn.", "So chang'd is the once pleasant glade,</br>It hateful appears in my eyes,</br>While the breeze thro' the whisp'ring shade</br>Soft murmuring echoes my sighs.", "No more I prepare for the dance,</br>No more at the tabret rejoice;</br>A song if I hear now by chance,</br>I weep at the sound of the voice.", "For ah!  my lov'd shepherd is gone,</br>'Twas he that gave grace to my steps;</br>His presence inspir'd the glad song</br>That so oft wou'd escape from my lips.", "When he with my hand in his press'd,</br>A story of love wou'd recite,</br>My eyes a fond answer confess'd,</br>And sparkl'd with conscious delight.", "And when his fond tales to repeat,</br>We've stray'd by the light of the moon,</br>I never once dreamt of deceit,</br>Or his vows wou'd be broken so soon.", "Alas!  to another he's flown,</br>His heart I no longer possess;</br>But oh!  with confusion I own,</br>I still cannot love him the less.", "But adieu to content, then, my soul,</br>To seek after peace is in vain,</br>My passion I cannot controul,</br>'Tis death must extinguish the flame.</br>"]
