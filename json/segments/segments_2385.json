["The sweep majestic of the river's brow,</br>Which far above extends from shore to shore&mdash;</br>(It glows in memory's magic mirror now,)</br>Heaven's bright blue arch rising behind and o'er&mdash;</br>The Lakesprung torrents &mdash; as with ceaseless roar,</br>Over the everlasting rocks they roll,</br>Forever to the dizzy leap before&mdash;</br>All rush at once upon the startled soul,</br>At the first transient glance your eye throws o'er the whole.", "But sight is mingled at the heart with sound&mdash;</br>The loud, the deafening thunder of the fall,</br>Which seems at first all feeling to confound,</br>The brain to madden and the breast appal,</br>And spread annihilation over all!&mdash;</br>The dazzling whiteness of the sheeted foam,</br>Which to the eye seems like a snowbuilt wall,</br>On which is reared a bright Cerulean dome,</br>That Poets well might take for fancy's airy home;&mdash;", "The clouds of rising and dissolving spray,</br>Which wave and wanton in the gusty wind,</br>On which the sunbeams hold their magic play,</br>Painting gay rainbows of each glorious kind,</br>That change their shape and colour, like the mind</br>Of soft and ductile youth, with every scene,</br>Of light and shade &mdash; now swelling unconfin'd,</br>In matchless beauty with resplendent sheen&mdash;</br>Now bursting &mdash; leaving but the black abyss between;&mdash;", "The dark and dripping cliffs which overhead,</br>Rise like the warbuilt towers of ancient time,</br>Breathing defiance, and inspiring dread,</br>Which echo back with emphasis sublime,</br>The cataract's awful sounds, in measur'd chime,</br>Rolling along the deep and distant pass,</br>Until at length the bloodstain'd heights they climb,</br>Where swell'd the roar of battle &mdash; when, alas!</br>Our country's sons and foes fell in one mingled mass;&mdash;", "And the still darker torrent at your feet,</br>Whose greenwreath'd floods boil up from the abyss,</br>To whose unfathom'd depths, in one broad sheet,</br>The thundering fell &mdash; whose tides with horrid hiss,</br>Like venom'd serpents vast, do seem, I wis,</br>Writhing in pain, and madly rushing by,</br>Towards far Ontario's bed: &mdash; All &mdash; all, of this,</br>Must have struck on the heart &mdash; the ear &mdash; the eye&mdash;</br>To wake the burning soul of its sublimity.", "O!  I have thought &mdash; and thought did well beseem</br>A scene so fraught with wondrous majesty&mdash;</br>If with such wonders His creation teem,</br>What must the glory of the Author be!</br>With what deep reverence and humility,</br>Ought we to bow before His mighty hand!&mdash;</br>Lord of Creation and Eternity!</br>Shall human pride not quail at His command?</br>The thunder of His power, O who can understand!</br>"]
