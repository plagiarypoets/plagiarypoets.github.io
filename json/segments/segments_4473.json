["Things of high import I in thine ears,</br>Dear child, though now thou may'st not feel their power,</br>But hoard them up and in thy coming years</br>Forget them not, and when earth's tempests lower,</br>A talisman unto thee shall they be,</br>To give thy weak arm strength, to make thy dim eye see.", "Seek TRUTH, that pure celestial Truth &mdash; whose birth</br>Was in the heaven of heavens, clear, sacred, shrined,</br>In reason's light.  Not oft she visits earth,</br>But her majestic port, the willing mind,</br>Through faith, may sometimes see.  Give her thy soul,</br>Nor faint, though error's surges loudly 'gainst thee roll.", "Be FREE. &mdash; Not chiefly from the iron chain,</br>But from the one which passion forges &mdash; be</br>The master of thyself.  If lost, regain</br>The rule o'er chance, sense, circumstance.  Be free.</br>Trample thy proud lusts proudly 'neath thy feet,</br>And stand erect, as for a heaven-born one is meet.", "Seek VIRTUE.  Wear her armour to the fight;</br>Then, as a wrestler gathers strength from strife,</br>Shalt thou be nerved to a more vigorous might</br>By each contending turbulent ill of life.</br>Seek virtue. &mdash; She alone is all divine;</br>And having found, be strong, in God's own strength and thine.", "TRUTH &mdash; FREEDOM &mdash; VIRTUE &mdash; these, dear child, have power,</br>If rightly cherished, to uphold, sustain,</br>And bless thy spirit, in its darkest hour;</br>Neglect them &mdash; thy celestial gifts are vain&mdash;</br>In dust shall thy weak wing be dragged and soil'd;</br>Thy soul be crushed 'neath gaudes for which it basely toil'd.</br>"]
