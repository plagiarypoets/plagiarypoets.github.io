["When Corydon left the sweet vale,</br>Where first he beheld the fair light,</br>Soft sorrows were heard in the gale,</br>And sighs broke the silence of night.", "It was not the grace of his form,</br>Nor his skill when he pip'd on his reed,</br>Which thus could the villagers charm,</br>Which won their hearts for his meed:", "'Twas that Wit, which, so sportive and gay,</br>By Good-nature was ever restrain'd;</br>'Twas that mind, which in youth's slipp'ry way</br>By Honour and Truth was sustain'd.", "Now the ocean our Corydon ploughs;</br>Now a city receives the lov'd youth:</br>But faithful for aye be his vows</br>To Good-nature and Honour and Truth.</br>"]
