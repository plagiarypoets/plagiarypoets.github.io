["Now cease the sad complaining strain,</br>Now hush'd be PITY'S tender sigh,</br>While Memory wakes her fairy train,</br>And young delight sits laughing by;</br>Return, each hour of rosy hue,</br>In wreathy smiles, and garlands gay,</br>As when on playful wing ye flew,</br>When every month was blithe as May;</br>When young Invention wak'd his mimic powers,</br>And Genius, wand'ring wild, sigh'd for enchanted bowers.", "Then too in antic vestment dress'd,</br>Pastime would blithsome trip along,</br>Throwing around the gibe, or jest,</br>Satire enrhymed, or simple song,</br>And merry Mischief oft would weave</br>His wanton tricks for little hearts,</br>Nor love his tender votary grieve,</br>Soft were his hands, nor keen his darts:</br>While Friendship felt th' enthusiast's glow,</br>Would give her half of bliss, and take her share of woe.", "And though around my youthful spring</br>Many a low'ring storm might rise,</br>Hope her soul-soothing strain would sing,</br>And quickly brightened up the skies;</br>How sweetly pass'd my youth's gay prime!</br>For not untuneful was my tongue;</br>And as I tried the classic rhyme,</br>The critic school-boy prais'd my song.</br>Nor did mine eye not catch the splendid ray,</br>That promis'd fair to gild Ambition's distant day.", "Ah!  pleasing, gloomy, cloister shade,</br>Still, still this wavering breast inspire!</br>Here lost in rapturous trance I stray'd,</br>Here view'd with horror visions dire:</br>For soon as day dark-veil'd his head,</br>With hollow cheek, and haggard eye,</br>Pale ghosts would flit from cold death-bed,</br>And stalk with step terrific by:</br>Till the young heart would freeze with wild affright,</br>And store the dismal tale to cheer a winter's night.", "Yet ah!  what means the silent tear?</br>Why e'en mid joy this bosom heave?</br>Ye long-lost scenes, enchantments dear?</br>Lo!  now I wander o'er your grave.</br>&mdash;Yet fly ye hours of rosy hue,</br>And bear away the bloom of years!</br>And quick succeed ye sickly crew,</br>Of doubts and pains of hopes and fears!</br>Still will I ponder Fate's unalter'd plan:</br>Nor, tracing back the Child, forget that I am Man.</br>"]
