["Of all the various lots around the ball,</br>Which Fate to man distributes, absolute;</br>Avert, ye gods!  that of the Muse's son,</br>Curs'd with dire poverty!  poor hungry wretch!</br>What shall he do for life?  he cannot work</br>With manual labour:  Shall those sacred hands,</br>That brought the counsels of the gods to light;</br>Shall that inspired tongue, which ev'ry muse</br>Has touch'd divine, to charm the sons of men:</br>These hallow'd organs!  these!  be prostitute</br>To the vile service of some fool in pow'r,</br>All his behests submissive to perform,</br>Howe'er to him ingrateful?  Oh!  he scorns</br>Th' ignoble thought; with generous disdain,</br>More eligible deeming it to starve,</br>Like his fam'd ancestors renown'd in verse,</br>Than poorly bend to be another's slave,&mdash;</br>Than feed and fatten in obscurity.</br>&mdash;These are his firm resolves, which fate nor time,</br>Nor poverty can shake.  Exalted high</br>In garret vile he lives; with remnants hung</br>Of tapestry:  But oh!  precarious state</br>Of this vain transient world!  all pow'rful time!</br>What dost thou not subdue?  See what a chasm</br>Gapes wide, tremendous!  See where Saul enrag'd,</br>High on his throne, encompass'd by his guards,</br>With levell'd spear, and arm extended sits,</br>Ready to pierce old Jesse's valiant son,</br>Spoil'd of his nose! &mdash; around in tott'ring ranks,</br>On shelves pulverulent, majestick stands</br>His library; in ragged plight, and old;</br>Replete with many a load of criticism,</br>Elab'rate products of the midnight toil</br>Of Belgian brains; snatch'd from the deadly hands</br>Of murd'rous grocer, or the careful wight,</br>Who vends the plant, that clads the happy shore</br>Of Indian Patomack; which citizens</br>In balmy fumes exhale, when, o'er a pot</br>Of sage-inspiring coffee, they dispose</br>Of kings and crowns, and settle Europe's fate.", "Elsewhere the dome is fill'd with various heaps</br>Of old domestick lumber; that huge chair</br>Has seen six monarchs fill the British throne:</br>Here a broad massy table stands, o'erspread</br>With ink and pens, and scrolls replete with rhyme:</br>Chests, stools, old rasors, fractur'd jarrs half full</br>Of muddy Zythum, sour and spiritless:</br>Fragments of verse, hose, sandals, utensils</br>Of various fashion, and of various use,</br>With friendly influence hide the sable floor.", "This is the bard's musaeum, this the fane</br>To Phoebus sacred, and th' Aonian maids:</br>But oh!  it stabs his heart, that niggard fate</br>To him such small measure should dispense</br>Her better gifts:  to him!  whose gen'rous soul</br>Could relish, with as fine an elegance,</br>The golden joys of grandeur, and of wealth;</br>He who could tyrannize o'er mental slaves,</br>Or grace a gilded coronet with a mien,</br>Grand as the haughtiest Timon of them all.&mdash;", "But 'tis in vain to rave at destiny,</br>Here he must rest and brook the best he can,</br>To live remote from grandeur, learning, wit;</br>Immur'd amongst th' ignoble, vulgar herd,</br>Of lowest intellect; whose stupid souls</br>But half inform their bodies; brains of lead</br>And tongues of slander:  whose insensate breasts</br>Ne'er felt the rapt'rous, soul-entrancing fire</br>Of the coelestial muse; whose savage ears</br>Ne'er heard the sacred rules, nor ev'n the names</br>Of the Venusian bard, or critic sage</br>Full-fam'd of Stagyra:  Whose clam'rous tongues</br>Stun the tormented ear with colloquy,</br>Vociferate, trivial, or impertinent;</br>Replete with boorish scandal:  Yet, alas!</br>This, this!  he must endure, or muse alone,</br>Pensive and moping o'er the stubborn rhyme,</br>Or line imperfect &mdash; No!  the door is free,</br>And calls him to evade their deaf'ning clang,</br>By private ambulation; &mdash; 'tis resolv'd:</br>Off from his waist he throws the tatter'd gown,</br>Behold with indignation; and unloads</br>His pericranium of the weighty cap,</br>With sweat and grease discolour'd; then explores</br>The spacious chest, and from its hallow womb</br>Draws his best robe, yet not from tincture free</br>Of age's rev'rend russet, scant and bare;</br>Then down his meagre visage waving flows</br>The shadowy perruque; crown'd with gummy hat</br>Clean brush'd; a cane supports him.  Thus equip'd</br>He sallies forth; swift traverses the streets,</br>And seeks the lonely walk; \"Hail sylvan scenes,</br>Ye groves, ye vallies, ye meand'ring brooks</br>Admit me to your joys,\" in rapt'rous phrase,</br>Loud he exclaims; while with th' inspiring Muse</br>His bosom labours; and all other thoughts,</br>Pleasure and wealth, and poverty itself,</br>Before her influence vanish.  Rapt in thought,</br>Fancy presents before his ravish'd eyes</br>Distant prosperity, upon his page</br>With transport dwelling; while bright learning's sons</br>That ages hence must tread this earthly ball,</br>Indignant seem to curse the thankless age,</br>That starv'd such merit.  Meantime swallow'd up</br>In meditation deep, he wanders on,</br>Unweeting of his way. &mdash; But ah!  he starts!</br>With sudden fright!  his glaring eye-balls roll,</br>Pale turn his cheeks, and shake his loosen'd joints,</br>His cogitations vanish in the air,</br>Like painted bubbles, or a morning dream.</br>Behold the cause!  see!  thro' the opening glade,</br>With rosy visage, and abdomen grand,</br>A cit, a dun! &mdash; As in Apulia's wilds,</br>Or where the Thracian Hebrus rolls his wave,</br>A heedless kid, disportive, roves around,</br>Unheeding, till upon the hideous cave</br>Of the dire wolf she treads; half-dead she views</br>His bloodshot eye-balls, and his dreadful fangs,</br>And swift as Eurus from the monster flies.</br>So fares the trembling bard; amas'd he turns,</br>Scarce by his legs upborn; yet fear supplies</br>The place of strength; straight home he bends his course,</br>Nor looks behind him till he safe regain</br>His faithful citadel; there spent, fatigu'd,</br>He lays him down to ease his heaving lungs,</br>Quaking, and of his safety scarce convinc'd.</br>Soon as the Panick leaves his panting breast,</br>Down to the Muse's sacred rites he sits,</br>Volumes pil'd round him; see!  upon his brow</br>Perplex'd anxiety, and struggling thought,</br>Painful as female throes:  whether the bard</br>Display the deeds of heroes; or the fall</br>Of vice, in lay dramatick; or expand</br>The lyrick wing; or in elegiac strains</br>Lament the fair; or dash the stubborn age,</br>With laughing satire, or in rural scenes</br>With shepherds sport; or rack his hard-bound brains</br>For th' unexpected turn.  Arachne so,</br>In dusty kitchen corner, from her bowels</br>Spins the fine web; but spins with better fate,</br>Than the poor bard:  she!  caitiff!  spreads her snares,</br>And with their aid enjoys luxurious life,</br>Bloated with fat of insects, flesh'd in blood:</br>He!  hard, hard!  lot!  for all his toil and care,</br>And painful watchings, scarce protracts a while</br>His meagre, hungry days!  ungrateful world!</br>If with his drama he adorn the stage;</br>No worth-discerning concourse pays the charge,</br>Or of the orchestra, or th' enlight'ning torch.</br>He who supports the luxury and pride</br>Of craving Lais; he!  whose carnage fills</br>Dogs, eagles, lyons; has not yet enough,</br>Wherewith to satisfy the greedier maw</br>Of that most rav'nous, that devouring beast,</br>Yclep'd a poet.  What new Halifax,</br>What Somers, or what Dorset can'st thou find,</br>Thou hungry mortal?  break, wretch, break thy quill,</br>Blot out the study'd image; to the flames</br>Commit the Stag'rite; leave this thankless trade;</br>Erect some pedling stall, with trinkets stock'd,</br>There earn thy daily half-pence, nor again</br>Trust the false Muse:  So shall the cleanly meal</br>Repel intruding hunger. &mdash; Oh!  'tis vain,</br>The friendly admonition's all in vain;</br>The scribbling itch has seiz'd him, he is lost</br>To all advice; and starves for starving's sake.", "Thus sung the sportful Muse, in mirthful mood,</br>Indulging gay the frolick vein of youth;</br>But, oh!  ye gods, avert th' impending stroke</br>This luckless omen threatens!  hark!  methinks,</br>I hear my better angel cry, \"Retreat,</br>Rash youth!  in time retreat!  let those poor bards,</br>Who slighted all, all!  for the flatt'ring Muse,</br>Yet curs'd with pining want, as landmarks stand,</br>To warn thee from the service of th' ingrate.\"</br>"]
