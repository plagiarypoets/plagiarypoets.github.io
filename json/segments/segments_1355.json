["Placid and calm, the ev'ning shades descend,</br>And tranquil night draws on with sober pace;</br>Bright from the east what various colours blend,</br>Their burnish'd tints where Phoebus ends his race;</br>While, in a cloud, fair Dian shrouds her face,</br>Nor draws the veil till night assumes her reign;</br>But then shines forth, and beams her wonted grace,</br>Bright o'er each valley and each flowery plain,</br>Dispels dark horror from the silent night,</br>Beams peace in solitude and soft delight.", "How sweet to wander to the woodland glade!</br>How sweet the uplands and each flowery dell!</br>How sweet, while shrouded in the placid shade,</br>To hear the strains of lonely philomel!</br>While active Fancy works her potent spell,</br>And quick Imagination lends her power,</br>To hear fair Echo sound her magic shell,</br>That breathes the requiem of the parting hour!</br>The tinkling wether homeward leads the flock,</br>And o'er the vallies sounds the village clock.", "Ye sons of Pleasure, say the glittering crowd</br>That pass the hours of life in Folly's train;</br>Say, Fortune's favourites; say, ye pamper'd proud,</br>Such real enjoyments do ye ever gain?</br>Say, can your search of Pleasure e'er obtain</br>Such calm contentment and such tranquil joys?</br>Or midst your riots one short hour obtain,</br>Deprived of every thought that Peace annoys?</br>Ah, much I doubt, that Pleasure's glittering prize</br>You search in vain:  the fair Delusion flies.", "Night's curtain draws, and Sol has sunk to rest:</br>The Queen of Night assumes her glorious reign:</br>Fast fly the colours from the glimmering west,</br>And Luna's beams spread o'er each hill and plain:</br>My humble cot once more will I regain,</br>Content and Pleasure reigning in my heart.</br>Oh may they ever in my breast remain,</br>And heal each wound that's made by sorrow's dart;</br>And may my eve of life like this be found,</br>With peace, sweet pleasure, and contentment crown'd.</br>"]
