["Hallowed by sorrow &mdash; wept by million eyes,</br>The Queen of England's heart sinks in the grave;</br>Last link of old and lofty ancestries,</br>Descendant of the kingly and the brave!</br>To Caroline of Brunswick gave</br>No common fire of soul and strength of frame;</br>Yet that strength sank, no human aid could save&mdash;</br>And that soul quail'd which wrongs alone could tame;&mdash;</br>Oh, shame on her false friends &mdash; on her stern foemen shame!", "Shame on her false friends, who, for paltry bribes,</br>Deserted honour, truth, and innocence,</br>And mingled with the sleek and servile tribes,</br>Who can with all but their base gains dispense;</br>'Gainst whom th' oppressed can have no sure defence,</br>And in whose favour the dark shield of power</br>Is lifted over, so to recompense</br>The fawning crouches of the royal power,</br>The heartless sycophants of Fortune's shining hour.", "Shame on her foemen! &mdash; was there nought to soothe,</br>In woman's gentle name, their causeless rage?</br>A woman, tortured from her very youth,</br>Even till her hair was silvered o'er by age;</br>Oppressed and slandered through life's every stage!</br>Foul stain on Albion's 'scutcheon! &mdash; a disgrace</br>That will stand darkly on its record's page.&mdash;</br>Oh, had she lived for kindness to erase</br>Of all her early pangs the deep-indented trace,", "It had been happier for all; &mdash; but she</br>Has left us &mdash; and the hour that was her last,</br>Saw none of kin &mdash; no tie of family</br>To soothe her wounded spirit as it past</br>From this cold scene of sorrows that had cast</br>A cloud upon her life that darkened then;</br>No child was there &mdash; no husband with kind haste</br>To calm her in that dread hour's trying pain,</br>When all but such a love is worthless, weak, and vain.", "Yes, she has left us! &mdash; long her soul opposed,</br>With gallant firmness, deep indignity;</br>But all is over now, &mdash; the scene is closed,</br>And this ill-fated Queen no more shall be</br>The victim of her foe's malignity;</br>Love need no longer sigh &mdash; or fate be glad;</br>She soars above all love or enmity,</br>And her worst foe must own, if faults she had;</br>She had been deeply wrong'd, &mdash; nor died as die the bad.", "The only treasure that she still had left,</br>She died possess'd of &mdash; all a nation's love!</br>Of this proud boon she could not be bereft,</br>Although to wreck this last hope Malice strove;&mdash;</br>She died possessing what alone must prove</br>The virtues of her character, &mdash; the true</br>And tried affection of those who, above</br>All others, knew and served her best &mdash; the few</br>Who clung to her unchang'd, thro' changes sad and new.", "She sank with gentleness into the grave</br>Which lengthen'd sorrows had prepared for her;</br>And long will be lamented by the brave</br>And good, who know that all who live must err,&mdash;</br>And who protected the lone wanderer,</br>When there were none beside her rights to guard;</br>And when their fearless virtue could confer</br>But danger on themselves &mdash; the sure reward</br>Of all who seek the course of tyrants to retard.", "Peace to her spirit! &mdash; and in lofty places</br>May her sad fate a warning lesson be!</br>So she, \"whose virtues, talents, gentle graces,</br>Were formed to charm and win society,\"</br>But whom deep griefs pursued unceasingly,</br>Will not have borne her weight of woe in vain;</br>May monarchs in her fate a lesson see,</br>Which here to trace may not befit this strain,</br>But which they ought to feel and ponder o'er in pain!</br>"]
