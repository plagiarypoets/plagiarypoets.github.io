["Ye shepherds who pipe on the plain,</br>A moment attend to my verse;</br>Yet vain the attempt to explain,</br>How I mourn'd o'er poor Cunningham's hearse.", "Ye virgins, who grace the gay green,</br>Despondence befits ye full well,</br>For never on earth was e'er seen,</br>A shepherd who lov'd you so well.", "His song ever turn'd in your praise,</br>Your charms none so well did rehearse,</br>His Delia's, his Phillis's praise,</br>Harmoniously flow'd in his verse.", "Then pick, oh ye nymphs and ye swains,</br>Of flowrets the fairest and best,</br>With the pride that enamels your plains,</br>Let the grave of your poet be drest.", "For ah!  he was gentle and mild,</br>His manners were artless and sweet,</br>The graces beam'd forth in his mind,</br>In his breast ev'ry virtue did meet.", "But why stand we silently here?</br>To his tomb move we gently along;</br>And deck his soft sod with a tear,</br>Who was peerless in elegant song.</br>"]
