["Dear Stella, thou'rt friendly and kind;</br>My thanks, like fair Truth, are sincere:</br>I could almost say, curse on my mind,</br>If Ingratitude e'er harbour'd there!", "The praises you're pleas'd to bestow,</br>Are too high for so humble a swain:</br>But your friendship has taught them to flow,</br>For my love to the Pride of the plain.", "Believe me, I highly admire</br>Your goodness and candour conjoin'd:</br>O would ev'ry nymph but aspire</br>At such true elevation of mind!", "Since my friendship so worthy you deem,</br>Your's gives a reciprocal joy:</br>The friendship that's built on esteem,</br>Is the friendship that never can cloy.", "Gentle STELLA shall always be nigh,</br>Tho' distant as far as the Pole;</br>My regard will all distance defy;</br>Nor can time my affection controul.", "Be each tender endearment to you,</br>In conjugal union join'd:</br>May your swain as the turtle be true;</br>May your offspring be gentle and kind.", "Tune often your sweet flowing lays,</br>For your tears will serenely be spent;</br>The Muses have crown'd you with bays,</br>And virtue has giv'n you content.", "Blest Wisdom thy paths will bestrew</br>With joy-buds of virtuous desire:</br>May ye late to the world bid adieu,</br>Then join the celestial choir.</br>"]
