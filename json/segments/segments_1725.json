["Child of the wintry hour!  ah!  doom'd to trust</br>Thy tender beauties to inclement skies!</br>First off'ring of the year,</br>And harbinger of Spring!</br>Cradl'd in friendly greens, how pensive droops</br>Thy nodding head!  while in thy bashful eye,</br>As mournful of thy fate,</br>Hangs sad a pearly tear.", "Companion of Adversity!  like thee,</br>To dangers rough consign'd, the new-dropt lamb,</br>With unstain'd fleece and soft,</br>Presses thy verdant bank.</br>Alas!  in this bad world, nor Innocence</br>Secures from biting Slander's pois'nous tooth,</br>Nor Gentleness itself,</br>Her virgin sister meek.", "The temper mild, that knows not how to frown,</br>Nor of harsh rule the sceptre how to wield,</br>Is form'd to sink before</br>The boist'rous Passions rage.</br>Alas!  like thee, poor injur'd Flavia bloom'd,</br>The sweetest bud of unsuspicious youth!</br>Alas!  like thee, all purity,</br>Like thee, to storms consign'd.", "But ah!  she felt the rude unpitying breath</br>Of Malice, keener than the wintry winds;</br>And shrunk beneath the blast</br>That never, never spares.</br>Poor early victim of its pow'r, she sunk</br>Pitied, believ'd, and mourn'd, alas!  to late;</br>Chill'd by the icy touch</br>And early foot of Death.", "Oft' as thy chaste, thy unassuming face</br>Shall deck the morning of the nascent year,</br>This wounded breast shall heave</br>With pangs of cureless grief:</br>When painful Mem'ry tells how soon she fell,</br>And hapless pass'd, like thee, fair spotless flow'r!</br>Her little life, forlorn,</br>Amid the wilds of fate.</br>"]
