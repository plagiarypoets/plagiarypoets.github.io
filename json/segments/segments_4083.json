["'Tis Time:  I feel him knocking at my heart,</br>And he shall hold his unresisted sway</br>Till yonder planets from their orbits start,</br>And this huge sepulchre, the Earth, decay.</br>Oh!  he has clouded many a festive day</br>With angry feuds or Jealousy's mistrust;</br>He strikes the blood-stained tyrant with dismay,</br>And buries ancient palaces in dust;</br>Wreathing vile weeds around the sculptur'd bust.</br>The mightiest dynasties before him fall,</br>As steel is canker'd by corrosive rust,</br>Or as the storm hurls down some pond'rous wall.</br>Yet, lo!  the day, &mdash; the awful day of doom</br>Shall bury Time, &mdash; the peopler of the tomb.</br>"]
