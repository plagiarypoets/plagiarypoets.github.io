["Lest that the feeble heart of suff'ring man,</br>Too low should sink beneath some keen distress;</br>Lest fell Despair, in league with pungent Pain,</br>Should overwhelm us in their wild excess;</br>Kind Hope, her daughter Patience sends from high,</br>To soothe each heart-felt woe, to wipe each trickling eye.", "Hail, bless'd Divinity!  kind Patience, hail!</br>Soft-handed, meek-ey'd maid, whose powerful breath,</br>And strong persuasive eloquence prevail,</br>Against all ills of life, all tears of death:</br>Come lenient Virtue!  spread thy healing wing,</br>And gently calm my breast, whilst I thy praises sing.", "In all this toilsome round, and maze of life,</br>Where follies vex, or dulness pert annoys,</br>Where teazing trifles end in serious strife,</br>Where pelf can bribe, when worth neglected lies;</br>What honest spirit would not burst with rage,</br>If Patience lent not aid his passion to assuage!", "No state or rank but must to Patience bow:</br>The tradesman must have Patience for his bill;</br>He must have Patience who to law will go,</br>And if he lose his right, more Patience still:</br>Yea, to prevent, or heal full many a strife,</br>How oft, how long, must man have Patience with his wife!", "An ample Patience should their hopes sustain,</br>Who dare the mineral regions to explore;</br>Invading earth's recesses deep, to gain,</br>By toil and hazard, her metallic store.</br>Firm Patience too should well support his mind,</br>Whose ships vast oceans cross, the sport of waves and wind.", "When the shrill, cackling, long-winded dame,</br>Her tedious, vague, unmeaning tale repeats;</br>Confus'd, and wand'ring round and round her theme,</br>Till lost, and puzzl'd, she the chain forgets;</br>Yet still talk on with unabating speed,</br>Ye Gods!  who hears her out, must Patience have indeed.", "And so, when some lack-learning smug divine,</br>In solemn dulness veil'd, unfolds his text,</br>Dark and more dark grows what he should define,</br>And ev'ry sentence more and more perplext;</br>Yet still he blunders on the same blind course,</br>Teaching his weary'd hearers Patience upon force.", "Without bold Patience, who could ever bear</br>To court the great, and cringe with forced smile;</br>Fed with some promises, or speeches fair,</br>Meant their too easy credence to beguile:</br>While still they wait, tho' ripe with rage to burst,</br>Much to complain, inclin'd, if to complain they durst.", "O heav'nly guardian of th' attemper'd breast,</br>Against th' oppressor's insolence and pow'r,</br>Against the scorner's sneer, the fool's dull jest,</br>And 'gainst each falshood new born with the hour,</br>Patience!  to thee these lowly lays I bring,</br>Craving thy aid to those who hear me sing.</br>"]
