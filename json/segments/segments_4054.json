["Alas!  he's gone, by Death's dire stroke he's slain,</br>Dear to Apollo, and the Muses' train.</br>Who, Tit'rus, now poetic comments yields</br>On thee descanting in paternal fields?</br>Who now o'er Gallus' love in pity mourns,</br>But from whose pains Lycoris scornful turns?</br>No budding trees in beauteous order rear'd,</br>Nor lowing herds, nor bleating flocks are heard;</br>No well-till'd fields their wonted pleasure give,</br>Nor grateful murmurs of the busy hive.</br>Who now to Britain's Orpheus' mournful plaints</br>For his lost wife in Maro's numbers paints?</br>Echo his plaints, resounded far and near,</br>To the inhabitants of earth and air.</br>The Indian scorn'd his arrows, and his crown</br>Requiting thus parental favours shown.</br>Tearing her hair and breasts, wild Fancy stands;</br>Down drops her harp, beneath her trembling hands,</br>'Till, \"thy son lives,\" the whisp'ring Zephyr tells,</br>In those bless'd mansions where thy brother dwells;</br>Sitting in meads, where various flow'rs combine</br>To hear the poets chant their songs divine;</br>Dryden's grand ode, and Gray's triumphant car,</br>And Spenser's sighs, how pleasingly severe;</br>With Milton's wond'rous voice, and Homer's fire,</br>And daring flights of Pindar's doric lyre.</br>"]
