["At the door of my straw cover'd cot,</br>The rose and the jessamine blend;</br>Each tree that o'ershadows the spot</br>Is dear to my heart as a friend.</br>Its course from the first noble donor</br>From father to son, can we trace,</br>For ages the seat of fair honour,</br>Content, independence, and peace.", "The lark, to enliven our toil,</br>High-mounting in extasy sings;</br>No med'cine our appetites spoil,</br>Health ever from industry springs.</br>Kind fortune permits to extend,</br>Tho' she give not a superfluous store,</br>A jug and a crust to a friend,</br>A morsel to gladden the poor.", "The trav'ller at fast falling night</br>The smoke of my cottage surveys,</br>And journeys with bosom more light,</br>Secure of refreshment and ease.</br>In support and defence of the land</br>That yields such enjoyment to me,</br>Undaunted by menace I stand,</br>To preserve uncorrupted and free.</br>"]
