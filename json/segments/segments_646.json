["Like some faire Deer by Hunters close pursued,</br>Who bath'd in sweet explores the cooling Flood;</br>So my poore Soul, by eager Foes subdued,</br>Looks up to thee, the ever-living GOD!</br>When, when shall I approach that happie Place</br>Where shines thy Glory, and where rests thy Peace?", "I pass my Days in Sighs, in Grones, and Tears,</br>While my sad Breast incessant Railings load,</br>\"Who now his Cries, or his Petition hears,</br>Where is, they scornful cry, his boasted GOD?\"</br>My Heart oppress'd, with Anguish and Despaire,</br>Looks up to thee, sole Auditor of Prayer!", "Oh!  let thy heavenly Beams these Sorrowes cheere,</br>Dispell these Clouds of life-consuming Care!</br>Vouchsafe the Voice of my Distress to heare,</br>Regard my Sufferings, and attend my Prayer!</br>While my proud Foes insult me from afar,</br>Be thou my Refuge from the hostile War!", "And see! &mdash; my Soul, his glorious Arm display'd!</br>My Rock of Hope, my high Defence is near;</br>At length he grants his favourable Aid,</br>Behold my great Deliverer appear!</br>Smile then my Soul!  nor droop within my Breast,</br>Trust still in GOD, and he shall give thee Rest!</br>"]
