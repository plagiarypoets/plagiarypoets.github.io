["Relentless Time, for ever on the wing,</br>That, like th' insidious Parthian, in thy flight,</br>Dost at the bleeding hearts of mortals fling</br>Dart after dart, too sure, alas!  to smite;</br>Oh!  swift as winds amidst their swiftest course,</br>Swift as the shaft that's hurl'd with more than mortal force!", "Too well thy frauds I know &mdash; too deeply feel</br>Those pangs which soon or late are felt by all.</br>But, why of Time complain? &mdash; My heart, be still;</br>On me, me only, the reproach should fall.</br>Nature cloath'd Time with wings, nor cloath'd in vain:</br>Shall he, fond man, for thee his rapid course restrain?", "To thee, too nature prov'd supremely kind;</br>She plac'd thy feet in reason's sacred way,</br>And chear'd the dark recesses of thy mind</br>With intellectual light, whose friendly ray</br>Might teach thee what to fly from, what to love,</br>Point to pure bliss below, and purer joys above.", "But ah!  this kindness how have I misus'd!</br>I scorn'd the aid of this celestial light;</br>That flowery path I ought to have refus'd,</br>I blindly chose; and straight eternal night</br>O'ercast that dawn of bliss, but late so fair,</br>Black phantoms rising now, shame, anguish, and despair!", "What then for me remains? &mdash; Attend, be wise;</br>Turn, turn thy view, too long to earth deprest,</br>To those bright realms beyond thy kindred skies,</br>Where smiles the mourner, and the weary rest!</br>Steer thy frail bark for that auspicious shore,</br>Where never winds assail, nor furious tempests roar.", "O Laura, Laura!  round my aching heart,</br>How does thy dear, thy charming image twine!</br>How shall my soul from its lov'd idol part?</br>Ah!  how its heavenly treasure e'er resign?</br>Fain would I from my endless cares be free;</br>Fain would I bid adieu to all but love and thee!</br>"]
