["L'ALLEGRO.</br>Love shall not disturb our rest,</br>Social joys of life are best!</br>We're for frolic, sport, and play,</br>Come, and laugh your hours away!", "IL PENSOROSO.</br>Let us trace the lonely vale,</br>Hear the love-lorn nightingale:</br>Love invite to secret glades,</br>Purling streams, and moonlight shades.", "L'ALLEGRO.</br>We enjoy our crouded plains,</br>Cheerful nymphs, and careless swains,</br>Join with us the busy throng,</br>We're for merry dance and song!", "IL PENSOROSO.</br>Love's fond passion sooths the mind,</br>We're to tender love inclin'd:</br>Sweets its languours, calm its joys,</br>Friend to peace, and foe to noise.", "CHORUS.</br>When pleasure's inviting, obey the glad call,</br>Let all have delight, for there's joy for us all:</br>Here's mirth for the jovial, who never repine,</br>For Love here's the myrtle, for Wit, the rich vine!</br>"]
