["Pale, haggard Suicide!  thou fell disease!</br>Thou maniac passion of Misfortune's child!</br>When ev'ry scene of life has fail'd to please,</br>And, 'stead of comfort, planted phrenzy wild!</br>Possess'd by thee the mind of Hope devoid,</br>With eager rapture clings to fell Despair:</br>Who, dreadful thought!  presents the glassy tide</br>Or some vile engine to destroy each care.</br>Thus far estrang'd from Virtue's flow'ry way,</br>Contending passions urge the fatal stroke;</br>Then fell despair, with her tyrannic sway,</br>Completes a deed thou never canst revoke!</br>Presumptuous Man!  why unprepar'd thus go,</br>To meet thy GOD, and fly thy mortal Foe?</br>"]
