["I.</br>Close in this deep Retreat</br>O coolly let me sit,</br>Shelter'd from the sultry Day!</br>Sirius and Sol with burning Beams</br>So strike the gasping Fields below,</br>That not an Ox is heard to low,</br>Or little Warbler from his Throat</br>To pour the sweetly-winding Note.", "II.</br>The Nymphs that keep this circling Wood,</br>And beauteous Naiads of the neighb'ring Flood,</br>With their Dew-dropping Hair,</br>Oft to this unadorned Cave repair,</br>To dance and trip it in a Round</br>On the smooth and hallow'd Ground;</br>And say &mdash; \"That Diana's Grott, and Thetis' Bow'rs,</br>Must yield in Coolness and in Shade to our's.\"&mdash;", "III.</br>'Twas Here, as old Traditions tell,</br>A wither'd Witch was wont to dwell;</br>The magic Mutterings of whose Voice could call</br>A thousand Daemons from their darksome Hall,</br>Bid haste the wild Winds from their Northern Caves,</br>Obscure the Moon, and rouse the roaring Waves:</br>Here LUD, retiring from fierce Battle came,</br>And from his Helmet quaff'd the cooling Stream;</br>Leant on his Spear, unreign'd his foamy Steed,</br>To pasture on the green, refreshful Mead.", "IV.</br>Here what a solemn Silence reigns,</br>Save the Tinklings of a Rill,</br>That gushing from the hollow Hill,</br>Pensive, as it runs, complains.</br>But hark!  methinks a Spirit speaks,</br>A Voice from the remotest Caverns breaks;&mdash;</br>\"From the vain World learn, Mortal, to retire,</br>With true Ambition to high Heav'n aspire;</br>Grandeur and Glory trifling Hearts trepan,</br>These Toys disdain, for Virtue makes the Man.\"&mdash;", "V.</br>Let me therefore ever dwell,</br>In this twilight, solemn Cell,</br>For musing Melancholy made,</br>Whose entrance venerable Oaks o'ershade,</br>And whose Roof that lowly bends,</br>With awful Gloom my serious Thoughts befriends:</br>Here let me dwell,</br>'Till Death shall say &mdash; \"Thy Cavern leave,</br>Change it for a darker Grave.\"</br>"]
