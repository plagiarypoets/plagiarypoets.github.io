["Hail!  Virgin of aetherial birth,</br>Thou more lovely far than Mirth,</br>O hither bend thy way!</br>Come, beauteous Nymph, serenely smiling,</br>Ev'ry anxious thought beguiling,</br>Thou mak'st each prospect gay.", "Thine eye with joy young Spring beholds,</br>When Nature ev'ry charm unfolds,</br>And spreads thy fav'rite hue;</br>When Eurus to his cave retires,</br>And Zephyr fans those glowing fires</br>That verdant life renew.", "Thou lov'st to range the fields at dawn,</br>Or meet the shepherds on the lawn,</br>At leisure Eve's advance;</br>Brisk Sport comes tripping o'er the mead,</br>And sweetly sounds his oaten reed,</br>And joins the rural dance.", "Not e'en hoar Winter's dreary sway,</br>Nor freezing blast can thee dismay,</br>Nor change thy sprightly mien;</br>'Tis then thou seek'st the social band,</br>And o'er their minds with gentle hand,</br>Diffus't a joy serene.", "Though absent Sol his ray denies,</br>Round the bright flame which Art supplies,</br>The friendly train regale;</br>Some fairy legend each imparts,</br>Whilst rapt Attention, gazing, starts</br>At ev'ry wond'rous tale.", "Thy presence charms stern grief to rest,</br>Thy light illumes th' untainted breast,</br>Sweet sister of Content;</br>Like her thou fly'st th' abandon'd mind,</br>Where Guilt, Despair, and Shame combin'd,</br>Their hapless prey torment.", "What magic in thy aspect dwells!</br>That Melancholy mist dispells;</br>What graces round thee shine!</br>Sweet Pleasure ever near thee stands,</br>With Transport, whose high soul expands,</br>And soars to realms divine.</br>"]
