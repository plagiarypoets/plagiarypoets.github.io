["When first thy beauty beam'd upon my soul,</br>Like morning darting on the misty deep,</br>Indifference, like a cloud, broke up, and stole</br>Away; and passions numberless from sleep</br>Awakening, o'er the trembling heart-strings sweep</br>Their fiery fingers, and my peace consume,</br>As some wild wassailers their revels keep,</br>While dumb Night nods without his sable plume,</br>Or whispers with pale Death, who piles their early tomb.", "Little, ah!  little did I then surmise,</br>While all my heart had dreamt of loveliness</br>Played on thy cheek, that those enchanting eyes</br>Could shine undimm'd upon my soul's distress,</br>Because, perchance, my heaps of coin were less</br>Than others boasted who thy heart assail'd</br>And gain'd, despite the well-feign'd tenderness,</br>The ready syren tears, that never fail'd</br>To moisten our press'd cheeks when I at fortune rail'd.", "But go thy way into the merry world,</br>And shine thy hour upon the painted scene,</br>Whence sorrow seems to nether darkness hurl'd,</br>While joy smiles in each face where she had been:</br>Yet aye remember that the laughing Queen</br>Of Love ne'er visits the brown vale of years,</br>Nor e'er has been to herd with wrinkles seen;</br>But, as the frosty head of age appears,</br>Turns back, and leaves life's thread to Grief's or Clotho's shears.", "And when thou stand'st deserted in thy age,</br>On the last sands of ebbing life alone,</br>Try then thy fierce repentance to assuage,</br>By recollecting that the only one</br>Who lov'd thee for thyself, perchance, is gone</br>To join the cohorts of the grave for thee;</br>Or, if he live, fly to him, he will moan</br>Thy fate, when all have fled thee, and will be</br>Thy guide to that sad realm where all sleep silently.</br>"]
