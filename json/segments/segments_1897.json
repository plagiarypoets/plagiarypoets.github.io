["O CHANTREY!  thou hast stolen the feeling all</br>Of Nature's young and innocent worshipers,</br>Of those whose hearts keep holy festival</br>Through the fair seasons of their beauteous years;</br>Whose feet go printless over woe; whose tears</br>But gem the looks of gladness where they light;</br>Whose lips are wet with honey; while the fears,</br>Waylaying mortal joys, may never fright</br>The soul from its repast, pure, sensitive, and light.", "For when the blight of ugly Death had thrown</br>Its lustre from that seat of love, the eye,</br>Then camest thou, and in thy chisell'd stone</br>Hewedest out these an immortality.</br>While their free spirits sought to glorify</br>The holiness of innocence with wings,</br>Thou had'st their fairy forms entraced lie,</br>As if they dreamt of Heaven, and lovely things</br>That Future still to Youth in radiant beauty brings.", "O artist!  pity thou couldst not bestow</br>The breath into those lips that gently part;</br>And give the warm blood in those veins to flow,</br>That seem to converse with the throbbing heart;</br>And bid that perfect foot with ardent start,</br>Climb the bright Helicon of Life's domain;&mdash;</br>Pity!  yet hardly so; &mdash; man has no art</br>To wake the youthful melody again;</br>And joy is oft, at best, the holiday of pain.", "Sweet forms!  sweet memories of what have been!</br>Fair triumphs of a noble art!  ye lie</br>Mocking at things of flesh, in all your green,</br>And everlasting freshness.  Oh!  gone by</br>I have known forms like yours, &mdash; yet they could die!</br>But your sweet sympathies shall perish not;</br>And ye, like rainbows promise-bent on high,</br>Shall point the mourner from his earthly spot,</br>To where immortal youth is joy's perculiar lot.</br>"]
