["Fix'd is the Date of all Things here below,</br>Relentless Time devours them soon or late:</br>Ev'n Springs shall fail, and Rivers cease to flow,</br>And mould'ring Mountains sink with Age's Weight.", "In vain that fierce Destroyer to defeat,</br>Proud Monuments of labour'd Art we raise,</br>Soon they decay and perish at his Feet,</br>Born down th' impetuous Stream of rolling Days.", "Alas!  must Beauty too be doom'd to fade?</br>Time is a Tyrant, whom no Charms can move:</br>Not even thine, LUCINDA, dearest Maid;</br>Even thine protected, by the God of Love.", "Smile on me, fair One, and my Pains asswage!</br>Thy Charms thro' unborn Ages I'll prolong;</br>I'll bid them scorn even Time's devouring Rage,</br>And Bloom for ever in immortal Song.", "Serenely smooth the easy Lines shall flow,</br>Brightly shall shine adorn'd with ev'ry Grace;</br>But to thy Smiles their Strength and Softness owe,</br>And steal their Beauties from thy Mind and Face.</br>"]
