["Ye Nymphs, that from Diana's Sport retir'd,</br>Yon Forest leave awhile, and love to haunt</br>The bord'ring Vallies; saw ye, as they pass'd,</br>A chosen Pair, the Glory of your Plains,</br>Array'd in Youth's full Bloom, and Nature's Prime?</br>Saw ye the Glance of Beauty, when the Fair,</br>Quiver'd with Charms, and by the Graces dress'd,</br>March'd on:  with Joy the Bridegroom flush'd, beyond</br>What liveliest Fancy, unpossess'd, can dream?", "Heard ye the Musick of the Groves around</br>Warbling, while Choirs of Gratulation rung</br>From ev'ry Spray; and Nightingales, soft tun'd,</br>In Notes peculiar trill'd, the Nuptial Song!</br>Such as in Neighb'ring Windsor's fav'rite Shade</br>They chaunt; and, if their Handel's Ear be true,</br>No where on Silence steal with Lay so sweet.", "Auspicious Omens brood on the fair Hour!</br>Did ever Hymen's Look more fresh appear,</br>Or his bright Vest with deeper Yellow flow?</br>The Vest that on Occasions high and rare</br>Pontifical he wears, when Hearts sincere</br>Combine; of healthy Cheek, and sparkling Eye</br>As in the State of Nature, ere his Shafts</br>By Gold were blunted.  How the blazing Torch,</br>Fann'd by Love's Pinion, sheds unusual Fire!</br>Lo!  by the Trail of Light, he left behind,</br>As from the Shrine his Jubilee return'd,</br>The Muse, invited Guest, attends her Theme</br>Right to the Nuptial Bow'r.  There ent'ring, thrice</br>She hemm'd, thrice blest the Threshold with a Sneeze,</br>Prelude of Happiness to come.  Her Lyre</br>She strung, &mdash; a friendly, voluntary Strain.", "\"Hail (she began) distinguish'd Pair!  how fit</br>To join in wedded Love, each other's Choice!</br>Bridegroom, thy Taste is elegant indeed,</br>And Fingers nice, that on some sunny Bank</br>In Beauty's Garden cull'd so fair a Flow'r,</br>To thine transplanted from her native Soil.</br>Cherish besure thy blooming Charge; keep off</br>Each Blast unkind, and Zephyr's Gale alone</br>Blow there, and genial Suns for ever smile.</br>Who not applaud thy Vow?  hereafter who</br>Dispute thy Palate, judging and exact,</br>Owner of curious Bliss? &mdash; Nor Thou, fair Bride,</br>Repine, nor homeward cast thy longing Eye;</br>'Twas time to sever from the Virgin Choir.</br>What Joy in Loneliness to waste the Hours</br>Unfruitful?  see, hard by, Loddona's Stream</br>Cold and inactive creep along; her Face</br>Shaded with pensive Willow, &mdash; till anon</br>Married to jovial Thames, briskly she glides</br>O'er many a laughing Mead.&mdash; 'Tis Nature wills</br>Such Union:  blest Society!  where Souls</br>Move, as in Dance, to Melody divine</br>Fit Partners.  (How unlike the noisy Broils</br>Of wedded Strife!)  Hence Friendship's gen'rous Glow</br>At Love's high Noon; and hence the sober Flame</br>Steady, as Life declines. &mdash; All Comforts hence</br>Of Child and Parent, strongest, dearest Ties!</br>Think not the fair Original design'd</br>To flourish and be lost.  The World expects</br>Some Copies to adorn another Age.&mdash;</br>Thank the kind Gods;  Be happy, live and love.</br>"]
