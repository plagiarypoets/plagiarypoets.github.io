["Obscure, low in a humble cottage lived</br>A father, mother, and a gen'rous friend,</br>Who, all their pious children had survived,</br>Nor yet had come to life's uncertain end:</br>Within their cot, kind nature seemed to blend</br>Fair virtue, innocence, and sweet content,</br>Nor suffered one vile, base, dissembling fiend,</br>Disturb that humble unassuming tent;</br>But wrapt in love divine their souls were heavenward bent.", "From worldly care, from sorrow, pain and strife,</br>Long had they lived in this sequestered scene,</br>Devoid of all that plagues and poisons life,</br>'Till age, old age, had crept along serene,</br>And found them there far happier I ween,</br>Thus lowly in retirements fond embrace,</br>Than palaced kings in youthful hours have been,</br>In open show, with all their pomp and grace,</br>And every wily art that counterfeits the face.", "No art had they, no mild and radiant smile</br>Played on their cheek, nor dropt the chrystal tear,</br>Save when their thoughts were bent of God the while,</br>Save when their hearts o'erflowed with love sincere!</br>Save when their souls in fond affection dear,</br>Gazed on the heavens with a wishful eye!</br>But willing to remain or to appear,</br>As it should please their gracious God on high,</br>Who watched around their cot with a paternal eye.", "Oh!  gracious heaven!  such as these reward,</br>And fondly eye them with peculiar care;</br>O be their friend, their guardian, and guard,</br>When cruel death shall chance to wonder there!</br>And oh!  attend to their last fervent pray'r</br>When they shall leave the scene they long have viewed,</br>Uphold their age amid death's livid glare,</br>And when their tongues no more lisp \"Great God!\"</br>Their rising souls shall speak in tears of gratitude!</br>"]
