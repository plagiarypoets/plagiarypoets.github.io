["ROSELINDA.</br>Beneath a shady Wood at Break of Day</br>All on the Ground sad Roselinda lay;</br>A little Hillock turfted o'er with Grass</br>Form'd a soft Pillow for the pensive Lass.</br>Thus Roselinda lay, while round her smile</br>The red edg'd Daisie and green Camomile.</br>The pining Daisie hung its envious Head,</br>Languid its Whiteness grew, and pale its Red;</br>No more it spreads its Colours to the Sun,</br>Those Beauties were by Roselind outdone.</br>When thus the Maiden vents her rueful Tale,</br>And Tears with fluent Eloquence prevail.</br>The Winds are conscious to her Plaints alone,</br>And in soft Murmurs answer ev'ry Groan.</br>Ah!  Colinet, she cry'd, how long must I</br>Wish for my Death, yet be deny'd to die?</br>Thy Roselinda now nought else can crave,</br>Since she has follow'd mourning to the Grave.</br>I well remember my Concern for you,</br>When round your Cot the jetty Raven flew,</br>And three times croak'd; but when it ceas'd its Flight,</br>And on your new made Thatch I saw it light,</br>Oh!  none can tell how grievous was my Fright!</br>Down on my Knees I fell, and beg'd of Pan,</br>To pity Roselind, and spare her Swain;</br>But beg'd in vain; for on that very Night</br>I by your Window spied this dismal Sight:</br>The Dogs beneath had routed up the Ground,</br>Which tho' I thrice fill'd up, thrice open found,</br>And more to fill the Measure of my Woe,</br>They give three ominous Howls before they go.</br>I, all in Tears, cry'd, Colinet is gone,</br>And I poor hapless Maiden am undone!</br>That Haw-thorn Hedge, that wont so blithe t' appear,</br>And trim with Flowers when Colinet was here,</br>No more shall seem or blithe or gay again,</br>Since cruel Death my Colinet has ta'en.</br>The gold-bill'd Blackbird, and the dapple Thrush,</br>That wont to caroll sweet on ev'ry Bush,</br>No longer Pleasaunce give; my Shepherd's Art</br>Form'd the melodious Sounds that fir'd the Heart.", "When first I went a Field to milk my Cow,</br>I saw him stand by Gaffer Hobson's Mow,</br>And whilst he careless lean'd upon his Rake,</br>My rising Bosom panted for his Sake;</br>Straight I hy'd Home, 'twas Eve of good Saint Mark,</br>Then I resolv'd to know my loving Spark.</br>My Dame, not weening what was in my Head,</br>Eat some Milk-Porridge, and went to Bed.</br>My House I swept, a bonny Fire I made,</br>Set out the Table, and the Cloth I laid,</br>Then brought the Victuals from the Shelf within,</br>And hung a clean wash't Smock a-cross a Line;</br>Then who wou'd come to turn it watch'd to see,</br>For he they say shall your true Lover be.</br>Beneath the Table I sat down unseen,</br>And e'er 'twas long young Colinet came in,</br>As near as I can guess 'twas one a Clock,</br>When pleas'd I saw the Shepherd turn my Smock.</br>But ah the piteous Sight for Roselind!</br>A Satyr bore a Coffin close behind.</br>At this, surpriz'd, to Bed with speed I creep,</br>Nor got that livelong Night one Wink of Sleep.</br>A thousand Whimsies still possess'd my Head,</br>But most I fear'd that Colinet was dead.</br>Next Morning raithe I rose before the Sun,</br>And in my Shift to my Casement run,</br>When overjoy'd I spy'd my Colinet</br>Pass whistling gay by Cuddy's Meadow Gate.", "Unwittingly at Night I went to Bed,</br>And slept with Prayer Book beneath my Head:</br>The waggish Prittilis had laid it there,</br>And plac'd it open in a Leaf most rare,</br>The Place whereby the Parson does the Work,</br>When Lads and Lasses join their Hands at Kirk.</br>She put a Sixpence too, and cross'd a Pair</br>Of Box-haft Knives, which she had brought last Fair.</br>She had been told, it seems, that this wou'd prove</br>A Charm to make one dream of one's true Love.</br>As thus I lay, the Visions of the Night</br>O'er-joy'd my Bosom with too vast Delight.</br>Methought I saw a blithesome Lad come forth,</br>Dight with the Beauties of the plunder'd Earth.</br>The Cowslip, Daisie, Rose and Jessamine</br>In blended Wreaths about his Temples twine.</br>Straight from his Head he doff'd the Garland now,</br>And plac'd the flow'ry Trophies on my Brow.</br>Just here the envious Cock my Slumbers broke,</br>By crowing thrice, till from my Dream I woke.</br>So up I got as soon as I cou'd see,</br>And sped across the Mead to milk my Kee.</br>Then home with smoaking Kit eftsoons I came,</br>Churn'd last Night's Cream, and then call'd up my Dame.</br>I fed my Poultry, and well serv'd the Swine,</br>And carry'd Hay to keep in Heart my Kine.</br>Then Prittilis and I a Bargain make,</br>To gang i' th' Afternoon to Bush-Green Wake.</br>Where when we came, a jovial Crew we found</br>Of Lads and Lasses seated on the Ground.</br>Two oaken Towels in the Midst were laid,</br>And two new Belts of toughest Leather made.</br>High in the Air there hung a flow'ry Crown,</br>To grace his Brows that had the Conquest won.</br>Beside the Garland wav'd a Riband too,</br>The clearest Sky ne'er show'd a fairer Blue.</br>Then Clouterkin came forth, a Belt he took,</br>And challeng'd all the Swains with haughty Look.</br>Young Colinet stept up towards the Clown,</br>Took t' other Belt, and laid the Bumkin down.</br>The angry Swain resolv'd to've t' other Bout;</br>But Colinet soon threw the clumsy Lout.</br>The Lad disgrac'd, amid the Crowd retir'd,</br>When Colinet, with Thirst of Glory fir'd,</br>Snatch'd up the oaken Weapon from the Ground,</br>And wav'd it thrice with deftest Motion round.</br>Then Clouterkin advanc'd with mighty Rage,</br>Resolv'd once more the Victor to engage.</br>The other Cudgel from the Earth he took,</br>Their Lengths once measur'd, no Delay they brook.</br>Long Time the Fray was doubtful of its End;</br>For both with Art oppose, with Art defend.</br>As on the Grass the rosie Lasses sate,</br>Their Breasts oft anxious heav'd for Colinet.</br>The peerless Lad at length grew wondrous quaint,</br>And towards the Lubbar's Heels he made a Feint:</br>The Lout there guards, unmindful of his Fate,</br>So Colinet struck home, and broke his Pate.</br>A sympathizing Laugh spreads o'er the Plains,</br>Poor Clouterkin was jear'd by all the Swains.</br>A threefold Conquest Colinet might boast;</br>For Damsels strove who should applaud him most.</br>Straight with the Riband blue the Victor's bound,</br>And the gay Garland girt his Temples round.</br>With Eyes intent the jealous Lasses view,</br>What happy Maid the Conqu'ror shou'd subdue.</br>Smiling across the Ring the Shepherd sped,</br>And plac'd the Sylvan Wreath around my Head.</br>The Riband too he gave me, and with this,</br>A long expected and long wisht-for Kiss.</br>Bedight with these, I all that Day was seen</br>Mixt with the Lads and Lasses on the Green</br>In various Dance as fine as any Queen;</br>Till sable Clouds, deckt round with Golden Light,</br>Forewarn'd the Shepherds of approaching Night.</br>At setting Sun the rural Pastimes end,</br>The rustick Rout dispers'd, all homeward tend;</br>Twixt the green Quicksets Colinet and I,</br>Pleasing and pleas'd, toward my Cottage hie.</br>Sometimes he press'd my Hand, and sighing said,</br>Oh!  were it always thus, my charming Maid!</br>Sometimes to make the Journey seem less long,</br>He'd pass the idle Moments in a Song,</br>Or with his Pipe he'd fill the neighbouring Grounds,</br>Till pining Echoes wanton'd with the Sounds</br>By various Repetition; whilst the Swain</br>Play'd careless on thro' ev'ry puzzling Strain.</br>How pleasant has it been to see the Fawns,</br>Fleet as the Winds, feud o'er the russet Lawns?</br>Or set with Colinet, and see the Lambs</br>In harmless Sports frisk round their fleecy Dams?</br>We surely were the blithest Lass and Swain,</br>That ever tended Sheep upon the Plain.</br>But now, alas!  all Sun-burnt is my Neck,</br>The Cherry glows not on my faded Cheek.</br>So pale my Face is grown, I scarce can tell</br>I saw my own sad Form in yonder Well.</br>Oh!  never may my Visage bloom again,</br>Till I in Death shall join my peerless Swain!</br>Ah Colinet!  thou Lad of mickle Meed,</br>That well couldst sing, and dance, and tune the Reed!</br>Why do I think on what he was?  he's dead,</br>And Roselinda's ev'ry Joy is fled.", "Thus sung the Maid her Melancholy Tale,</br>In Musick mournful as the Nightingale,</br>When dusky Clouds across the Welkin flew,</br>And spread a sable Mantle o'er its Blue.</br>The gaudy heavenly Bow so rear explains</br>A Tempest rising, and descending Rains.</br>The piteous Damsel leaves her grassy Bed,</br>And thro' a neigh'bring Meadow homeward sped.</br>With swelling Teats her lowing Cattle stand,</br>And wait the gentle Pressure of her Hand.</br>"]
