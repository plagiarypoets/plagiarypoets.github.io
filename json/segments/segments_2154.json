["Swift o'er the hemisphere, celestial Morn</br>Pours fairest light, to beautify the Spring;</br>Pure dews the fresh delightful fields adorn</br>With trembling lustre, fann'd by zephyr's wing;</br>The sloping hills and sunny vales appear</br>In May's delightful hues, the beauty of the year.", "O!  what a burst of music fills the grove,</br>When birds, awaking, hail the infant day;</br>Sweet nightingales, with melting sounds of love,</br>And linnets, larks, and thrushes join the lay,</br>Some on the wing in airy circles fly,</br>'Light on the hedge in pairs, or soar into the sky.", "In full perfection shines the gay parterre,</br>Where yonder noble mansion tow'rs sublime;</br>Refreshing odours fill the morning air,</br>Where blending sweets rise from the flow'ry prime;</br>The rose, all balmy spirit, chears the sight,</br>Carnation's gorgeous bloom, and lillies spotless white.", "Adjoining, see the shrubbery adorn</br>The pleasure-ground, with various shades of green;</br>And roseate blossoms, fair as smiling morn,</br>Where she ascends the vernal skies serene;</br>And see the tender nursery of trees,</br>With springing verdure crown'd, light waving in the breeze.", "Come, Fancy!  let us range the living mead,</br>And pluck the pendent cowslip from its stem;</br>Or to the river's brink thy vot'ry lead,</br>To gaze, delighted, in the passing stream;</br>There live the finny tribes, that, glitt'ring, play</br>In the pure element, enjoying chearful day.", "Thus would I live, with Innocence and Peace,</br>Nor e'er unconscious view the varying year;</br>But, with the gifts of Time, my joy encrease,</br>And bless the gracious Pow'r who plac'd me here.</br>O!  whilst I God's amazing works admire,</br>May Piety unfeign'd my bright'ning soul inspire.</br>"]
