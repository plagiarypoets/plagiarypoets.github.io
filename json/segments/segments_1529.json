["First-born of night, that o'er the western heaven</br>Slow mov'st in radiant silence to thy rest!</br>What sad emotion, 'mid the smiling even,</br>Thy bright-beam'd circlet pours upon my breast!</br>'Tis not &mdash; fair star! &mdash; that shedding aught of woe,</br>Thy ray can touch the spring of mortal tear,</br>But that, in happier days, past long ago,</br>When yon dark hill receiv'd thy bright career,</br>True to the promis'd hour, my Ellen met me here!", "Ye spires, where soothing tolls the vesper bell,</br>To wearied hamlets welcome sound of peace,</br>To me your tones seem Hope's departing knell,</br>Vibrating slowly on the sullen breeze!</br>Yes &mdash; peace to quiet minds the murmurs yeild&mdash;</br>To mine, no more!  For near this shadowy grove,</br>When silent ev'ning heard yon signal peal'd,</br>Light o'er the lonely glade, she dar'd to move,</br>And Ellen's lips met mine, the first warm kiss of love!", "Speed not, fair star!  to thine accustom'd hill!</br>Your varying melody, ye spires, give o'er!</br>Those rays no more mine eyes with rapture fill&mdash;</br>Those tones can bid my heart to throb no more!</br>For to a distant land, condemn'd to mourn</br>A parent's ruin'd fortune, Ellen flies!&mdash;</br>She fled, alas! &mdash; but never to return!&mdash;</br>And other peals are  heard, and stars arise,</br>O'er the unnoticed grave, where gentle Ellen lies!</br>"]
