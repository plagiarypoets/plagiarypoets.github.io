["O thou, that to the moon-light vale</br>Warblest oft thy plaintive tale,</br>What time the village-murmurs cease,</br>And the still eye is hush'd to peace,</br>When now no busy sound is heard,</br>CONTEMPLATION's favourite bird!", "Chauntress of night, whose amorous song</br>First heard the tufted groves among,</br>Warns wanton MABBA to begin</br>Her revels on the circled green,</br>Whene'er by MEDITATION led</br>I nightly seek some distant mead,", "A short repose of cares to find,</br>And sooth my love-distracted mind,</br>O fail not then, sweet PHILOMEL,</br>Thy sadly-warbled woes to tell;</br>In sympathetic numbers join</br>Thy pangs of luckless love with mine!", "So may no swain's rude hand infest</br>Thy tender young, and rob thy nest;</br>Nor ruthless fowler's guileful snare</br>Lure thee to leave the fields of air,</br>No more to visit vale or shade,</br>Some barbarous virgin's captive made.</br>"]
