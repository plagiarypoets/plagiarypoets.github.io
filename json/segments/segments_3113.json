["When Great Eliza, to Britannia's Throne</br>From a base Prison rais'd, Illustrious shone:</br>Reform'd Religion, like returning Morn,</br>With dawning Beams did Albion's Isle adorn;</br>And chasing Rome's Infernal Shades away,</br>Diffus'd a radiant Promise of the Day.</br>With pure Religion from her Youth embu'd,</br>The Pious Queen Coelestial Truth pursu'd.</br>With a sincere Devotion she ador'd</br>The Christian Founder, and obey'd his Word;</br>But impious Rome's Idolatry abhor'd.</br>Since watchful Heav'n so oft did interpose,</br>To guard her from the Rage of Papal Foes;</br>Had oft inclin'd, with providential Care,</br>A cruel Court, her precious Life to spare;</br>And had at last, the Tempest over-blown,</br>In Peace advanc'd her to th' Imperial Throne;</br>Mov'd by Coelestial Piety, she thought</br>She should Divine Religion's Cause promote.</br>Should that reform'd and purer Church restore,</br>Which her bless'd Brother did assert before;</br>And which to persecute with Sword and Fire,</br>Fierce Roman Zeal Maria did inspire.</br>To pure Belief Britannia to convert,</br>Was the Concern, which nearly touch'd her Heart.</br>This was the Heav'nly End she had in view,</br>Which she with Care and Conduct did pursue.</br>To the bless'd Task unwearied did attend;</br>For Princes only can their People mend.", "Some Lords, who felt the Anguish and the Pain</br>Of Wounds inflicted in the former Reign;</br>Did now with hot, revengeful Passion burn,</br>To make the Oppressors suffer in their turn:</br>These injur'd Men, thus Human Nature's made,</br>To use her Pow'r, the Pious Queen perswade:</br>Without Distinction, Pity, or Respect,</br>To treat the cruel, persecuting Sect:</br>They urge, the Tyrants, who had never shown</br>Bowels of Mercy, could have Right to none.</br>That those should now their just Reward receive,</br>Who did Britannia of her Sons bereave,</br>And of Infernal Hate, the horrid Tokens leave.</br>Who in their Neighbours Ruin did engage,</br>With Salvage Fierceness, and relentless Rage.</br>Fam'd Roman Saints, who with Religious Spoil,</br>And Meritorious Murders, fill'd the Isle:</br>Who tortur'd, burnt, massacr'd, ruin'd all</br>That would not Rome, the World's great Empress call,</br>And to her Wafer-God in low Prostration fall.", "They did the Danger to the Queen display,</br>That would attend a mild and gentle Way:</br>If those around her Person she employ'd,</br>Who hate her Worship, and her Friends destroy'd,</br>She would her Friends dismay, revive her Foes,</br>And tempt them to disturb her Realm's Repose.</br>That faithless Zealots of the Roman Breed,</br>To Crowns reform'd, were Traytors by their Creed.</br>That their Religion plunges them in Blood,</br>And makes them call the blackest Actions good.</br>That while she gave them Posts of Pow'r and Trust,</br>She deadly Vipers in her Bosom nurst.</br>That thus her Sacred Life she did expose</br>To the known Mercy of her cruel Foes.</br>That all should lose their Heads, who had embu'd</br>Their impious Hands in Sacred Martyrs Blood.</br>That Albion's Queen should act an open Part,</br>Should Rome's renounce, and her own Faith assert.</br>That all the Roman Shrines should be destroy'd,</br>And fierce Maria's Laws be render'd void.", "But the Great Cecil, a discerning Head,</br>In Glorious Edward's Court, and Councils bred,</br>More mod'rate Maxims to Eliza gave,</br>Which might Religion and her Empire save.</br>He thought rough Methods would the State embroil,</br>And with seditious Uproar fill the Isle.</br>That if the Pious Monarch should at once</br>Pure Christian Faith Profess, and Rome's renounce;</br>Should she at once Church-grievances redress,</br>And Anti-christian Romanists suppress,</br>Their Temples raze, their Altars overturn,</br>And with Contempt their Sacred Reliques spurn:</br>This soon the Roman Bigots would alarm,</br>Exasperate their Priests, and make their Vot'ries Arm;</br>Who lately cheer'd, and favour'd by the Crown,</br>Were num'rous, strong, and formidable grown,</br>And might in Arms prove dang'rous to the Throne.</br>That three great Pow'rs, Ausonia, France, and Spain,</br>Would Rome's Religion, and Decrees maintain.</br>That Britain's green, unsettled Government,</br>Her Factions growing, and her Treasure spent,</br>Could not collect sufficient Force to bear,</br>At once a Forreign, and Domestick War.</br>Therefore the Queen should with mild Means asswage</br>The great Disease, which sharper would enrage.</br>By soft and gentle Steps, should to the Cure</br>Slowly advance, and sooth the angry Sore,</br>'Till milder grown, and for the Lance mature.</br>Harsh Methods with the Zealots should forbear,</br>Manage their Doubts and Jealousies with Care,</br>And not incense, and drive them to Despair.</br>Should treat the greatest Leaders of the Sect,</br>Not with Caresses, nor with Disrespect,</br>The Mean between Endearment and Neglect.</br>Should in the Ship allow them some Command,</br>But never let them in the Steerage stand.</br>That on her Favour they may still depend,</br>Serve her as Queen, and love her as a Friend.</br>Safely, mean time, she might slow Changes make,</br>And by degrees their Church in pieces take.</br>'Till she had pull'd the Roman Fabrick down,</br>Their Altars ruin'd, and restor'd her own.</br>Thus Cecil, Bacon of Immortal Name,</br>Bedford, Northampton, all advis'd the same.", "Britannia's Queen, as Heav'nly Seraphs, Wise,</br>Gracious, and Good, was pleas'd with this Advice.</br>She by degrees did her great Ends promote,</br>For Moderation she a Vertue thought.</br>She knew, that rash Attempts, and Zeal too warm,</br>Would sooner ruin Albion, than reform.</br>She ne'er imagin'd, that to be Discreet,</br>From want of Courage came, or want of Wit.</br>None yet to her the Secret did reveal,</br>That those who keep a Temper, lose their Zeal,</br>That none but those who Wound, are fit to Heal.</br>The Queen believ'd the Steady, Wise, Sedate,</br>Were fittest Men for Counsellors of State.</br>That States-men of an over-heated Brain,</br>And Bigots of a persecuting Strain,</br>Do in Religion desp'rate Measures take,</br>And ruin Kingdoms for a Party's sake.</br>She therefore cooler Counsels did approve,</br>Did step by step in Reformation move.</br>As when Physicians by discreet Degrees,</br>Attack an old and obstinate Disease,</br>Good Med'cines so apply'd, the Sick restore,</br>Which rough Attempts may kill, can never cure.</br>So the Wise Queen by wary Methods strove</br>Britannia's great Distempers to remove,</br>When deeply rooted, and invet'rate grown,</br>They undermin'd the Church, or shook the Throne.", "Th' illustrious Confessors in Prisons thrown,</br>Who lay impatient of the Martyr's Crown,</br>Did the Pollutions of the Dungeon chuse,</br>Rather than thine, O Rome!  and Life refuse,</br>Rather than yield to thy bewitching Charms,</br>Or be defil'd in thy adult'rous Arms;</br>Were by the Queen, freed from their pond'rous Chains,</br>Their foul Apartments, and tormenting Pains.</br>They did with Praise the Queen's Indulgence own,</br>Who Freedom gave, which robb'd them of a Crown.", "The Gospel, which a Pris'ner was, no less</br>Than those, who did its Sacred Truth profess,</br>Was next enlarged, and suffer'd to display</br>Immortal Light, and Beatifick Day:</br>More than Aegyptian Darkness to dispel,</br>The complicated Shades of Rome and Hell.</br>Rome stop'd with Art, this Heav'nly Source of Light,</br>With Art conceal'd it from the People's Sight,</br>Which all her foul Impostures would detect,</br>And make Mankind with Scorn her Yoke reject.</br>She therefore did, her Empire to secure,</br>Confine the Foe, that would subvert her Pow'r.</br>But now the Sacred Volumes open laid,</br>O'er all the Isle convincing Light convey'd,</br>And soon to Truth unnumber'd Converts made.</br>The Usurpations of apostate Rome,</br>Her impious Frauds did naked now become.</br>Enlighten'd Albion from her Fetters broke,</br>And from her Neck cast off the Roman Yoke.</br>From Pagan Rights, and Superstition freed,</br>She purg'd her Tempels, and reform'd her Creed.</br>As when some vile, invidious Persons stop</br>A Crystal Brook, and dam the Current up,</br>The Fields around, defrauded of Supply,</br>Are chopt with Drought, and lose their verdant Dye:</br>If some just Neighbours, Friends to publick Good,</br>Remove th' obstructing Dam, and free the Flood,</br>The flowing Water o'er the Vally spreads,</br>And with a welcome Tide regales the thirsty Meads.</br>Each joyful Field caress'd by fruitful Streams,</br>With verdant Births, and gay Conception teams.</br>So when Eliza's Hand in Rome's Despight,</br>Drew up the Sluces of imprison'd Light,</br>Outgush'd a Torrent of Coelestial Day,</br>Which under Floods of Light, did all Britannia lay.</br>Christ's Vine-yard smil'd, and every Heav'nly Vine,</br>Bore noble Clusters, bless'd with gen'rous Wine.", "The Kingdom thus dispos'd, the Pious Queen</br>Did Britain's noble Lords and States convene.</br>With their Concurrence did by Law restore,</br>The pure Belief that Albion own'd before;</br>When her fam'd Brother Britain's Throne possess'd,</br>And with paternal Care his Kingdom bless'd.</br>The Garden Christ enclos'd when here below,</br>Thro' which he bad his living Waters flow,</br>Which Flowers from Heav'n transplanted did adorn,</br>And Golden Fruit on Trees Immortal born;</br>Was soon o'er-run, O ignominious Sloth!</br>By thy curss'd Henbane of luxuriant Growth.</br>O Rome!  who did'st pollute the Fountain's Head,</br>Which endless Life in Crystal Streams convey'd.</br>The Pious Queen did with successful Care</br>Th' infected Waters purge, and made their Current clear.</br>Of every baneful Tree, and noxious Weed</br>Of Rome's Plantation, she the Garden freed,</br>And sow'd the Sacred Ground with new Coelestial Seed.</br>A Seed which cheer'd with Heav'n's prolifick Streams,</br>And with the Sun of Righteousness his Beams,</br>A glorious Harvest brought in Hell's Despight,</br>Of Bliss eternal, and immortal Light.</br>Not Rome with all her Vigilance could stop</br>The swift Production of the Heav'nly Crop;</br>Britannia's present Joy, and future Hope.</br>Thus the Good Queen, like her bless'd Lord before,</br>To their first Use his Temples did restore.</br>O'er-turn'd their Seats, who there prophanely sold</br>Unhallow'd Ware, and barter'd Toys for Gold.</br>She scourg'd the greedy Money-changers home,</br>And broke the Market, and base Trade of Rome.", "Rome's haughty Head, the eldest Son of Pride,</br>Who with our Princes did their Pow'r
