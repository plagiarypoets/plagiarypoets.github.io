["Hail solemn Fancy, prompt my mournful Song,</br>And with thee bring self-torturing Grief along;</br>Rummage the Cavern of Despair,</br>Bid drooping Melancholy come,</br>To weep o'er hapless Chloe's Tomb.</br>Chloe, who never fail'd, with wanton Play,</br>(Well pleas'd, whene'er I stroak'd her beauteous Ears)</br>To court my Love; she on my Lap would lay,</br>Free from all Dangers, unalarm'd by Fears,</br>The sportive Partner of each happy Day.", "Where were ye Muses, when my Chloe dy'd,</br>How were ye then employ'd?</br>Ye were not near her Cushion plac'd,</br>Nor on the Grass-plat, where she wont to play.</br>Phoebus, thy Pow'r was ne'er so much disgrac'd,</br>As on that luckless, ill-protected Day,</br>When all your Force was try'd in vain!</br>Why, Gunnings, would you not your Tea apply?</br>Careful of some happy Swain,</br>You let poor unregarded Chloe die?", "Each fragrant Flower, and ev'ry shady Grove,</br>Where the dear Wanton us'd to rove,</br>Fade, as a Mark of their departed Love!</br>Thou lonesome Cushion, where she us'd to lie,</br>No more shall she bedeck thy Crimson Dye:</br>Here, Muses, tho' it was not in your Pow'r</br>To shield her in the sad distressful Hour,</br>When she gave up her Breath,</br>Yet to her Memory plait a living Wreath,</br>You whose sad Accents wept at Marble-Hall,</br>O'er the great Suffolk's little Fav'rite's Fall.</br>O let your Lyres lament my Chloe gone,</br>With the same deep, majestic rueful Tone.</br>"]
