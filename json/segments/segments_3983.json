["O!  Ye nymphs come and carol away,</br>Sweep loudly the joy-giving lyre,</br>Come, and join the heart-flowing lay,</br>For my Phyllis has lent a kind ear.</br>But see her bright form now advance,</br>Her presence all nature can cheer,</br>See the maidens who move in the dance</br>Come trooping to join the career.", "What charms I descry in the face</br>Of the too lovely nymph I adore;</br>Such charms to descry I could gaze,</br>Till gazing itself was no more.</br>O!  queen of the flow'ry tribe,</br>What's become of thy delicate hue?</br>Does Phyllis thy beauties imbibe?</br>'Tis she can thy beauties renew.", "For the maids of her train I declare</br>Are no more to compare with my love,</br>That Ida's bright nymphs can compare</br>With the queen of the Cyprian grove.</br>Then let not my fair one repine,</br>Nor doubt that her shepherd dare prove</br>To a maid so engaging, so kind,</br>The wretch who is fickle in love.", "Let me wander thro' desarts forlorn,</br>Not a friend to beguile the dull way,</br>Where Sol with rapidity born,</br>Too nearly directs his hot ray.</br>Over snow-crowned heights let me rove,</br>Where the face of bright Sol never glows;</br>When temper'd by Phyllis's love,</br>All the labours of life seem repose.", "As Eurus' chill blast oft is found</br>To deprive of their bloom ev'ry tree,</br>So the force of my Phyllida's frown</br>Bears away all enjoyment from me.</br>Then why the fond passion forbear?</br>Why to far distant realms shou'd I fly?</br>'Tis in vain to depart &mdash; even there</br>Does my Phyllis her presence deny.", "Not a line of that face I declare</br>But on Corydon's breast my be seen;</br>I wou'd try, yet I cannot compare</br>One who rivals the Cyprian queen.</br>Ev'ry thought that occurs to my mind</br>Bids the form of lov'd Phyllida rise,</br>Nor can absence a fair so refin'd,</br>E'er diminish in Corydon's eyes.</br>"]
