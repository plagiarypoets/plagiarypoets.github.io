["Clothed in a splendid garb of green and gold,</br>Her blue eyes beaming beautiful and bright,</br>Radiant and rich, and lovely to behold,</br>Majestic Summer mounts her throne of light.</br>Exulting Nature hails the auspicious sight,</br>And all her tuneful tribes their homage pay&mdash;</br>Even cheerful looks the mountain's barren height,</br>And every valley, pranked with flowrets gay,</br>Breaths exquisite perfumes that zephyr wafts away.", "O come, my Friend &mdash; where yonder crystal stream</br>Meanders cool beneath the willow shade,</br>Now let us saunter &mdash; shun the sultry beam,</br>And court the breeze that flutters through the glade.</br>From every bough, with mingled serenade,</br>The feather'd choir regale the listening ear,</br>And buzzing insects ply their busy trade,</br>Collecting timely store for future cheer,</br>When chilling storms again shall blast the drooping year.", "And see!  the blooming hawthorn to her bower</br>Up yonder verdant slope, our visit woos,</br>When down the west bright day's departing power,</br>Paints every passing cloud with brilliant hues;</br>Opening still varied and delightful views,</br>To charm the curious eye, on every side&mdash;</br>'Tis Summer's invitation to the Muse,</br>While Nature spreads her sumptuous table wide,</br>And o'er the sweet repast bids lovely Eve preside.", "Can'st thou the rapture such a scene inspires</br>Suppress in silence?  no!  thy sparkling eye</br>Tells me thou can'st not, ere the nascent fires</br>Of Feeling from thy lip permit reply.</br>Then seize the lyre, and wake its melody</br>In concert with the warblers all around,</br>And chaunt the beauties of earth, air, and sky,</br>Till Echo, starting from her steep profound,</br>Catch the ecstatic notes, and rock and cave resound.</br>"]
