["I.</br>O Gentle, feather-footed Sleep,</br>In drowsy Dews my Temples steep;</br>Softly waving o'er my Head,</br>The Care-beguiling Rod of Lead:</br>O leave thy Bed of balmy Flow'rs,</br>And waken all thy dewy Pow'rs,</br>And wafted on the silent Wing,</br>The Dreams, thy little People bring!", "II.</br>Let sobbing Grief, and midnight Feast,</br>Comus, and loudly-laughing Jest,</br>Never near my Couch appear,</br>Nor whistling Whirlwinds wound my Ear,</br>In Heav'n's avenging Anger sent,</br>To shake the shatter'd Battlement,</br>From whence the melancholy Owl,</br>To wake the Wolf is wont to howl:", "III.</br>But whispering Show'rs from off the Eaves,</br>Softly dripping on the Leaves,</br>Mix'd with the mildly-stirring Wind,</br>Shall woo to rest my weary Mind;</br>Now Silence o'er the midnight Ground,</br>Slowly walks his solemn Round,</br>In Mead or Forest, Dale or Hill,</br>Commanding Nature to be still.", "IV.</br>Kind Somnus, from the lofty Dome</br>To my low Cottage deign to come,</br>Leave murd'rous Tyrants' silken Beds,</br>No Poppies pour on guilty Heads.</br>While wailing Ghosts their Slumbers break,</br>That round their trembling Curtains shriek,</br>While Thoughts of many a Wretch opprest,</br>With Terror tear the troubled Breast.", "V.</br>Cramm'd with distressful Bread, the Hind</br>With weary Limbs and vacant Mind,</br>By buzzing Night-Flies husht, requires</br>No lulling Sounds from Lydian Lyres;</br>Rock'd on the high and giddy Mast,</br>Regardless of the wint'ry Blast,</br>How happy the wet Sea-boy lies,</br>While sweetest Slumbers seal his Eyes.", "VI.</br>Such Joys the virtuous Bosom crown,</br>While Kings and Statesmen toss on Down:</br>Somnus, to me such Joys impart,</br>Balm of hurt Minds, O sooth my Heart:</br>Lapt in the Folds of soft Repose,</br>We lose our Labours, Pangs, and Woes;</br>Thy opiate Influence we bless,</br>Parent of Forgetfulness!", "VII.</br>Place me, kind God, in lively Dream</br>Near smooth Ilissus' winding Stream.</br>In Olive-shade, with ravisht Ear,</br>While Plato's Voice I seem to hear:</br>Or from the green, Athenian Mead</br>To the high Roman Forum lead,</br>Where Tully's Tongue with Force divine</br>Confounds pale, trembling Cataline.</br>"]
