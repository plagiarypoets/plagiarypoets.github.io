["Come, gentle Peace, celestial maid!</br>Come from the lonely silent shade,</br>With all thy smiling train,</br>Contentment blythe, and rosy Health,</br>With Innocence, the peasant's wealth,</br>And visit me again!", "Long has my anxious lab'ring breast,</br>Oppress'd with woes, forgot the rest</br>Thy presence once inspir'd:</br>O wave thy olive o'er my soul,</br>Bid all its tumults cease to roll,</br>And bring the calm desir'd!", "I see thee radiant on the throne</br>Where sits the great redeeming Son,</br>Jesu, the Prince of Peace!</br>He speaks, and straight I see thee fly</br>Thro' all the mansions of the sky,</br>And angels feel the grace.", "Lo!  he descends to Bethleh'm's inn,</br>His mortal race there to begin;</br>I see thee in his train!</br>Descending in a flood of day,</br>The angel-choirs assume the lay,</br>And swell the raptur'd strain:", "\"Hail, favour'd men!  with joy attend,</br>Peace and Benevolence descend</br>To bless your longing eyes!\"</br>The ravish'd shepherds catch the sound,</br>Resume the reed, and round and round</br>The joyful echo flies.", "Blest gift of heav'n!  balm of the mind!</br>Deign still to bless the human kind,</br>Nor leave the earth again:</br>Bid surly war and discord dire,</br>Bid sorrow wipe his tearful eye,</br>And drop his plaintive strain.", "Bid Husbandry assume again</br>His plough and whistle on the plain,</br>To animate the toil;</br>Free from the rage of wasteful war,</br>May he drive home the loaded ear,</br>Fraught with the bounteous soil!", "Beneath thy smile bid Science rise,</br>And shoot his thoughts up to the skies,</br>With big ideas fraught;</br>Bid busy Commerce swell her sail,</br>And pour her wealth o'er all our isle,</br>From distant Indies brought.", "Thro' regal breasts thy calm diffuse,</br>Direct the politician's views,</br>To peace too oft a foe:</br>Make ev'ry man his neighbour's friend,</br>Then all the ills of life shall end,</br>And heav'n begin below.</br>"]
