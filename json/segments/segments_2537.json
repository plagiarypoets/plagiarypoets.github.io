["Hail mild-ey'd morn, for thou art soft and fair</br>As breaks upon the bosom of the day,</br>Where the blue violet bears</br>Her bosom to the breeze.", "Come, and the light-wing'd spring shall drop a smile,</br>Sweet Premature!  nurs'd on old Winter's breast,</br>Shall lift her blue-soft eye,</br>And wanton in the beam.", "Lamp of the wintry world, thou Heav'n-lit Sun,</br>Oh!  haste and woo the young reluctant maid,</br>And bid her humid lip</br>Drop with the ripen'd balm.", "Come chaste-ey'd God while yet the ice-hung clouds</br>Around thy throne in wintry glory ride,</br>The Virgin loves thy flight</br>While yet its blaze is dimm'd.", "For soon, where glowing with the ardent fire</br>Of strong-soul'd passion, lo the seraph mind</br>Shrinks from the solar noon,</br>Gathers the sweets, and flies.", "Propitious morn, my melancholy muse</br>Drops her cold tear upon the bloomless earth,</br>Reflecting man like thee</br>May totter to his tomb.", "Yet even when Summer's flushing cheek was full,</br>I've seen the pale rose wither on her thorn,</br>And shrink, like injur'd worth</br>From sullen scornful pride.</br>"]
