["Furies!  Why sleep amid the carnage? &mdash; Rise!</br>Bring up my wolves of war, my pointed spears,</br>Daggers yet reeking, banners fill'd with sighs,</br>And paint your cheeks with gore, and lave your locks in tears.</br>On yon white bosom see that happy child!</br>Seize it, deface its infant charms!  and say,</br>Anarchy view'd its mangled limbs, and smil'd!</br>Strike the young mother to the earth! &mdash; Away!</br>This is my era!  O'er the dead I go!</br>From my hot nostrils minute murders fall!</br>Behind my burning car lurks feeble woe!</br>Fill'd with my dragon's ire, my slaves for kingdoms call!</br>Hear them not, father of the ensanguin'd race!&mdash;</br>World!  give my monsters way! &mdash; Death!  keep thy steady chase!", "What howlings wake me! &mdash; my fair olives die!</br>Storms shake my bow'r, and drive me to the plain.&mdash;</br>Ah!  direful Anarchy, thy chariots fly</br>O'er worlds of weeping babes, o'er world of heroes slain!</br>Order!  Bright angel down yon rainbow glide!</br>From the mild bosom of my God appear!</br>O'er Gallia spread thy showy pinions wide:</br>O!  cool the fever'd mind!  and whisper to despair.</br>Envenom'd and unwelcome war!  will man</br>Long nurse thy furies or prolong thy stay?</br>Will not his fine, reflective spirit scan</br>Those desolations that have mark'd thy way?</br>Yes! &mdash; He shall wearied leave thy crimes, and prove,</br>All that is worthy man, is found with me and love.</br>"]
