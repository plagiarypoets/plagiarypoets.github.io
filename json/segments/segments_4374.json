["Where is my friend? &mdash; I tho't I held him fast!</br>But yesterday, we, wandering side by side,</br>O'er the rough, sloping highlands blithly pass'd,</br>In the wild converse of poetic pride&mdash;</br>Marking the varied landscape spreading wide,</br>With many a rural scene and rustic cot,</br>Where Nature's sons or Nature's charms abide,</br>Rude as the primal race! &mdash; repining not,</br>No vagrant wish extends beyond their natal sport.", "But cheerful as their sires have lived and died,</br>Contentedly they pass a life obscure,</br>Amid the wild scenes on the mountain's side&mdash;</br>Themselves as wild, as simple, and as pure;&mdash;</br>To them ambition holds no witching lure,</br>Nor wealth excites an avaricious flame;</br>In nature's bodeless ignorance secure,</br>Their father's merit is their highest aim&mdash;</br>Their father's ancient cottage, all they wish to claim.", "Yes, Sheys, with thee but yesterday I stray'd</br>O'er Rockaway's romantic, upland vale,</br>Where many a scene sublime our course delay'd,</br>And oft we paus'd to bear the rustic's tale,</br>Or list the roar of waters on the gale;</br>While fancy, all enraptur'd, gazed and smil'd,</br>O'er the inspiring view, which could not fail</br>To wake the song of genius' favour'd child,</br>And rudely thou didst pour thy numbers warm and wild.", "From the rough mountain's brow, with slow descent,</br>Leaping from rock to rock in sportive play,</br>Along thy shores, rude Rockaway, we went,</br>In social observation, blithe and gay,</br>Tuning at times the voluntary lay;</br>Or climbing the steep cliff in curious mood,</br>To mark thy wild, uneven, winding way,</br>And there awhile in contemplation stood,</br>Gazing upon the grandeur of thy foaming flood!", "But who can pencil the stupendous scene,</br>Where from the precipice the waters pour&mdash;</br>All wildly rushing the huge rocks between,</br>Plunge foaming, breaking, jarring, thundering o'er,</br>And lash the torturing crags with angry roar;</br>Now wheeling in one hoary sheet along,</br>As tho' indignant of their narrow shore;</br>Now gathering in a current fierce and strong,</br>Struggling, they darkly wind, the clifts obscure among.", "There, in romantic grandeur, o'er the deep,</br>The promontory cliff sublimely bends;</br>Here, slow receding, the umbrageous steep,</br>Abrupt, in gay theatric form ascends,</br>Towers in the rear and with the mountain blends,</br>Or from its brow by Nature's hand unfurl'd,</br>Gently declines, and thro' the vale extends;&mdash;</br>There, pile on pile the massy rocks are hurl'd,</br>Like the rude, gather'd fragments of a ruin'd world.", "And shall such charms of Nature lie unsung?</br>O, Booneton!  Booneton! &mdash; Lovely vale retir'd;</br>Is there no Bard, thy mountain sons among,</br>With Nature's warm enthusiasm fir'd,</br>Upon thy cataract to gaze inspir'd,</br>And, like the genius of the mountain tide,</br>Sing his wild numbers &mdash; by the world admir'd,</br>Rude as the scene he laves &mdash; as free from pride&mdash;</br>His soul as nobly bold &mdash; his accents as untied.", "In full sublimity, the Poet's eye</br>Beholds Niagara's mighty torrent flow,</br>As rushing furious from its bed on high,</br>It pours a deluge on the world below!</br>Or turning, ses like drifting clouds of snow,</br>O'er awful rocks Passaic burst away;</br>But Booneton, less sublime, can more bestow,</br>Of beauteous scenery picturesque and gay,</br>Where the romantic eye may long unwearied stray.", "Nor lacks there story for this lovely spot:&mdash;</br>The sympathetic Bard may truly tell,</br>(For generous deed should never be forgot,)</br>How from the giddy height Eliza fell,</br>Down!  down!  she sunk!  and with a rushing swell</br>The tide collaps'd!  and smooth, and waveless died!</br>While from the shore loud burst the frantic yell:&mdash;</br>She's gone!  she's gone! &mdash; united voices cried!&mdash;</br>She's gone!  the echoing rocks in hollow wail replied.", "Then brave Doremus, from the shelving steep,</br>With nature's true philanthropy of heart,</br>Plung'd in the whirling basin of the deep,</br>And all again was still!  With anxious start,</br>They who remain'd rush on!  The waters part!</br>Clasping the maid, amidst the surges' roar</br>Doremus rose, and with opposing art,</br>Beating the waves, magnanimously bore</br>His lovely, drooping prize, triumphant to the shore!", "O, Booneton!  in thy sweet vale, where peace resides!</br>Could my heart claim a spark of Genius' fire;</br>Full oft should bear me on its upland sides,</br>While echoes warbled to my mountain lyre,</br>Sweeping the wild notes from its trembling wire;</br>Or wandering oft thy rushing stream along,</br>The scenes sublime should many a strain inspire,</br>And in rude minstrelsy thy hills among,</br>I'd pour thy native grandeur in the tide of song.</br>"]
