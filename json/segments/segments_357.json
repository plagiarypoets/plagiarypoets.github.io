["To move the springs of nature as we please,</br>To think with spirit, but to write with ease:</br>With living words to warm the conscious heart,</br>Or please the soul with nicer charms of art,</br>For this the Grecian soar'd in Epic strains,</br>And softer Maro left the Mantuan plains:</br>Melodious Spenser felt the lover's fire,</br>And awful Milton strung his heav'nly lyre.", "'Tis yours, like these, with curious toil to trace</br>The pow'rs of language, harmony, and grace,</br>How nature's self with living lustre shines;</br>How judgment strengthens, and how art refines,</br>How to grow bold with conscious sense of fame,</br>And force a pleasure which we dare not blame:</br>To charm us more thro' negligence than pains,</br>And give ev'n life and action to the strains:</br>Led by some law, whose pow'rful impulse guides</br>Each happy stroke, and in the soul presides:</br>Some fairer image of perfection, giv'n</br>T' inspire mankind, itself deriv'd from heav'n.", "O ever worthy, ever crown'd with praise;</br>Blest in thy life, and blest in all thy lays!</br>Add that the Sisters ev'ry thought refine:</br>Or ev'n thy life be faultless as thy line;</br>Yet envy still with fiercer rage pursues,</br>Obscures the virtue, and defames the muse.</br>A soul like thine, in pains, in grief resign'd,</br>Views with vain scorn the malice of mankind:</br>Not critics, but their planets prove unjust:</br>And are they blam'd who sin because they must?", "Yet sure not so must all peruse thy lays;</br>I cannot rival &mdash; and yet dare to praise.</br>A thousand charms at once my thoughts engage,</br>Sappho's soft sweetness, Pindar's warmer rage,</br>Statius' free vigour, Virgil's studious care,</br>And Homer's force, and Ovid's easier air.", "So seems some Picture, where exact design,</br>And curious pains, and strength and sweetness join:</br>Where the free thought its pleasing grace bestows,</br>And each warm stroke with living colour glows:</br>Soft without weakness, without labour fair;</br>Wrought up at once with happiness and care!", "How blest the man that from the world removes</br>To joys that MORDAUNT, or his POPE approves;</br>Whose taste exact each author can explore,</br>And live the present and past ages o'er:</br>Who free from pride, from penitence, or strife,</br>Move calmly forward to the verge of life:</br>Such be my days, and such my fortunes be,</br>To live by reason, and to write by thee!", "Nor deem this verse, tho' humble, thy disgrace;</br>All are not born the glory of their race:</br>Yet all are born t' adore the great man's name,</br>And trace his footsteps in the paths to fame.</br>The Muse who now this early homage pays,</br>First learn'd from thee to animate her lays:</br>A Muse as yet unhonour'd, but unstain'd,</br>Who prais'd no vices, no preferment gain'd:</br>Unbyass'd or to censure or commend,</br>Who knows no envy, and who grieves no friend;</br>Perhaps too fond to make those virtues known,</br>And fix her fame immortal on thy own.</br>"]
