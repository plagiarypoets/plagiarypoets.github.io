["Hail, LIBERTY!  celestial maid,</br>To ev'ry free-born Briton dear,</br>In beauteous robes of light array'd,</br>With all thy radiant train appear:</br>To thee, on this auspicious day,</br>We raise the votive, solemn lay;</br>Smit with thy charms &mdash; thy energy divine,</br>The wond'ring nations round in one vast chorus join.", "Enamour'd of thy lovely form,</br>Thy smile our fathers fondly sought;</br>Thro' fields of slain, thro' ev'ry storm,</br>For thee with noble ardour fought:</br>With Glory's fire their bosoms burn'd,</br>The Despot's awful threats they scorn'd;</br>Not thro' wild ages was the contest vain&mdash;</br>Heav'n heard their fervent prayer, and broke their galling chain.", "Nurs'd in their fens by Belgia's sons,</br>'Twas there thy youth to vigour rose;</br>'Twas there thou check'dst the tyrant's frowns,</br>And triumph'd o'er th' embattled foes:</br>With blooming wreaths of olive crown'd,</br>'Twas there thou spreadst thy gifts around;</br>Till rous'd by Britain's tears, by Britain's cries,</br>Thou left thy low-sunk shores for far more genial skies.", "On that blest day, when WILLIAM sail'd</br>Advent'rous o'er the azure main,</br>When warring winds no more prevail'd,</br>And storms of faction rag'd in vain;</br>'Twas then, with beaming lustre bright,</br>Thy form amaz'd th' enraptur'd sight;</br>'Twas then you calmly sat and steer'd the helm,</br>To save a sinking state, and raise this happy realm.", "And when, on Albion's billow'd shore,</br>Thine awful ensigns were unfurl'd,</br>Oppression's voice was heard no more,</br>And Glory gave thee to the world;</br>'Twas then you plac'd on Britain's throne,</br>Thy fav'rite's standard, and thine own;</br>With all thy gifts to bless this sea-girt isle,</br>And charm each distant age with thy reviving smile.", "Twice fifty suns have seen thy reign,</br>With arts of peace and honours bless'd;</br>With all the Graces in thy train,</br>In all their fairest vestments dress'd:</br>By thee the Muses tune the lay,</br>Enraptur'd with thy gentle sway;</br>By thee the pencil bids the canvas swell,</br>And music strikes the lyre, or wakes the vocal shell.", "'Tis thine to cheer the peasant's toil,</br>In summer's drought, in winter's storms;</br>To guard his cultur'd fields the while,</br>From Danger's frowns, and War's alarms:</br>'Tis thine to bid our harvest rise</br>Wide waving to th' autumnal skies;</br>'Tis thine to send, with white-spread sails unfurl'd,</br>Our commerce and our trade around the world.", "But chief, RELIGION!  at thy shrine,</br>With grateful hearts we lowly bend;</br>To thee we owe our joys divine,</br>On thee our sweetest hopes depend:</br>No Romish zeal, with impious hand,</br>Shakes uncontroul'd her fiery brand,</br>Nor Persecution, in his madd'ning rage,</br>With savage slaughter, stains the annals of the age.", "But rising fair at Freedom's sway,</br>Here heav'nly Peace in beauty blooms;</br>And sacred Truth, with purest ray,</br>The dark, benighted mind illumes;</br>While far beyond the bounds of time,</br>Exults the soul with views sublime,</br>With rapture eyes her future bright abode,</br>Where shines her Father's face, and her redeeming God.", "BRITAIN!  from all thy shores around</br>Let the glad voice of praise arise;</br>Thy verdant vales repeat the sound,</br>Thy cities waft it to the skies:</br>May sons unborn prolong the lay,</br>And oft proclaim this glorious day;</br>And, bless'd with LIBERTY'S endearing train,</br>May latest ages hail RELIGION'S peaceful reign!</br>"]
