["Adieu to my flocks of white sheep,</br>And adieu to the vales where they fed</br>For though many the tears that I weep,</br>The devil a tear have they shed!", "Ye lambs and ye lambkins adieu,</br>From the Leasowes your poet is off;</br>Farewell to each ram and each ewe,</br>For I've got a most damnable cough!", "The devil may watch you for me,</br>I'm sure he'll be sick of the job!</br>For your Corydon's off, do you see,</br>Without ever sobbing a sob.</br>"]
