["Mild as the star-beam on the silent wave,</br>Soft as the tints of yon etherial bow,</br>That bends its bright arch o'er the dark concave,</br>And bids the storm its destined limit know,</br>Do thou, Content, with equal step sedate,</br>Rise o'er the mind's dim clouds, and break the storms of Fate!", "O!  welcome as the spirit of the morn,</br>Whose diamond eyes prelude a golden day,</br>Choir'd by the linnets from the blossom'd thorn,</br>The green hill yellowing in her dewy ray,</br>As o'er its timid bosom soft she glides,</br>Silvering the winding rill, that warbles down its sides!", "While, with a loosen'd zone, gay Pleasure strays,</br>Crowning with rosy wreaths the frolic hours,</br>While busy Fame collects immortal bays,</br>And Hope reclines in amaranthine bowers,</br>Round thee, Content, health-breathing sweets exhale,</br>As crops thy gentle hand yon lilies of the vale.", "On fair HONORA may thy influence shine</br>For her thy cheek with purest blushes glow!</br>More does she prize one halcyon plume of thine</br>Than all that decks Ambition's jewel'd brow.</br>Near her may thy light steps perpetual rove</br>With the associate forms of Fancy, Truth, and Love!</br>"]
