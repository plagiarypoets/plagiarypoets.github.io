["Spirit of Beauty!  were it not for thee,</br>I would not gaze one hour on Nature's face,</br>How great so'er her wondrous works might be;</br>Nor yet desire to traverse boundless space,</br>Exploring all things, wheresoe'er a trace</br>Of wisdom, power, or goodness, meets the eye.</br>Thou hold'st the universe in thy embrace!&mdash;</br>The rolling earth! &mdash; the burning spheres on high!</br>And all those worlds of light that wander through the sky.", "Spirit of Beauty!  in a foreign land,</br>I've seen thee mingle with the noontide sun,</br>And o'er both earth and ocean wave thy hand;</br>And when that glorious orb its course had run,</br>And night's more silent, solemn reign begun,</br>I've seen thee with the pale moon mount the skies,</br>As if mankind, and earth, thou might'st to shun,</br>So high in azure heaven thou seem'st to rise;</br>But back again thou cam'st to dwell in woman's eyes!", "Spirit of Beauty!  may thou still prevail,</br>And o'er both Time and Ruin keep thy sway!</br>Though man's divinest works these may assail,</br>And with defacing fingers work decay,</br>Thou hast a power more mighty yet than they&mdash;</br>Pervading nature, and enlivening all;&mdash;</br>Thou mak'st more beautiful the ruins grey</br>Than princely palace, with its stately hall;</br>Witness the ivy'd tower, the garland-cover'd wall.", "Spirit of Beauty!  Woman's lovely form</br>Is thy fit temple, and thy fairest shrine;</br>Thou mayst take shelter there 'mid every storm</br>That darkens o'er this earth, no more divine.</br>Although in worlds above thy light may shine,</br>The brightness that thou giv'st to woman's eyes</br>Eclipseth all those heavenly orbs of thine;</br>To view the radiant soul that in them lies,</br>'Tis said that angels have been known to leave the skies.</br>"]
