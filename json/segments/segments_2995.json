["Here worth exalted undistinguish'd lies,</br>No stone, alas!  to claim one grateful tear;</br>Yet Fame shall sound his plaudit in the skies,</br>Whilst list'ning angels hush their hymns to hear.", "True worth alone his monument shall prove,</br>No marble need be rear'd his praise to tell;</br>Yet 'twere but just that those who felt his love,</br>Should pay some tribute to his God-like zeal.", "Should proud Ambition sleep beneath the tomb</br>Of pomp and state, to catch the public eye,</br>While a rude grave alone shall prove his doom</br>Who fell a victim to Humanity?", "Forbid it!  ev'ry virtue of the soul,</br>Forbid it!  Justice, from thy sacred throne;</br>Let some inscription, form'd to speak the whole,</br>Proclaim his merit on some humble stone.", "And, that Necessity may prove no plea,</br>Accept these lines, though homely, yet sincere;</br>For, ah!  did each spectator feel like me,</br>Not one would quit his grave without a tear.", "EPITAPH.</br>Beneath this stone \"The Man of Feeling\" lies,</br>Humanity had marked him for her own:</br>His virtue rais'd him to his native skies</br>Ere half his merit to the world was known.", "In health and full-blown prime he nobly dy'd,</br>To save a drowning youth he dar'd the wave;</br>But, ere his throbbing bosom well had sigh'd,</br>Th' obdurate Avon prov'd their mutual grave.", "O'er his remains, ah!  drop one grateful tear,</br>For far from kindred and from friends he lies;</br>No parent strew'd his solitary bier,</br>No kind relation clos'd his clay-cold eyes.</br>"]
