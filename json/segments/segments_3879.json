["Avaunt, thou fiend!  thou haggard sprite,</br>Attendant on the shades of night!</br>When screech-owls haunt the solemn scene,</br>And shadows tremble o'er the green,</br>Thou stand'st erect, with bristly hair,</br>And wring'st the soul with wild despair.", "Where Danger, 'mid the howling storm,</br>Assumes his fell terrific form;</br>Where Vengeance, with her hideous brood,</br>And Indignation, thirst for blood;</br>Thou, 'mid the wreck, uprear'st thy head,</br>Fraught with the poignant pangs of dread.", "Him, whom remorseful grief and fear,</br>With Conscience' gnawing tumults tear,</br>Tho' golden canopies surround</br>His head, with regal badges crown'd;</br>Not all his dignity, nor art,</br>Can screen from thy relentless dart.", "The murd'ring thief along the glade</br>Beholds the visionary shade:</br>Where'er he turns his wand'ring eyes,</br>Thro' ev'ry bush the phantom flies;</br>His heart's a prey to grim despair&mdash;</br>For HORROR sits triumphant there!</br>"]
