["Alas!  for the Oak of our Fathers, that stood</br>In its beauty, the glory and pride of the wood!", "It grew and it flourish'd for many an age,</br>And many a tempest wreak'd on it its rage;</br>But when its strong branches were bent with the blast,</br>It struck its roots deeper and flourish'd more fast.", "Its head tower'd high, and its branches spread round,</br>For its roots were struck deep, and its heart it was sound;</br>The bees o'er its honey-dew'd foliage play'd,</br>And the beasts of the forest fed under its shade.", "The Oak of our fathers to freedom was dear,</br>Its leaves were her crown, and its wood was her spear.</br>Alas for the Oak of our fathers that stood,</br>In its beauty, the glory and pride of the wood.", "There crept up an Ivy and clung round its trunk,</br>It struck in its mouths, and its juices it drunk;</br>The branches grew sickly, depriv'd of their food,</br>And the Oak was no longer the pride of the wood.", "The Foresters saw and they gather'd around,</br>Its roots still were fast, and its heart still was sound;</br>The lopt off the boughs that so beautiful spread,</br>But the Ivy they spared on its vitals that fed.", "No longer the bees o'er its honey-dews play'd,</br>Nor the beasts of the forest fed under its shade;</br>Lopt and mangled the trunk in its ruin is seen,</br>A monument now what its beauty has been.", "The Oak has receiv'd its incurable wound</br>They have loosen'd the roots, though the heart may be sound,</br>What the trav'llers at distance green flourishing see,</br>Are the leaves of the Ivy that ruin'd the tree.", "Alas!  for the Oak of our fathers that stood,</br>In its beauty, the glory and pride of the wood.</br>"]
