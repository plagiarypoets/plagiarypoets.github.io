["Pale Indians shiver at their fire,</br>The dazzling snow our eye-balls stun,</br>The skaters from the cold retire,</br>The water freezes in the sun,</br>And yonder cataract displays</br>From columns Iris' golden rays;</br>But Gratitude, sweet smiling guest,</br>The chilling cold expels and warms my throbbing breast.", "Hail Gratitude, soft-blushing maid,</br>By gods and men alike belov'd,</br>Despatch'd to gentle Virtue's aid,</br>To make her duties more approv'd;</br>With Goodness tripping on before,</br>You guide her to the wretched door;</br>Again behind you hold her train,</br>Smile off her cautious fears and shake your golden chain.", "Anon you lead the heavenly choir,</br>The sainted host in rapture gaze,</br>You strike with love th' eternal lyre;</br>And sound delightful notes of praise;</br>While angels from on high proclaim</br>That men may join th' ecstatick theme,</br>To Gratitude alone is given,</br>The thankful soul of man to raise from earth to heaven.", "The offerings of a grateful heart,</br>O waft benignant nymph divine,</br>To B&mdash; some pleasure thou'lt impart,</br>At sacred Truth's refreshing shrine;</br>For there he studies Nature's page,</br>Or saunters with Sicilia's sage,</br>Admires the depth of Bacon's mind,</br>And Newton lifting Nature's veil that kept us blind.", "Perhaps his mind illum'd portrays,</br>From systems free the human race;</br>The native worth that man displays,</br>His various sources of distress,</br>By Freedom blest, a demi-god,</br>A beast when rul'd by Nero's rod,</br>And all his frame with ardour glows,</br>To sooth with healing balm, or banish mortal woes.", "O Truth, enrob'd in snowy white,</br>Your fav'rite's modest doubts dispel,</br>That he may spread your precious light,</br>And then inspire a nobler shell</br>To sound aloud his glorious name,</br>To class him with the sons of fame,</br>While Gratitude, celestial guide,</br>Each heart inspires to hail, their country's boast and pride.</br>"]
