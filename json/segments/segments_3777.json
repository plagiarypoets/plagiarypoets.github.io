["Colin, a Raw, but Heady Swain,</br>That tended Sheep upon the Plain,</br>Scarce knew the Terms of Hoi-Go-Ho,</br>Or when the Team should Stop or Go,</br>What Season's proper for to Plough,</br>What Ground to Fallow, what to Sow,</br>Or how to Cheapen, Sell, or Buy,</br>Or any Parts of Husbandry;</br>Being once hir'd to Widow Scot,</br>Who own'd much Land, and Farm'd to boot,</br>Grew vain, and fancy'd he could do</br>A Thousand Things he never knew:</br>The stupid Louts amaz'd to see</br>Colin advanc'd to such Degree,</br>Cry'd out, Sure he is something more</br>Than Country Volk do take him for.</br>The cunning Yeomen smoak'd the Bite,</br>And sneer'd the Widow's Want of Wit,</br>And o'er a Cup of Nappy Ale</br>Would crack a Jest and merry Tale</br>Of Colin's Blunders and his Cheats,</br>With many other pretty Feats;</br>How carelessly he us'd to keep</br>His private Stock, and Parish Sheep,</br>But rather than his private Stock</br>Should want, he'd borrow from the Flock:</br>Besides, how Colin once had been</br>Thought Tardy, but set right again,</br>It being his good Luck to keep</br>A Dog that strongly smelt of Sheep,</br>And when the Uproar first was heard,</br>Poor Mouse was hang'd, and Colin clear'd.</br>No sooner Colin settled was,</br>But threw th' Old Servants out of Place;</br>Old Cid, the Hind, was first discharg'd,</br>Who had the Rents and Fines enlarg'd;</br>Colin went briskly on below,</br>The Widow seldom car'd to know</br>Whate'er was done, so Gip and She</br>Might have their Syrup and their Tea:</br>This Gip, an ugly dowdy Jade,</br>Whom Widow Scot familiar made,</br>And had prefer'd from Milking-Pail</br>To Dress her Head, and Pin her Tail,</br>Had stol'n away the Widow's Heart,</br>That they could never be apart:</br>This Gip and Colin had combin'd</br>To keep the Widow warm, and blind:</br>The House thus modell'd, all Things went</br>Swimming, and to their Heart's Content,</br>And all was Colin's Management.</br>Such great Concerns in Colin's Hand,</br>Still often put him to the Stand;</br>He'd fain have kept some Servants in,</br>T' have learned by them to Manage fine,</br>They swore he trick'd, and would not joyn:</br>So he was forc'd to ask Advice</br>Of those he thought not very Wise.</br>The Farm, in Time, grew course and wild,</br>The Fences broke, made but one Field;</br>The Cattle dy'd for Want of Care;</br>And ev'ry Thing out of Repair:</br>The Stock, both Quick and Dead, was sold,</br>And Colin still kept all the Gold;</br>He took up Sums at Twelve per Cent,</br>When all before at Five had lent;</br>But yet he, uncontroul'd, went on,</br>And, with Success, being harden'd grown,</br>At Harvest turns off Carter John,</br>And puts in James, a Parish Boy,</br>A good Condition'd Youth, but Raw;</br>James Driving of an heavy Load,</br>Thro' a strait Lane, and miry Road,</br>Not knowing when to use his Whip,</br>The Horses stand, then frisk and leap,</br>And over-set the Load of Wheat,</br>That James was bruis'd in his Retreat:</br>The Village hooted when they found</br>The Wheat so spoil'd, the Carter shunn'd;</br>They forthwith to the Widow went</br>With, This is Colin's Management:</br>The Widow, frighted at the Cry,</br>Begg'd they'd some present Help apply,</br>And bid them haste for Carter John,</br>The Man she must rely upon.</br>Colin, with all his Scoundrel Crew,</br>The Rabble's Rage and Village flew.</br>"]
