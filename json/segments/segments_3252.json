["Say, shepherds, since Corydon's dead,</br>What music can gladden your plains!</br>The pride of Simplicity's fled,</br>And fled are the pastoral strains.", "When Nature's gay aspect declin'd,</br>Nor verdure around you was seen,</br>'Twas he that retain'd on your mind</br>The tints of the daisy-deck'd green.", "His music &mdash; how artless and sweet,</br>When piping your rural abode:</br>And if the gay seasons he'd greet,</br>With rapture your bosoms have glow'd.", "He gave you the softest solace,</br>If virgins he rang'd in a scene;</br>For elegance, beauty and grace,</br>They rivall'd the Cyprian Queen.", "When morn's rosy reign he'd explore,</br>What imagery wou'd he display!</br>Then make the wing'd foresters soar,</br>To welcome the chariot of day.", "The violet, the woodbine, and rose,</br>And others &mdash; the pride of the flow'rs,</br>In chaplets he'd aptly dispose,</br>To deck the gay nymphs in your bow'rs.", "Oft to the fond swains he defin'd,</br>The merits of friendship and love;</br>And bade them \"(in sooth he was kind,\")</br>For constancy look to the dove.", "Benificence glow'd in his lays,&mdash;</br>An alien his bosom to strife;</br>He rose to the summit of praise,</br>He dropt 'ere the winter of life.", "Go, shepherds, his numbers rehearse,</br>Some allay for your grief you will find;</br>And still, by his elegant verse,</br>A transcript retain of his mind.</br>"]
