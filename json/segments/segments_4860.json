["The mother knelt beside her dying son&mdash;</br>There was no flush upon her cheek &mdash; her eye</br>With pearly tears was gemm'd not &mdash; in it shone</br>No furious grief-lit passion to defy</br>The will of him enthron'd amid the sky.</br>He was her only son, her last, her best,</br>On whom she'd lov'd to lean and to rely&mdash;</br>Her fears were ne'er awaken'd by request</br>Of him, who would, ere long, be one among the blest.", "She knelt beside him, and tho' tears came not,</br>Deep, madd'ning woe, within that lonely breast</br>Held sway uncheck'd &mdash; and now and then there shot</br>From that dark eye, soon to be clos'd in rest,</br>A ling'ring spark of pity &mdash; 'twas the test!</br>She, that lone mother, felt it in her woe&mdash;</br>Her lips refus'd her agoniz'd behest,</br>And there she knelt, half praying, soon to know</br>All joy was grief to her, all desolate below.", "She rais'd him from his couch, his paly face</br>Brighten'd a moment with expiring ray;</br>But soon it fled, and consciousness apace,</br>The mandate bore its trembling breath away.</br>Oh!  I have seen the friendless kneel and pray,</br>An orphan mourn his earthly blessings fled,</br>The husband weep o'er her who'd been his stay,</br>But ne'er beheld an agony so dread,</br>As stiff and speechless lay that widow by the dead.", "There is no hope for such &mdash; a friend, tho' dear,</br>His loss severely felt, may be replac'd;</br>Life's only joy dies not upon his bier,</br>Again is seen thy face with smilings grac'd,</br>Thy sorrows have been soften'd or effac'd;</br>But she who loses that which she did bear,</br>That one in whom all joy, all love was plac'd,</br>Alone and friendless, nourishes her care,</br>And yields her up, at length, a victim to despair.</br>"]
