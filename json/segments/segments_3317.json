["Sweet pipe!  thou choice boon of my fair,</br>Ere yet she had learnt to betray,</br>O, breathe some mellifluent air,</br>To chase the long minutes away.</br>But in vain I my woes would forget,</br>Whilst my charmer strays far from my eyes!</br>False echoes!  why mock my regret?</br>Ye zephyrs!  why slight thus my sighs?", "Ah!  rather my passion to speak,</br>A kiss to my Amoret bear!</br>O would ye but drop on her cheek</br>One pledge of my anguish &mdash; a tear!</br>Go ask, gentle messengers!  why</br>These arms the ingrate hath forsook?</br>Alas, I fortel her reply&mdash;</br>\"Poor Thyrsis has nought but his crook.\"", "Yet what though no corn-fields have I,</br>No flocks o'er the mountains that rove;</br>She will not, she cannot deny</br>Poor Thyrsis is ample in love!</br>Though sweet to the traveller's ear</br>The soft lulling murmur of rills;</br>Though wild thyme to Hybla be dear,</br>To goats the steep Appenine hills;", "Though the arbute be sweet to the bees,</br>To shepherds the wide-spreading tree,</br>Yet sweeter, far sweeter than these,</br>Are the smiles of my Charmer to me!</br>Cease, my pipe!  cease thy warbling &mdash; for hark!</br>Some footsteps approach my retreat&mdash;</br>Why, Hylax, that gratulant bark?</br>Why gambol so blithe at my feet?", "Why, lambkins!  forbear ye to feed,</br>Your heads all erect at the sound?</br>Some swain haply trips through the mead,</br>In search of a kid newly drown'd.</br>Ah, no! &mdash; behold yonder my fair!</br>To sorrow I now bid adieu&mdash;</br>Thy zephyrs have heard my fond prayer,</br>And Amoret's bosom is true!</br>"]
