["Ill-fated youth!  thy ardent soul</br>Aim'd at the heights of deathless fame,</br>Sprang from beneath the world's controul,</br>And seiz'd unknown a poet's name.</br>O that some friendly hand had deign'd to guide</br>Thy genius in its course!  and sooth'd thy erring pride.", "I mark thy muse; her gothic lyre</br>Well suits the legendary lay;</br>While darting from her eyes of sire</br>She beams a visionary day:</br>Bright as the magic torch she early gave</br>To light thy ven'trous way, through fancy's secret cave.", "There, as she taught thee to behold</br>Imagin'd deeds of distant years,</br>Embattled knights and barons bold,</br>Great Ella's griefs, or Juga's tears;</br>Rapid as thought arose the glowing scene,</br>Till poverty, despair, and death, rush'd in between.", "Poet sublime!  although no sculptur'd urn,</br>No monumental bust thy ashes grace;</br>No fair inscription teaches whom to mourn,</br>No cypress shades the consecrated place;</br>Thy name shall live on time's recording page,</br>The wonder and reproach of an enlighten'd age.</br>"]
