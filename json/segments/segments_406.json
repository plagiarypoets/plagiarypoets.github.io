["Of Things in which Mankind does most excell,</br>Nature's chief Master-piece is writing well;</br>And of all sorts of Writing none there are</br>That can the least with Poetry compare;</br>No kind of work requires so nice a touch,</br>And if well done, there's nothing shines so much;</br>But Heav'n forbid we should be so prophane,</br>To grace the vulgar with that sacred name;</br>'Tis not a Flash of Fancy which sometimes</br>Dasling our Minds, sets off the slightest Rimes,</br>Bright as a blaze, but in a moment done;</br>True Wit is everlasting, like the Sun,</br>Which though sometimes beneath a cloud retir'd,</br>Breaks out again, and is by all admir'd.</br>Number, and Rime, and that harmonious sound,</br>Which never does the Ear with harshness wound,</br>Are necessary, yet but vulgar Arts,</br>For all in vain these superficial parts</br>Contribute to the structure of the whole</br>Without a Genius too, for that's the Soul;</br>A Spirit which inspires the work throughout,</br>As that of Nature moves this World about;</br>A heat that glows in every word that's writ,</br>That's something of Divine, and more than Wit;</br>It self unseen, yet all things by it shown</br>Describing all men, but describ'd by none;</br>Where dost thou dwell?  what caverns of the Brain</br>Can such a vast and mighty thing contain?</br>When I at idle hours in vain thy absence mourn,</br>O where dost thou retire?  and why dost thou return,</br>Sometimes with powerful charms to hurry me away</br>From pleasures of the night and business of the day?</br>Ev'n now, too far transported, I am fain</br>To check thy course, and use the needfull rein;</br>As all is dullness, when the Fancy's bad,</br>So without Judgment, Fancy is but mad;</br>And Judgment has a boundless influence,</br>Not upon words alone, or only sence,</br>But on the world, of manners, and of men:</br>Fancy is but the Feather of the Pen;</br>Reason is that substantial, useful part,</br>Which gains the Head, while t' other wins the Heart.", "Here I should all the differing kinds reherse</br>Of Poetry with various sorts of Verse;</br>But who that task can after Horace do,</br>That mighty Master and Example too?</br>Ecchoes at best, all we can say is vain,</br>Dull the design, and fruitless were the pain.</br>'Tis true, the Ancients we may rob with ease,</br>But who with that sad shift himself can please,</br>Without an Actor's pride?  A Players Art</br>Is more than his who writes the borrow'd part.</br>Yet modern Laws are made for later Faults,</br>And new Absurdities inspire new thoughts;</br>What need has Satyr then to live on theft,</br>When so much fresh occasion still is left?</br>Folly abounds, nay, flourishes at Court,</br>Where on its sphere it finds a kind support;</br>But hold, White-Hall has nothing now to fear,</br>'Tis Wit and Sence that is the Subject here.</br>Defects of witty Men deserve a Cure,</br>And those who are so, will the worst endure.", "First then of Songs, that now so much abound:</br>Without his Song no Fop is to be found,</br>A most offensive Weapon which he draws</br>On all he meets, against Apollo's Laws:</br>Though nothing seems more easy, yet no part</br>Of Poetry requires a nicer Art;</br>For as in rows of richest Pearl there lyes</br>Many a blemish that escapes our Eyes,</br>The least of which Defects is plainly shewn</br>In some small Ring, and brings the value down;</br>So Songs should be to just perfection wrought;</br>Yet where can we see one without a fault,</br>Exact propriety of words and thought?</br>Th' expression easy, and the fancy high,</br>Yet that not seem to creep, nor this to fly;</br>No words transpos'd, but in such just cadence,</br>As, though hard wrought, may seem the effect of chance;</br>Here, as in all things else, is most unfit</br>Bawdry barefac'd, that poor presence to Wit;</br>Such nauseous Songs as the late Convert made,</br>Which justly call this censure on his Shade;</br>Not that warm thoughts of the transporting joy</br>Can shock the Chastest or the Nicest cloy,</br>But obscene words, too gross to move desire,</br>Like heaps of Fuel do but choak the Fire.</br>That Author's Name has undeserved praise,</br>Who pall'd the appetite he meant to raise.", "Next, Elegie, of sweet but solemn voice,</br>And of a Subject grave, exacts the choice,</br>The Praise of Beauty, Valour, Wit contains,</br>And there too oft despairing Love complains;</br>In vain, alas, for who by Wit is moved?</br>That Phoenix-she deserves to be beloved;</br>But Noisy Nonsence, and such Fops as vex</br>Mankind, take most with that fantastick Sex:</br>This to the praise of those who better knew,</br>The many raise the value of the few.</br>But here, as I too oft, alas, have tryed,</br>Women have drawn my wandering thoughts aside.</br>Their greatest fault, who in this kind have writ,</br>Is neither want of words, nor dearth of wit;</br>But though this Muse harmonious numbers yield,</br>And every Couplet be with fancy fill'd,</br>If yet a just coherence be not made</br>Between each thought, and the whole model layed</br>So right that every step may higher rise,</br>As in a Ladder, till it reach the Skies;</br>Trifles like these perhaps of late have past,</br>And may be lik'd awhile, but never last;</br>'Tis Epigram, 'tis Point, 'tis what you will,</br>But not an Elegie, nor writ with skill,</br>No Panegyrick, nor a Coopers Hill.", "A higher flight, and of a happier force,</br>Are Odes, the Muses most unruly Horse,</br>That bounds so fierce the Rider has no rest,</br>But foams at mouth, and speaks like one possest.</br>The Poet here must be indeed Inspired,</br>And not with fancy, but with fury fired.</br>Cowley might boast to have perform'd this part,</br>Had he with Nature joyn'd the rules of Art;</br>But ill expression gives too great Allay</br>To that rich Fancy which can ne're decay.</br>Though all appears in heat and fury done,</br>The Language still must soft and easy run.</br>These Laws may seem a little too severe,</br>But Judgment yields, and Fancy governs there,</br>Which, though extravagant, this Muse allows,</br>And makes the work much easier than it shews.", "Of all the ways that Wisest Men could find</br>To mend the Age, and mortify Mankind,</br>Satyr well writ has most successful prov'd,</br>And cures because the remedy is lov'd.</br>'Tis hard to write on such a Subject more,</br>Without repeating things said oft before.</br>Some vulgar Errors only Lets remove</br>That stain this Beauty, which we chiefly love.</br>Of well-chose words some take not care enough,</br>And think they may be, as the Subject, rough.</br>This great work must be more exactly made,</br>And sharpest thoughts in smoothest words convey'd:</br>Some think if sharp enough, they cannot fail,</br>As if their only business was to rail;</br>But 'tis mens Foibles nicely to unfold,</br>Which makes a Satyr different from a Scold.</br>Rage you must hide, and prejudice lay down:</br>A Satyr's Smile is sharper than his Frown.</br>So while you seem to scorn some Rival Youth,</br>Malice it self may pass sometimes for Truth.</br>The Laureat here may justly claim our praise,</br>Crown'd by Mac-Fleckno with immortal Bays;</br>Though prais'd and punish'd for another's Rimes,</br>His own deserve that glorious fate sometimes,</br>Were he not forc'd to carry now dead weight,</br>Rid by some Lumpish Minister of State.", "Here rest, my Muse, suspend thy cares awhile,</br>A greater Enterprize attends thy toil;</br>And as some Eagle that intends to fly</br>A long and tedious Journy through the Sky,</br>Considers first the perils of her case,</br>Over what Lands and Seas she is to pass,</br>Doubts her own strength so far, and justly fears</br>That lofty Road of Airy Travellers;</br>But yet incited by some great design,</br>That does her hopes beyond her fears incline,</br>Prunes every feather, views her self with care,</br>Then on a sudden flounces in the Air;</br>Away she flies so strong, so high, so fast,</br>She lessens to us, and is lost at last:</br>So greater things my Muse prepares to sing,</br>Things that will Malice, and may Envy bring;</br>Yet why should Truth offend, when only told</br>T' inform the Ignorant, and warn the Bold?</br>On then, my Muse, adventrously engage</br>To give Instructions that concern the Stage.</br>The Unities of Action, Time, and Place,</br>Which, if observed, give Plays so great a grace,</br>Are, though but little practis'd, too well known</br>To be taught here, where we pretend alone</br>From nicer faults to purge the present Age,</br>Less obvious Errors of the English Stage.", "First then, Soliloquies had need be few,</br>Extreamly short, and spoke in passion too.</br>Our Lovers talking to themselves, for want</br>Of others, make the Pit their Confidant;</br>Nor is the matter mended much, if thus</br>They trust a friend only to tell it us.</br>Th' occasion should as naturally fall,</br>As when Bellario confesses all.", "Figures of Speech, which Poets think so fine,</br>Art's needless Varnish to make Nature shine,</br>Are all but Paint upon a beauteous Face,</br>And in Descriptions only claim a place.</br>But to make Rage declame, and Grief discourse,</br>From Lovers in despair fine things to force,</br>Must needs succeed, for who can chuse but pity</br>To see poor Hero's miserably witty?</br>But O the Dialogues, where jest and mock</br>Is held up like a rest at Shittle-cock!</br>Or else like Bells eternally they Chime,</br>Men dye in Simile, and live in Rime.</br>What things are these who would be Poets thought,</br>By Nature not inspir'd, nor Learning taught?</br>Some Wit they have, and therefore may deserve</br>A better way than this by which they starve:</br>But to write Plays?  why, 'tis a bold presence</br>To Language, Breeding, Fancy, and good Sense;</br>Nay, more, for they must look within to find</br>Those secret turns of Nature in the mind;</br>Without this part in vain would be the whole,</br>And but a Body all without a Soul.</br>All this together yet is but a part</br>Of Dialogue, that great and powerful Art,</br>Now almost lost, which the old Grecians knew,</br>From whence the Romans fainter Copies drew,</br>Scarce comprehended since by but a few.</br>Plato and Lucian are the best Remains</br>Of all the wonders which this art contains;</br>Yet to our selves we Justice must allow,</br>Shakespear and Fletcher are the wonders now:</br>Consider them, and read them o're and o're,</br>Go see them play'd, then read them as before.</br>For though in many things they grosly fail,</br>Over our Passions still they so prevail,</br>That our own grief by theirs is rocks asleep,</br>The dull are forc'd to feel, the wise to weep.</br>Their Beauties Imitate, avoid their faults;</br>First on a Plot employ thy carefull thoughts,</br>Turn it with time a thousand several waies,</br>This oft alone has given success to Plays.</br>Reject that vulgar error which appears</br>So fair, of making perfect characters;</br>There's no such thing in Nature, and you'l draw</br>A faultless Monster which the world ne're saw;</br>Some faults must be, that his misfortunes drew,</br>But such as may deserve compassion too.</br>Besides the main Design, composed with Art,</br>Each moving Scene must be a Plot a part;</br>Contrive each little turn, mark every place,</br>As Painters first chalk out the future face,</br>Yet be not fondly your own slave for this,</br>But change hereafter what appears amiss.</br>Think not so much where shining thoughts to place,</br>As what a man would say in such a case.</br>Neither in Comedy will this suffice;</br>The Actor too must be before your eyes;</br>And though 'tis Drudgery to stoop so low,</br>To him you must your utmost meaning show.</br>Expose no single Fop, but lay the load</br>More equally, and spread the Folly broad;</br>The other way's too common:  oft we see</br>A fool derided by as bad as he;</br>Hawks fly at nobler game, but in his way,</br>A very Owl may prove a Bird of prey;</br>Some Poets so will one poor Fop devour;</br>But to Collect, like Bees from every flower,</br>Ingredients to compose that precious juice,</br>Which serves the world for pleasure and for use,</br>In spite of faction this will favour get,</br>But Falstaff seems unimitable yet.", "Another fault which often does befall,</br>Is when the wit of some great Poet shall</br>So overflow, that is, be none at all,</br>That all his fools speak sence, as if possest,</br>And each by Inspiration breaks his jest;</br>If once the Justness of each part be lost,</br>Well may we laugh, but at the Poets cost.</br>That silly thing men call sheer Wit avoid,</br>With which our Age so nauseously is cloy'd;</br>Humour is all, and 'tis the top of wit</br>T' express agreeably a thing that's fit.</br>But since the Poets we of late have known,</br>Shine in no dress so well as in their own,</br>The better by example to convince,</br>Lets cast a view on this wrong side of sence.", "First a Soliloquie is calmly made,</br>Where every reason is most nicely weigh'd;</br>At the end of which most opportunely comes</br>Some Hero frighted at the noise of Drums,</br>For her dear sake whom at first sight he loves,</br>And all in Metaphor his passion proves,</br>But some sad accident, that's yet unknown,</br>Parting this pair, to leave the man alone,</br>He's Jealous presently, we know not why,</br>Then, to oblige his Rival needs must dy;</br>But first he makes a Speech, wherein he tells</br>The absent Nymph how much his flame excells,</br>And yet bequeaths her generously now</br>To that dear Rival whom he does not know,</br>Who, coming in, sent sure by Fate's command,</br>Too late alas withholds his hasty hand,</br>Which now has given that most lamented stroke,</br>At which this very Stranger's heart is broke;</br>Who, more to his new friend than Mistress kind,</br>Mourns the sad Fate of being left behind,</br>Most naturally prefers those dying Charms</br>To Love and living in his Ladyes Arms.</br>How shamefull, and what monstrous things are these?</br>And then they rail at th' Age they cannot please,</br>Conclude us only partial for the dead,</br>And grudge the Sign of old Ben. Johnson's head;</br>When the Intrinsick value of the Stage</br>Can scarce be judg'd but by the following Age;</br>For Dances, Flutes, Italian Songs, and rime</br>May keep up sinking Nonsence for a time;</br>But that will fail which now so much o're rules,</br>And sence no longer will submit to fools.", "By painfull steps we are at last got up</br>Pernassus hill, upon whose Airy top</br>The Epick Poets so divinely show,</br>And with just pride behold the rest below.</br>Heroick Poems have a just presence</br>To be the chief effort of humane sence,</br>A work of such inestimable worth,</br>There are but two the world has yet brought forth,</br>Homer and Virgil:  with what awfull sound</br>Each of those names the trembling Air does wound?</br>Just as a Changeling seems below the rest</br>Of men, or rather is a two legg'd beast,</br>So those Gigantick souls, amaz'd, we find</br>As much above the rest of humane kind.</br>Nature's whole strength united; endless fame,</br>And universal shouts attend their name.</br>Read Homer once, and you can read no more,</br>For all things else will seem so dull and poor,</br>You'l wish 't unread; but oft upon him look,</br>And you will hardly need another book.</br>Had Bossu never writ, the world had still</br>Like Indians view'd this wondrous piece of Skill;</br>As something of Divine the work admired,</br>Hoped not to be Instructed, but Inspired;</br>Till he, disclosing sacred Mysteries,</br>Has shewn where all the mighty Magick lyes,</br>Describ'd the Seeds, and in what order sown,</br>That have to such a vast proportion grown.</br>Sure from some Angel he the secret knew,</br>Who through this Labyrinth has given the clue.</br>But what, alas, avails it poor Mankind</br>To see this promised Land, yet stay behind?</br>The way is shewn, but who has strength to go?</br>Who can all Sciences exactly know?</br>Whose fancy flyes beyond weak reason's sight,</br>And yet has Judgment to direct it right?</br>Whose nice distinction, Virgil-like, is such,</br>Never to say too little nor too much?</br>Let such a man begin without delay;</br>But he must do much more than I can say,</br>Must above Cowley, nay, and Milton too prevail,</br>Succeed where great Torquato, and our greater Spencer fail.</br>"]
