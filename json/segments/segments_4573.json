["Wretched the bard, who from a golden dream</br>Or splendid guineas from Sir Robert's hand</br>Awakes to penury and want, and kens aside</br>His galligaskins hang, with pocket wide,</br>Horrible gaping; he shudders as he views</br>The frightful, vacant, vast, terrific chasm,</br>\"Ill-fated, curst receptacle of coin,</br>Why wert thou made?  since thou wert made in vain;</br>Who views thy form, but thence thy master knows,</br>A modern poet, like thyself, forlorn;</br>A wretched caitiff, like thyself despis'd:</br>Why, why do dull philosophers maintain</br>That thro' all nature's works all things are filled?</br>Here, here, ye speculative drones, behold</br>A proof that all your theory is false?</br>Here is a vacuum (horrible to speak)</br>That's not unnatural, a sport of chance;</br>But almost ever empty, as 'tis now.</br>Ye gods, why struck ye not yon yawning gulf</br>Wider and wider yet; expand it far,</br>Dilated and opaque; sink, sink it deep,</br>Down to the earth's midcenter:  calm and sedate,</br>With smiles replete, I'd view th' immense profound:</br>Then like the Roman, who in antient times</br>Impetuous drove into the Earth's wide womb</br>And sought with joy a voluntary death;</br>Like him I'd plunge head-long with pleasure down</br>Into the vast abyss, and think it heaven.</br>Strange thought!  but that a heaven must prove to me,</br>Where want, where duns, where bailiffs are no more.\"</br>He said, and starting on his feet upright,</br>Impetuous rush'd athwart the flocken bed</br>Disconsolate; awhile he lay intranc'd;</br>Till the hard matted flocks awak'd the bard</br>To want, to duns, to bailiffs once again.</br>"]
