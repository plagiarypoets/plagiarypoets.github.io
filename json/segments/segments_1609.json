["IL PENSEROSO.</br>'Twas at the twilight hour,</br>Down in a darkling dell,</br>When gloomy skies did lour,</br>And scatter'd rain-drops fell,</br>Beneath an aged thorn,</br>A slow-pac'd, stealing, stream beside,</br>A maiden sat forlorn;</br>She lov'd from revelry to hide,</br>And fled the sounds of joy unholy,</br>To the arms of Melancholy.", "She sang a song of woe,</br>While sighs her bosom shook,</br>And as her tears did flow,</br>They dimpled in the brook,</br>\"O gently breathing wind,</br>Soft music only to me bear,</br>For I am not inclin'd</br>The flattering voice of joy to hear.</br>Let not mirthful noisy folly</br>Break upon my melancholy.", "\"O little fish that glide</br>The pebbled bed below;</br>Ye sportive skim the tide,</br>Alas, ye do not know</br>The cruel arts of Man,</br>His gilded bait and guileful hook,</br>Enjoy life as ye can,</br>And swim in peace the crystal brook.</br>I loathe the playful life of folly,</br>Leave me to my melancholy.", "\"O sear and yellow leaf,</br>Torn from thy parent tree,</br>Thy life, like mine, is brief,</br>To die thou teachest me.</br>O little, little wren,</br>Who courtest solitude,</br>Within the gloomy glen,</br>I like thy soft note, wild and rude,</br>Plaintive twittering 'neath the holly,</br>Oh!  it soothes my melancholy.", "L'ALLEGRO.</br>Give me mirth and give me glee,</br>Melancholy's not for me;</br>Still defer the hour of sorrow,</br>Laugh to-day and grieve tomorrow.", "If the life of man be brief,</br>Like the yearly falling leaf,</br>While the zephyrs wave the trees,</br>Let me flutter in the breeze.", "Let me, like the giddy fly,</br>Sport, nor think the tempest nigh;</br>Taste life's pleasures while I may,</br>Dancing in the noon-tide ray.", "With solitary wren,</br>Let the mourner haunt the glen;</br>Sweeter far, o'er upland park,</br>Soars on morning's wing the lark.", "What care I, tho' melancholy</br>Laugh at love, and call it folly;</br>Let me see my Lubin smile,</br>I will fear nor fraud nor guile.", "Give me mirth and give me glee,</br>Melancholy's not for me;</br>Still defer the hour of sorrow,</br>Laugh to-day and grieve to-morrow.</br>"]
