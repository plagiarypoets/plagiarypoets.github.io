["Assist my Lay, ye sacred Nine!</br>Aid me with ev'ry Thought divine,</br>To sing the Praise, and paint the Grace</br>That sparkles in the beauteous Face</br>Of dear VARIETY! &mdash; O pleasing Sound!</br>In this (and this alone) Delight is always found.", "VARIETY!  I hail thy Name:</br>Without thee what is Wealth or Fame?&mdash;</br>Thy Charms, will Damon's Pain remove,</br>And cure the desp'rate Youth of Love:</br>From Death and Bondage they can set him free,</br>And give the Swain at once both Life and Liberty.", "The greatest Pleasure Man enjoys,</br>If long continu'd, how it cloys!&mdash;</br>Behold, how fondly we pursue</br>Each gaudy Trifle that is new;</br>Whilst Things of real Worth neglected lie:</br>This plainly shews thy Force, O dear VARIETY!", "How dull, insipid, wou'd appear</br>The Hours of each revolving Year,</br>Depriv'd of thy enliv'ning Aid!</br>Ev'n Sol's bright Rays wou'd seem to fade:</br>But kind indulgence Heav'n bestow'd on thee</br>Invigorating Lustre, &mdash; dear VARIETY!", "No pen can paint, or Tongue express</br>Thy boundless Charms:  All, all confess</br>Thy Pow'r. &mdash; O then let Reason guide,</br>Ye headstrong Youths, and Vice deride;</br>Its Paths you've follow'd long; now vertuous be,</br>And thus you'll taste the Sweets of dear VARIETY.</br>"]
