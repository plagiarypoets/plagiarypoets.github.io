["Come virgins, who dwell on the plain,</br>And weep with a shepherd sincere;</br>Come listen, and learn from my strain,</br>Since Hebe no longer is here;</br>For she was so modest and meek,</br>What mildness with her could compare?</br>But, oh!  my muse scarcely can speak</br>The beauties that bloom'd in the fair!", "Her mind was a stranger to strife,</br>Contentment she valu'd to free;</br>Religion she lov'd as her life,</br>For none were more pious than she:</br>Her Maker she e'er made her theme,</br>His goodness was glad to rehearse;</br>And oft by some sweet winding stream,</br>She echo'd his praises in verse.", "But, ah!  the dear damsel is gone!</br>Her songs of devotion are o'er!</br>And the nymphs and the swains are forlorn,</br>Since Hebe their pride is no more:</br>For, oh!  she e'er taught them the way</br>To virtue, to honour, and truth;</br>And while they were sportive and gay</br>She bade them reflect in their youth.", "'Till death with his scythe came along,</br>And blighted her blossoms so soon;</br>He cut her off short from the throng,</br>When first with the maid it was noon.</br>Yet calmly her breath she resign'd,</br>For no one e'er saw her distrest;</br>And while on her arm she reclin'd,</br>She gently sunk into her rest!", "Then virgins who frolick and play,</br>Regardless of sorrow and care,</br>Come round and attend to the lay,</br>And weep for the loss of the fair!</br>Like her, oh!  pursue the right way,</br>Like her be religious and staid:</br>Ah!  cease ye gay nymphs for to stray,</br>And copy the mild matchless maid.</br>"]
