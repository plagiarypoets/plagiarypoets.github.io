["Banish'd Parnassus and the neighb'ring plain,</br>Thus did the Muses to their God complain:</br>\"A race unpolish'd hath our seats possess'd,</br>And Greece, for arts renown'd, with force oppress'd.</br>Inur'd to spoil, they scorn the tuneful lyre,</br>Our sacred numbers, and our heav'nly fire.</br>No more Anacreon's flowing numbers move,</br>Nor tender Sappho soothes the soul to love;</br>Homer neglected lies, and Pindar's flame</br>No hero warms, near fair Hinenus' stream.</br>Hear then, thou beamy pow'r, bright god of day!</br>Since ev'ry land lies open to the ray,</br>Some soft retreat, some silent mansion chuse,</br>And there from rage protect the injur'd Muse.\"</br>The God assents, and in a western isle,</br>A winding vale, with skill divine, he forms,</br>Secure from summer's heat, and winter's storms:</br>On either side he rears a lofty mound,</br>In whose deep bosom lies the Glin profound.</br>The rocks and woods adorn it's bending sides,</br>And here a fallling stream soft murm'ring glides:</br>Above the rest two rocks of monstrous size,</br>With their aspiring foreheads reach the skies;</br>The one, a naked heap, vast, craggy, high,</br>With pleasing horror fills the wond'ring eye;</br>The other, crown'd with wood, her front erects</br>Above the vale, and a cool shade projects.</br>Upon the naked cliff, the birds of Jove</br>Bring forth the pledges of their fruitful love;</br>Here teach their young a bolder flight to dare,</br>And bear the forky thunder thro' the air.</br>Between these rocks, the bale obliquely bends</br>His curse, and is a huge high quarry ends:</br>Down this vast steep a fountain gently slides,</br>Or, swell'd with rain, rolls on his foamy tides;</br>Then thro' the vale in wild meanders flows,</br>Here hides his limpid waves, there kindly shows.</br>Oft have Diana and her virgin train,</br>Tir'd with the pleasures of the open plain,</br>In this recess their wearied limbs repos'd,</br>And to soft winds their softer parts expos'd:</br>Here, oft her train have round their Goddess stood</br>While naked, she enjoy'd the silver flood:</br>The Paphian Queen, and all her winged Loves,</br>For this, have quit their high Idalian groves,</br>Here, with the Muses pass'd their flowing hours</br>Near the cools stream, or in the shady bow'rs;</br>While all the Nine their golden harps have strung,</br>And Waller's verse on Sacharissa sung.</br>Thus did Apollo for his choir prepare</br>A seat, remov'd from noise, and anxious care,</br>For which the Muse in gratitude has brought</br>Into that isle the Greek and Roman thought;</br>There, to her Spencer, gave the sounding string,</br>And first taught Swift, and Denham, how to sing.</br>"]
