["Yet two short days, my CATHERINE! &mdash; then no more</br>Beneath our long-lov'd SPIRES, thy graceful Form</br>Shall lightly glide, to cheer my languid hour</br>With emanations sparkling, soft and warm,</br>Shed from the MIND'S rich stores; and with the charm</br>Of language accurate, by habit taught</br>Th' ideal Train with happiest powers to arm,</br>That rise in swift subservience to each thought,</br>Whether with Reason's strength, or Fancy's radiance fraught.", "Now damp November's desolating gale</br>Covers the brooks with shrunk and yellow leaves:</br>His iron skies scowl on our darling Vale,</br>Nor aught from sway more stern the Scene reprieves.</br>Of thee since Destiny my heart bereaves,</br>Lone wintry sighs in unison ascend</br>With the chill blast which faded Nature grieves!&mdash;</br>On me her griefs, but not her hopes attend;</br>SPRING shall return to her, when distant far my Friend!", "No Expectation tells, with voice benign,</br>That future years shall give her back to me,&mdash;</br>Thou may'st again behold these Turrets shine,</br>These bowers may spread, these meadows bloom for thee,</br>But here no more wilt thou thine ANNA see,</br>Yet not for that shroud those mild eyes in gloom,</br>She twines the cypress wreath, by Heav'n's decree,</br>For many a Victim of the ruthless Tomb!&mdash;</br>Set are her heart-dear Orbs where no blest mornings come!", "For thee, loved MAID, extracted be each thorn</br>That lurks amid the roses of thy fate!</br>Knowledge and Taste are thine, and bid thee scorn</br>Each shaft of ENVY, FALSEHOOD, PRIDE, and HATE,</br>For thou hast soar'd where they have never sat;</br>Trac'd GENIUS in his sun-track; with rapt gaze,</br>Ador'd bright Nature in her scenic state,</br>And in thy morn of life and riper day,</br>Fed thy clear lamp of Faith from TRUTH'S unclouded ray!</br>"]
