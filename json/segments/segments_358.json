["The Theme in other Works for every Part,</br>Supplies Materials to the Builder's Art:</br>To build from Matter is sublimely great,</br>But Gods and Poets only can create;</br>And such are you;  Their Privilege you claim</br>To show your Wonders, but conceal your Name.", "Like some establish'd King, without controul,</br>You take a general Progress thro' the Soul;</br>Survey each Part, examine every Side,</br>Where she's secure, and where unfortify'd.</br>In faithful Lines her History declare,</br>And trace the Causes of her Civil War;</br>Your Pen no partial Prejudices sway,</br>But Truth decides, and Virtue wins the Day.", "Thro' what gay Fields and flow'ry Scenes we pass,</br>Where Fancy sports, and Fiction leads the Chace?</br>Where Life, as thro' her various Acts she tends,</br>Like other Comedies in Marriage ends.", "What Muse but yours so justly could display</br>Th' embattled Passions marshal'd in array?</br>Bid the rang'd Appetites in Order move,</br>Give Lust a Figure, and a Shape to Love?</br>To airy Notions solid Forms dispense,</br>And make our Thoughts the Images of Sense?</br>Discover all the Rational Machine,</br>And show the Movements, Springs, and Wheels within?", "But Hymen waves his Torch, all Discords cease;</br>All parly, drop their Arms, and sue for Peace.</br>Soon as the Signal flames, they quit the Fight,</br>For All at first but differ'd to unite.</br>From every Part the Lines in Order move,</br>And sweetly center in the Point of Love.", "Let Blockheads to the musty Schools repair,</br>And poach for Morals and the Passions there,</br>Where Virtue, like a Dwarf in Giant's Arms,</br>Cumber'd with Words, and manacled in Terms,</br>Serves to amuse the Philosophick Fool,</br>By Method dry, and Regularly Dull.</br>Who sees thy Lines so visibly express</br>The Soul herself in such a pleasing Dress;</br>May from thy Labours be convinc'd and taught,</br>How Spenser would have Sung, and Plato Thought.</br>"]
