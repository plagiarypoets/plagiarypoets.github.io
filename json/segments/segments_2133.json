["Gem of my soul!  my thoughts are still with thee</br>Where'er my steps may wander, &mdash; near or far</br>O'er the blue mountains, or the trackless sea;</br>'Mid life's high revelry, 'mid this world's war,</br>Thou art the light &mdash; the solitary star</br>That gleams in beauty spiritually bright,</br>Shielding a ray divine 'mid things that mar</br>The harmony of life, till to my sight</br>Thou seem'st the soul of day, the spirit of the night!", "Gem of my soul!  the ocean's pearl, though pure,</br>Sinks into dimness on that neck of snow!</br>And I've beheld that spotless brow obscure</br>The brightest jewels that earth's mines can show;</br>And when thy soul, deep in those eyes, would glow</br>With glowing thought &mdash; with eloquence &mdash; with love!</br>They more than match'd the fairest things below,</br>And even outshone the brightest things above,</br>Mingling in one wild glance the eagle and the dove!", "Gem of my soul!  be ever what thou'rt now,</br>By genius polish'd, and by nature fair!</br>Were aught like thee accorded to my brow,</br>'Twould never be again the seat of care,</br>But heaven and love would rest for ever there!</br>Light would illume my path, and the lone hour</br>Would never more be mine, my life t' impair;&mdash;</br>The darkest clime on earth would be a bower</br>Of heavenly bliss, with thee its light &mdash; its love &mdash; its flower!</br>"]
