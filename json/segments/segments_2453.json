["We parted:  Oh!  it was a painful hour!</br>Not that I thought him lost to me for ever,</br>I knew that mighty LOVE'S resistless power</br>Would re-unite us, ne'er again to sever;</br>For WE are wedded &mdash; not as thoughtless mortals,</br>Incited only by terrestrial views,</br>Enter that sacred fane's mysterious portals.</br>Our souls are wedded; that assurance strews</br>My widow'd path with flowers of fadeless hues.", "Yet is the briefest parting hard, for LOVE,</br>Deprived of WISDOM, is a rayless sun;</br>A summer midnight, when no star above</br>Throws down one cheering ray; 'tis GOOD, alone,</br>Without her partner TRUTH; or it resembles</br>Warm, melting CHARITY, intent to bless,</br>When, without FAITH to guide her steps, she trembles</br>O'er the dark scene of human wretchedness,</br>Wondering if Heaven permits or will distress.", "'Twas hard to part; and while his spirit hovered</br>On the cold lips my kisses could not warm,</br>I prayed and murmur'd; but, alas!  when covered</br>By the dark pall, they bore that manly form</br>To its cold grave, I lost the pang of sorrow,</br>For reason fled, and I'd a dreamless sleep;</br>But woke, in anguish, on the coming morrow,</br>No more to murmur, pray, or even weep,</br>For grief is ever silent when it's deep.", "Humbled to earth, my self-upbraiding soul,</br>With mental tongue, exclaim'd, Thy will be done!</br>When, through my bosom, such a feeling stole,</br>As mocks the power of language; it was one</br>Of those delicious thrills of nameless rapture</br>We feel, when conscience, Heaven, and friends approve;</br>When earthly joys have lost power to capture&mdash;</br>For REUBEN'S spirit whispered, \"Peace, sweet dove,</br>We're joined, for ever, in Conjugal Love.\"</br>"]
