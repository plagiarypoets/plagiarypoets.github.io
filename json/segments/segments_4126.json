["Ye grassy seats!  ye hawthorn bowers!</br>That crown the wat'ry glade;</br>Where Commerce oft her bounty pours,</br>By MILL'S verdant shade:</br>Shorn are your fragrant honours now,</br>Your turfy hillocks all laid low,</br>Scar'd is the linnet from the spray,</br>Silent the thrush and blackbird's song,</br>Where rolls the rapid TEES along</br>His wildly devious way.", "Ah!  pleasing mounds &mdash; regretted shades!</br>Ah!  flow'rs belov'd in vain!</br>No matrons grave, no blooming maids</br>Shall lead their infant train</br>To feel the gales that o'er ye blow</br>A cheering influence bestow,</br>Chill'd is their gladsome wing;</br>No more the aged shall they sooth,</br>Nor minister to drooping youth</br>A foretaste of the spring.", "Say, Father Tees, for thou hast seen,</br>Say, was it ruthless taste</br>Or av'rice from thy margent green</br>The sylvan beauties chac'd?</br>The furious north-wind now shall cleave</br>With icy arm thy glassy wave,</br>Thy captive streams shall thrall;</br>No more his mates the school-boy leads,</br>To gambol 'midst thy whisp'ring reeds,</br>Or on thine echoes call.", "To each his suff'rings; why complain,</br>Or these lov'd scenes bemoan?</br>A lot awaits the flow'ry train</br>Congenial to my own;</br>Let not this truth one sigh create,</br>Sweet hope attends on ev'ry state,</br>'Tho' happiness too swiftly flies;</br>May the resemblance teach me this,</br>Justly t' appreciate earthly bliss</br>And evanescent joys.</br>"]
