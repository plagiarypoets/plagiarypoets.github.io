["Descend from Heaven!  propitious Queen,</br>First-born, and best belov'd of Jove;</br>Whilst meek-ey'd Patience, Joy serene,</br>And tow'ring Hope &mdash; around thee move&mdash;</br>Descend! &mdash; at thy refulgent sight,</br>A tribe of woes compell'd to flight,</br>Submissive own thy potent sway,</br>Like airy clouds disperse, and leave a golden day.", "Come, with rosy garlands crown'd,</br>And every golden flow'r that blows;</br>Scatter ambrosial odours round,</br>And all thy thousand sweets disclose.</br>With thee to dwell the tuneful Nine</br>Delight, and hail thy pow'r divine;</br>Their notes now more melodious rise,</br>Now the full concert swells, and clears the shining skies.", "Hence, ye delights of sordid minds&mdash;</br>Begone the world's fantastic pride;&mdash;</br>Though solemn Queen of sober smiles,</br>Alone can'st bid each care subside;</br>And not of long descent or pow'r</br>Avail to win thy peaceful hour,</br>Thou spurn'st such visionary things,</br>The glitt'ring pomp of wealth, and purple pride of Kings.", "No &mdash; thou secluded lov'st to dwell,</br>Far from the idly busy scene,</br>Where, in the hollow, moss-grown cell,</br>The solitary sage is seen.</br>Now!  now with thee I seem to rove,</br>The gloomy glade, the waving grove,</br>Now climb the mountain's rugged brow,</br>Now tread the flow'ry vale that winds along below.", "But ah!  the flatt'ring, dear deceit</br>Which fancy form'd, dissolves away!&mdash;</br>And who shall shew thy sacred seat,</br>Or lead me through the doubtful way?</br>'Tis done!  an heav'nly guide descends&mdash;</br>Hither beneficent she bends&mdash;</br>'Tis Reason's self, divinely fair,</br>Who points to Virtue's fane, and bids me find thee there.</br>"]
