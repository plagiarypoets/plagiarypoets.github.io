["Faunus, who lov'st to chase the light-foot Nymphs,</br>Propitious guard my fields and sunny farm,</br>And nurse with kindly care</br>The promise of my flock.", "So to thy pow'r a Kid shall yearly bleed,</br>And the full bowl to genial VENUS flow;</br>And on thy rustic shrine</br>Rich odours incense breathe:", "So thro' the vale the wanton herds shall bound,</br>When thy December comes, and on the green</br>The steer in traces loose</br>With the free village sport:", "No more the lamb shall fly th' insidious wolf,</br>The woods shall shed their leaves, and the glad hind</br>The ground, where once he dug,</br>Shall beat in sprightly dance.</br>"]
