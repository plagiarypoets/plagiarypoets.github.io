["And must Thou sink beneath the storms of Fate,</br>Ah, gentle heart!  so tender and so true!</br>Who loved me in a world of pain and hate,</br>And \"did for me what none beside would do;\"</br>And though thy sorrows wore as dark a hue,</br>Met me with smiles &mdash; who could no smiles repay,</br>And to my cold embrace with rapture flew,</br>Content, if thou couldst charm some cares away,</br>As on that faithful breast tranquil awhile I lay.", "Yes!  the world's hardened virtues may look down</br>On faults like thine with unforgiving eye;</br>Some saintly Hypocrite austerely frown,</br>Whose creed affords no place for Charity;</br>Some scornful sister sweep indignant by,</br>In self-applause of her own bloodless heart,</br>Which shuts from Love what thou couldst not deny;&mdash;</br>Such may look on thee suffering, and depart</br>Haply, \"to thank their God they are not as thou art.\"", "But in that page where kindness is recorded,</br>Shall thy name stand in lines of living light;</br>And in that hour when goodness is rewarded,</br>Thou shalt find favour in that Being's sigh</br>Who will thy pilgrimage on earth requite</br>With joys immortal, and among the blest</br>Place thee in bowers of Eden, pure and bright.&mdash;</br>If these be dreams, at least there is one breast</br>Where, though all fade beside, thy memory still shall rest.</br>"]
