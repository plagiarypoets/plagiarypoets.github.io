["What Shepherd or Nymph of the Grove</br>Can blame me for dropping a tear?</br>Since she whom alone I can love,</br>My Sophia, my fav'rite's not here.</br>Alas!  since she quitted the plain,</br>No Swain's so dejected as I;</br>Will she absent forever remain?</br>Shall I live but to sorrow and sigh?", "How pleasing and sweet was her song!</br>(On her praise I forever could dwell)</br>Not one could be found in the throng</br>Who in aught could Sophia excell.</br>And tender and kind was her heart;</br>Soft pity repos'd in her breast;</br>The birds from their young she'd ne'er part,</br>Nor ever would rifle their nest.", "And sure she some pity will feel</br>For a Swain that is constant and true</br>(Her emotions she could not conceal</br>When I tenderly bade her adieu):</br>She'll think of the grief and concern</br>That plainly appear'd in my eyes</br>When I anxiously prest her return;</br>She mark'd both my looks and my sighs.", "Then I will not indulge to despair,</br>Nor doubt of her fondness for me,</br>But strive to forget all my care,</br>And hope my dear Charmer to see.</br>I'd press her quite close to my heart,</br>With rapture, with joy, and delight;</br>No more shall my Fair-one depart,</br>I'll never be depriv'd of her sight.</br>"]
