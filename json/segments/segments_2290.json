["Dread Offspring of Tartarian birth,</br>Whose nodding crest is stained with gore,</br>Whom to some giant-son of Earth,</br>Strife, in strong pangs of childbed, bore;</br>O War!  fierce monster, homicide,</br>Who marchest on with hideous stride,</br>Shaking thy spear distilling blood:</br>Bellona thee, in angry mood,</br>Taught proud Ambition's spoils to win,</br>Amidst the loud, conflicting din</br>Of arms, where Discord's gorgon-featured form</br>High shakes her flaming torch amidst the martial storm.", "Stern God!  wolf-hearted, and accursed,</br>Fostered by Power, by Rapine nursed,</br>Oppression ever in thy train,</br>For hapless man prepares her chain:</br>A thousand vulture-forms beside</br>Stalk on before thee; bloated Pride</br>Thick-eyed Revenge, his soul on fire,</br>And Slaughter breathing threatenings dire,</br>Tumult, and Rage, and Fury fell,</br>And Cruelty, the imp of hell,</br>Her heart of adamant!  and armed her hand</br>With iron hooks, and cords, and Desolation's brand.", "There, where the Battle loudest roars,</br>Where wide the impurpled deluge pours,</br>And ghastly Death, his thousands slain,</br>Whirls his swift chariot o'er the plain,</br>Rapt in horror's frantic fit,</br>'Midst the dire scene thou lov'st to sit,</br>To catch some wretch's parting sigh,</br>To mark the dimly-glazing eye,</br>The face into contortions thrown,</br>Convulsed:  the deep, deep-lengthening groan,</br>The frequent sob, the agonizing smart,</br>And nature's dread release, the pang that rends the heart.", "Avaunt, from Albion's isle!  nor there</br>Thy arms, and maddening car prepare,</br>Nor bid thy crimson banners fly</br>Terrific, through the troubled sky;</br>But stay thee in thy wild career;</br>Lay by thy glittering shield and spear,</br>Thy polished casque, and nodding crest,</br>And let thy sable steeds have rest:</br>At length, the work of slaughter close,</br>And give to Europe's sons repose,</br>Bid the hoarse clangors of the trumpet cease,</br>And smooth thy wrinkled front to meet the smiles of Peace.</br>"]
