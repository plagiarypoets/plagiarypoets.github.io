["Napolean died upon Helena's rock,</br>Round and beneath were pil'd and stor'd the waves,</br>Mighty and fathomless.  Atlantic's shock</br>Recoil'd, and through its deepest coldest caves,</br>Of pillar'd spar and coral architraves,</br>Did ocean's homage to that strange man's death.</br>Bad was he, but yet great.  Of kings, of slaves,</br>Of Popes, the equal dread.  His latest breath</br>Fell where the waters wash'd to shore his sea-green wreath.", "But thou, by Asian Azoff's shallow pool,</br>Where the Don pours its tributary mud,</br>Where nought but cold Cimmerian blasts have rule,</br>And Kalmuck's hungry Tartars fight for food;</br>Thou, whom we once thought wise, and great, and good&mdash;</br>Peace, such as thou did'st wish to all, abide</br>With thee &mdash; a despot's peace.  So let the flood</br>Of mem'ry stagnate round thee, like the tide</br>That washes Taganrok from Azof's shallowest side.", "Then let the Cossack trail his barb'rous lance,</br>And learn to do the obsequies of Czars;</br>Teach his wild horse around thy grave to prance,</br>And know the sounds of amens from hurras.</br>He, paid in plunder for his wounds and scars,</br>Rejoices that another chance may come,</br>When southward, in the strife of Turkish wars,</br>That horse shall bear Tambourgi's muffled drum,</br>And trample, not as now, on many a lordly tomb.", "&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;", "Fair liberty!  Nor he of Helen's Isle,</br>Nor he of Azof's side, were born of thee,</br>Children of cruelty, long nurs'd by guile,</br>They claim no tear of tribute from the free.</br>Then let the despots rest.  But where is he</br>Who, pure in life, majestic in his fall,</br>Lay down beneath his native cedar-tree?</br>Potomack's wave, Mount Vernon's grassy pall,</br>That wraps his relics round, O!  these are worth them all.</br>"]
