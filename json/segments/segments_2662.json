["Coy Spirit of the cave!  Sweet Echo, hail!</br>Responsive to the softly sighing breeze,</br>As on thy gentle ear</br>Its mournful murmurs swell.", "Thee oft, perhaps, some lonely virgin haunts</br>To tell her cherish'd grief, her slighted vows;</br>Or, chaunt her vesper hymn</br>Along these twilight groves.", "Sequestered LEISURE, fondly here retreats</br>From toiling Care, and Folly's idling train;</br>Retreats with chasten'd TASTE,</br>And lovely SCIENCE join'd:", "Here sits, and muses, while young Morning dawns</br>With faintly gleaming lustre; and the skies</br>With mild and genial breath,</br>Diffuse refreshment round;", "While woods hoarse-rustle to the the sighing gales;</br>And, warbling in the dewy shades, the birds</br>With prompted joy, salute</br>The kindling Day's return.", "Lingering, he loves to catch thy accents clear</br>As Eve looks pensive thro' the fading clouds</br>Or, o'er the glimmering scene</br>Her dusky shadows draws.", "Then, distant bleatings from the fragrant fold,</br>Or, sacred chimes from tree-embosom'd tower,</br>His soften'd soul inspire</br>With saintly, calm delight.</br>"]
