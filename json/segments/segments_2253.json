["And heartless, oft, like moody madness, stare</br>To see the phantom train their secret work prepare.", "For oft, when Eve hath spread her dusky veil,</br>And hid each star that wont to cheer the night,</br>In some deep gleen remote from human sight,</br>The griesly wizard his associates hail.</br>There, at the thrilling verse, and charmed spell,</br>Fantastic shapes and direful shadows throng;</br>Night's sober ear piercing with hideous yell,</br>While in the goblin round they troop along.</br>Thence each betakes him to his several toil;</br>To dive, to fly, to ride the wintry blast,</br>To dig the mine, to cleave the church-yard soil,</br>Or rake the bottom of the watry wast.</br>Each powerful drug, with more than mortal skill,</br>Where e'er bestow'd, or hid from searching eye,</br>Selecting heedful of their tasker's will:</br>Nor cease their labours till the dawn descry,</br>Their hated impious work, and reddens all the sky.", "Nor wilt thou leave for other bards to sing,</br>The ruthless spirit of the angry flood;</br>How, at grey Eve, in fell and crafty mood,</br>O'er fen and lake he shakes his foggy wing:</br>Or when the Curfew with his sullen note,</br>Unchains, to roam the earth, each Elfin sprite,</br>Like some drear lamp, from out the quaggy moat,</br>The fiend shines forth, to lure th' incautious wight.</br>What though, far off, from some dark dell espied</br>His glikmm'ring mazes cheer th' excursive sight,</br>Yet turn, ye wand'rer. . .</br>"]
