["Sleep, lovely babe!  I love to see thee sleep</br>In infant innocence serenely there;</br>No sins of thine have made thy soft eye weep,</br>And thou art pure as angel seraphs are:</br>But soon, oh!  soon, in sorrow's thorny way</br>Shall thy young heart and tender footsteps stray.", "Sleep, lovely babe!  blest stranger to our sphere,</br>May no rude hand e'er break thy peaceful rest:</br>And may that sun, which smiles upon thee here,</br>In life's last moments be to thee more blest,</br>Since life, and youth, and pleasure's airy dream</br>Are but the shadow of the morning beam.", "Sleep, lovely babe!  for soon thy heart shall know</br>The joyless hours which other days will bring,</br>When thy bright morning hides its hallow'd glow,</br>And life's cold winter wastes the sweets of spring:</br>Then dreaming on, thy cradled songs no more</br>Shall soothe thy aching heart, as once in days of yore.", "Sleep, tender babe!  while on thy lovely face</br>A mother's watchful eye delights to dwell,</br>And there thy smiling innocence to trace</br>While the young heart oft heaves with many a swell;</br>Sleep, tender babe!  nor startle from that sleep,</br>For thy fond mother wakes with thee to smile or weep.", "Sleep, tender babe!  if after years are thine,</br>And thou shouldst look on misery, like me,</br>Which tells thee what thou wert &mdash; but ne'er canst be;</br>And trace with fancy's aid th' unbroken line,</br>Then will the tear, as on thy pillow shed,</br>Awake the dream of life, a dream forever fled.</br>"]
