["Hark, hark, 'tis a voice from the tomb,</br>Come Lucy, it cries, come away,</br>The grave of thy Collin has room</br>To rest thee beside his cold clay.</br>I come, my dear shepherd, I come,</br>Ye friends and companions adieu,</br>I haste to my Colin's dark home,</br>To die on his bosom so true.", "All mournful the midnight bell rung,</br>When Lucy, sad Lucy, arose;</br>And forth to the green turf she sprung,</br>Where Colin's pale ashes repose.</br>All wet with the night's chilling dew,</br>Her bosom embrac'd the cold ground,</br>While stormy winds over her blew,</br>And night-ravens croak'd all around.", "How long, my lov'd Collin, she cry'd,</br>How long must thy Lucy complain?</br>How long shall the grave my love hide?</br>How long ere it join us again?</br>For thee thy fond shepherdess liv'd,</br>With thee o'er the world would she fly;</br>For thee has she sorrow'd and griev'd;</br>For thee wou'd she lie down and die.", "Alas!  what avails it how dear</br>Thy Lucy was once to her swain?</br>Her face like the lilly so fair,</br>And eyes that gave light to the plain.</br>The shepherd that lov'd her is gone;</br>That face and those eyes charm no more;</br>And Lucy forgot, and alone,</br>To death shall her Collin deplore.", "While thus she lay sunk in despair,</br>And mourn'd to the echoes around,</br>Inflam'd all at once grew the air,</br>And thunder shook dreadful the ground.</br>I hear the kind call, and obey,</br>Oh, Collin receive me, she cried,</br>Then breathing a groan o'er his clay,</br>She hung on his tomb-stone and died.</br>"]
