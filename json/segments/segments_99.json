["Rapt with the Rage of mine own ravisht Thought,</br>Through Contemplation of those goodly Sights,</br>And glorious Images in Heaven wrought,</br>Whose wondrous Beauty breathing sweet Delight,</br>Do kindle Love in high conceited Sprights:</br>I fain to tell the things that I behold,</br>But feel my Wits to fail, and Tongue to fold.", "Vouchsafe then, O thou most Almighty Spright,</br>From whom all Gifts of Wit and Knowledg flow,</br>To shed into my Breast some sparkling Light</br>Of thine eternal Truth; that I may show</br>Some little Beams to mortal Eyes below</br>Of that immortal Beauty, there with Thee,</br>Which in my weak distraughted Mind I see.", "That with the Glory of so goodly Sight,</br>The Hearts of Men, which fondly here admire</br>Fair-seeming Shews, and feed on vain Delight,</br>Transported with celestial Desire</br>Of those fair Forms, may lift themselves up higher,</br>And learn to love with zealous humble Duty,</br>Th' eternal Fountain of that heavenly Beauty.", "Beginning then below, with th' easie View</br>Of this base World, subject to fleshly Eye,</br>From thence to mount aloft by order due,</br>To Contemplation of th' immortal Skye:</br>Of the soar Faulcon so I learn to flye,</br>That flags a while her fluttering Wings beneath,</br>Till she herself for stronger Flight can breathe.", "Then look who list, thy gazeful Eyes to feed</br>With sight of that is fair, look on the Frame</br>Of this wide Universe, and therein reed</br>The endless kinds of Creatures, which by name</br>Thou canst not count, much less their Natures aim:</br>All which are made with wondrous wise respect,</br>And all with admirable Beauty deckt.", "First th' earth, on Adamantine Pillers founded,</br>Amid the Sea, engirt with brasen Bands;</br>Then th' Air still flitting, but yet firmly bounded</br>On every side, with Piles of flaming Brands,</br>Never consum'd, nor quencht with mortal hands;</br>And last, that mighty shining crystal Wall,</br>Wherewith he hath encompassed this All.", "By view whereof, it plainly may appear,</br>That still as every thing doth upward tend,</br>And further is from Earth, so still more clear</br>And fair it grows, till to his perfect end</br>Of purest Beauty, it at last ascend:</br>Ayr more than Water, Fire much more than Ayr,</br>And Heaven than Fire appears more pure and fair.", "Look thou no further, but affix thine Eye</br>On that bright shiny round still-moving Mass,</br>The House of blessed Gods, which Men call Skye,</br>All sow'd with glistring Stars more thick than Grass,</br>Whereof each other doth in Brightness pass;</br>But those two most, which ruling Night and Day,</br>As King and Queen, the Heaven's Empire sway.", "And tell me then, what hast thou ever seen,</br>That to their Beauty may compared be,</br>Or can the sight that is most sharp and keen</br>Endure their Captain's flaming Head to see?</br>How much less those, much higher in Degree,</br>And so much fairer, and much more than these,</br>As these are fairer than the Land and Seas?", "For, far above these Heavens which here we see,</br>Be others, far exceeding these in Light,</br>Not bounded, not corrupt, as these same be,</br>But infinite in Largeness and in Height,</br>Unmoving, uncorrupt, and spotless bright;</br>That need no Sun t' illuminate their spheres,</br>But their own native Light, far passing theirs.", "And as these Heavens still by degrees arise,</br>Until they come to their first Mover's Bound,</br>That in his mighty Compass doth comprise,</br>And carry all the rest with him around;</br>So those likewise do by degrees redound,</br>And rise more fair, till they at last arrive</br>To the most fair, whereto they all do strive.", "Fair is the Heaven, where happy Souls have place,</br>In full enjoyment of Felicity,</br>Whence they do still behold the glorious Face</br>Of the divine eternal Majesty:</br>More fair is that, where those Idees on hie</br>Enranged be, which Plato so admired,</br>And pure Intelligences from God inspired.", "Yet fairer is that Heaven, in which do reign</br>The sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates,</br>Which in their high Protections do contain</br>All mortal Princes, and imperial States;</br>And fairer yet, whereas the royal Seats</br>And heavenly Dominations are set,</br>From whom all earthly Governance is set.", "Yet far more fair be those bright Cherumbins,</br>Which all with golden Wings are over-dight,</br>And those eternal burning Seraphims,</br>Which from their Faces dart out fiery Light;</br>Yet fairer than they both, and much more bright</br>Be th' Angels and Archangels, which attend</br>On God's own Person, without rest or end.", "These thus in fair each other far excelling,</br>As to the highest they approach more near,</br>Yet is that highest far beyond all telling,</br>Fairer than all the rest which there appear,</br>Though all their Beauties joyn'd together were:</br>How then can mortal Tongue hope to express</br>The Image of such endless Perfectness?", "Cease then my Tongue, and lend unto my Mind</br>Leave to bethink how great that Beauty is,</br>Whose utmost Parts so beautiful I find:</br>How much more those essential Parts of his,</br>His Truth, his Love, his Wisdom, and his Bliss,</br>His Grace, his Doom, his Mercy and his Might,</br>By which he lends us of himself a sight!", "Those unto all he daily doth display,</br>And shew himself in th' Image of his Grace,</br>As in a Looking-glass, through which he may</br>Be seen of all his Creatures vile and base,</br>That are unable else to see his Face,</br>His glorious Face which glistereth else so bright,</br>That th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight.", "But we frail Wights, whose Sight cannot sustain</br>The Sun-bright Beams, when he on us doth shine,</br>But that their Points rebutted back again</br>Are dull'd, how can we see with feeble Eyne</br>The Glory of that Majesty Divine;</br>In sight of whom both Sun and Moon are dark,</br>Compared to his least resplendent Spark?", "The means therefore which unto us is lent</br>Him to behold, is on his Work to look,</br>Which he hath made in Beauty excellent,</br>And in the same, as in a brasen Book,</br>To read enregistred in every nook</br>His Goodness, which his Beauty doth declare:</br>For all that's good, is beautiful and fair.", "Thence gathering Plumes of perfect Speculation,</br>To imp the Wings of thy high-flying Mind,</br>Mount up aloft through heavenly Contemplation,</br>From this dark World, whose Damps the Soul do blind;</br>And like the native Brood of Eagles kind,</br>On that bright Sun of Glory fix thine Eyes,</br>Clear'd from gross Mists of frail Infirmities.", "Humbled with Fear and awful Reverence,</br>Before the Footstool of his Majesty</br>Throw thy self down with trembling Innocence,</br>Ne dare look up with corruptible Eye,</br>On the drad Face of that great Deity,</br>For fear, lest if he chance to look on thee,</br>Thou turn to nought, and quite confounded be.", "But lowly fall before his Mercy-Seat,</br>Close cover'd with the Lamb's Integrity,</br>From the just Wrath of his avengeful Threat,</br>That sits upon the righteous Throne on high:</br>His Throne is built upon Eternity,</br>More firm and durable than Steel or Brass,</br>Or the hard Diamond, which them both doth pass.", "His Scepter is the Rod of Righteousness,</br>With which he bruseth all his Foes to dust,</br>And the great Dragon strongly doth repress,</br>Under the rigour of his Judgment just:</br>His Seat is Truth, to which the Faithful trust;</br>From whence proceed her Beams so pure and bright,</br>That all about him sheddeth glorious Light.", "Light far exceeding that bright blazing Spark,</br>Which darted is from Titan's flaming Head,</br>That with his Beams enlumineth the dark</br>And dampish Air, whereby all things are red:</br>Whose Nature yet so much is marvelled</br>Of mortal Wits, that it doth much amaze</br>The greatest Wisards, which thereon do gaze.", "But that immortal Light which there doth shine,</br>Is many thousand times more bright, more clear,</br>More excellent, more glorious, more divine,</br>Through which to God all mortal Actions here,</br>And even the Thoughts of Men, do plain appear:</br>For from th' eternal Truth it doth proceed,</br>Through heavenly Vertue, which her Beams do breed.", "With the great Glory of that wondrous Light,</br>His Throne is all encompassed around,</br>And hid in his own Brightness from the sight</br>Of all that look thereon with Eyes unsound;</br>And underneath his Feet are to be found</br>Thunder and Lightning, and tempestuous fire,</br>The Instruments of his avenging Ire.", "There in his Bosom Sapience doth sit,</br>The sovereign Dearling of the Deity,</br>Clad like a Queen in royal Robes, most fit</br>For so great Powre and peerless Majesty;</br>And all with Gems and Jewels gorgeously</br>Adorn'd, that brighter than the Stars appear,</br>And make her native Brightness seem more clear.", "And on her Head a Crown of purest Gold</br>Is set, in sign of highest Sovereignty;</br>And in her Hand a Scepter she doth hold,</br>With which she rules the House of God on high,</br>And menageth the ever-moving Sky;</br>And in the same these lower Creatures all,</br>Subjected to her Powre imperial.", "Both Heaven and Earth obey unto her Will,</br>And all the Creatures which they both contain:</br>For of her Fulness which the World doth fill,</br>They all partake, and do in State remain,</br>As their great Maker did at first ordain;</br>Through observation of her high Beheast,</br>By which they first were made, and still increast.", "The Fairness of her Face no Tongue can tell;</br>For she, the Daughters of all Womens Race</br>And Angels eke in Beauty doth excell,</br>Sparkled on her from God's own glorious Face,</br>And more increast by her own goodly Grace,</br>That it doth far exceed all humane Thought</br>Ne can on Earth compared be to ought.", "Ne could that Painter (had he lived yet)</br>Which pictur'd Venus with so curious Quill,</br>That all Posterity admired it,</br>Have pourtray'd this, for all his maistring Skill;</br>Ne she her self, had she remained still,</br>And were as fair as fabling Wits do feign,</br>Could once come near this Beauty sovereign.", "But had those Wits, the Wonders of their Days,</br>Or that sweet Teian Poet, which did spend</br>His plenteous Vein in setting forth her Praise,</br>Seen but a glimpse of this, which I pretend;</br>How wondrously would he her Face commend,</br>Above that Idole of his faining Thought,</br>That all the World should With his Rimes be fraught?", "How then dare I, the Novice of his Art,</br>Presume to picture so divine a Wight,</br>Or hope t' express her least Perfections part,</br>Whose Beauty fills the Heavens with her Light,</br>And darks the Earth with shadow of her sight?</br>Ah gentle Muse, thou art too weak and faint,</br>The Pourtrait of so heavenly Hue to paint.", "Let Angels, which her goodly Face behold,</br>And see at will, her sovereign Praises sing,</br>And those most sacred Mysteries unfold,</br>Of that fair Love of mighty Heaven's King;</br>Enough is me t' admire so heavenly Thing:</br>And being thus with her huge Love possest,</br>In th' only Wonder of her self to rest.", "But whoso may, thrice happy Man, him hold,</br>Of all on Earth, whom God so much doth grace,</br>And lets his own Beloved to behold:</br>For in the view of her celestial Face,</br>All Joy, all Bliss, all Happiness have place;</br>Ne ought on Earth can want unto the Wight,</br>Who of her self can win the wishful Sight.", "For she, out of her secret Treasury,</br>Plenty of Riches forth on him will pour,</br>Even heavenly Riches, which there hidden lie</br>Within the Closet of her chastest Bowre,</br>Th' eternal Portion of her precious Dowre;</br>Which mighty God hath given to her free,</br>And to all those which thereof worthy be.", "None thereof worthy be, but those whom she</br>Vouchsafeth to her presence to receive,</br>And letteth them her lovely Face to see,</br>Whereof such wondrous Pleasures they conceive,</br>And sweet Contentment, that it doth bereave</br>Their Soul of Sense, through infinite Delight,</br>And them transport from Flesh into the Spright.", "In which they see such admirable Things,</br>As carries them into an Extasy,</br>And hear such heavenly Notes, and Carolings</br>Of God's high Praise, that fills the brasen Sky;</br>And feel such Joy and Pleasure inwardly,</br>That maketh them all worldly Cares forget,</br>And only think on that before them set.", "Ne from thenceforth doth any fleshly Sense,</br>Or idle Thought of earthly things remain;</br>But all that earst seem'd sweet, seems now offence,</br>And all that pleased earst, now seems to pain.</br>Their Joy, their comfort, their Desire, their Gain,</br>Is fixed all on that which now they see,</br>All other Sights but fained Shadows be.", "And that fair Lamp, which useth to enflame</br>The Hearts of Men with self-consuming fire,</br>Thenceforth seems foul, and full of sinful Blame;</br>And all th' Pomp to which proud Minds aspire</br>By Name of Honour, and so much desire,</br>Seems to them Baseness, and all Riches Dross,</br>And all Mirth Sadness, and all Lucre Loss.", "So full their Eyes are of that glorious Sight,</br>And Senses fraught with such Satietie,</br>That in nought else on Earth they can delight,</br>But in th' aspect of that Felicitie,</br>Which they have written in their inward Eye;</br>On which they feed, and in their fast'ned Mind</br>All happy Joy and full Contentment make.", "Ah then my hungry Soul, which long hast fed</br>On idle Fancies of my foolish Thought,</br>And with false Beauty's flattering Bait misled,</br>Hast after vain deceitful Shadows sought,</br>Which all are fled, and now have left thee nought,</br>But late Repentance through thy Folly's prief;</br>Ah!  cease to gaze on matter of thy Grief.", "And look at last up to that sovereign Light,</br>From whose pure Beams all perfect Beauty springs,</br>That kindleth Love in every godly Spright,</br>Even the Love of God, which Loathing brings</br>Of this vile World, and these gay-seeming Things;</br>With whose sweet Pleasures being so possest,</br>Thy straying Thoughts henceforth for ever rest.</br>"]
