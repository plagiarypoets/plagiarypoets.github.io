["When Majesty yielding to fate,</br>Receives as a mortal his doom,</br>What pomp must his burial await,</br>What splendor must nod o'er his tomb.</br>Fond fashion in sable disguise</br>Must seem to lament o'er his bier,</br>And the nation put on when he dies,</br>Political black &mdash; for a year.", "His virtues in life-time unknown,</br>Must stand to the reader confest;</br>And the chissel, indenting the stone,</br>Proclaim &mdash; what he never possest.</br>How silly, how vain this parade,</br>Such vanity all must deplore;</br>The marble by time is decay'd,</br>And the monarch is heard of no more.", "Departed in Life's humble vale,</br>How different is Corydon's lot,</br>His virtues o'er time shall prevail,</br>And live when e'en Kings are forgot;</br>The Shepherds who dwell on the plain,</br>Shall his fame to their children prolong,</br>And sigh, when rehearsing the strain,</br>\"This once was poor Corydon's song!\"", "Then, how solemn the sage shall repeat,</br>How silent the youths all attend,</br>\"Yon house was his pleasant retreat,</br>With Truth!  his companion, and friend:</br>What goodness still glow'd in his breast,</br>His loss to the plain, what a grief!</br>There the stranger was welcome to rest,</br>And the poor found a constant relief.", "\"Yon groves were his planting and care,</br>Where nature and art both unite,</br>The muse oft attended him there,</br>The muse that oft gave us delight;</br>How charming his pastoral reed,</br>What taste and simplicity join'd!</br>His songs were the sweetest agreed,</br>And forever they'll dwell in my mind.\"", "Ye Shepherds who honour his days,</br>Forgive me this trifling verse,</br>Believe me, I seek not for praise,</br>But sorrowing follow his hearse:</br>Yet why should such grief be exprest?</br>How idle, how vain is our woe!</br>Immortal!  he lives with the blest,</br>Eternal!  his fame is below.</br>"]
