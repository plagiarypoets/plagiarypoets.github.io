["Hail, daughter of Imperial War!</br>Hail, matchless Fortitude!  whose crown</br>Blazes with Glory's golden star,</br>Whose state the highest heavens enthrone.</br>To thee alone the Fates ordain</br>A fix'd unperishable reign,</br>And bless thee with such boundless sway,</br>That all Creation's powers thy ample rule obey.", "Beneath thy yoke the billowy sea</br>And stable earth's foundations lie;</br>To thee each nation bows the knee,</br>Immortal Empress of the Sky!</br>Ev'n Time, whose force all others own,</br>Submits, great Queen, to thee alone,</br>And never shifts the prosperous gale,</br>But with a constant breeze expands thy snowy sail.", "Thou to the warrior band giv'st birth,</br>Who in the battle dare to bleed,</br>Whose firm and patriotic worth</br>Emblazons each heroic deed!</br>The harvest of thy noble train</br>Appears like Ceres' joyous reign,</br>When o'er the fields the Goddess pours,</br>With free and liberal hand, her golden-waving stores.</br>"]
