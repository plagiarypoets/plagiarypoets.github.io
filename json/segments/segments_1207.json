["Hold, ruthless peasant!  hold thy lifted arm,</br>Nor let thy stroke my bleeding rind divide;</br>Ah!  let my hoary age thy pity warm!</br>Nor dare to pierce my venerable tide.", "Thy axe had echoed through the fertile meads;</br>The distant vallies spread wild havock o'er;</br>And shorn the mountains of their fringed heads</br>From yon tall mansion to the winding shore.", "And thou!  of all these fruitful plains the lord,</br>Avaunt! &mdash; the blasts of winter I've withstood;</br>And little aid would my old trunk afford,</br>Now fortune spurns thee in her angry mood.", "Thou fool!  'twas lux'ry laid thy honours low,</br>And ruin comes with delegated power;</br>Nor would my fall, though thou should'st strike the blow,</br>Protract his vengeance yet another hour!", "In vain did thunders, storms, and winds, and rain,</br>A thousant years my tow'ring limbs invade!</br>Thy father's fathers saw them rage in vain,</br>And found a safe asylum in my shade.", "Long have I reign'd the monarch of the woods!</br>A stately progeny I gave before,</br>Whose brawny limbs have cleft old Albions floods,</br>And borne her thunders to each distant shore!", "O!  bear my witness Hawke!  Boscawen!  Hyde!</br>The headlong billows ye have seen them brave;</br>From where Old Thames pours out his silver tide,</br>To distant Ganges with her crooked wave!", "O!  spare me! &mdash; for thy country too I plead!</br>Or soon her wrongs shall be reveng'd with mine!</br>The axe that lopps off my devoted head,</br>Shall from thy trembling body, sever thine!</br>"]
