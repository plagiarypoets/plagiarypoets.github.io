["To whom should I these pleasing paines commend,</br>My Muse hath tane Frugality to trace?</br>But to the Muses deare and noble friend,</br>Who, as in Honour, seekes to thrive in Grace:</br>Who, truly nob'e, honoureth his Place;</br>Nor for his Place is onely honoured:</br>Whom should the Muses more desire to grace,</br>Then whom they have up in their Bosomes bred;</br>And who with bounteous gifts them hath reguerdoned?", "Such Bounty is true Thrift:  Thus thou dost lay</br>Thy treasure up in heav'n; thus thou dost gaine:</br>By giving of some fading goods away,</br>True honour, which for ever shall remaine:</br>If thou wilt pleased be to entertaine</br>Thrift and her traine, into thy Patronage,</br>I boldly dare in her behalfe maintaine,</br>Shee is faire, bounteous, sober, grave and sage,</br>And fit to counsell thee, in Youth, in Strength, and Age.", "Next, Providence shall guide thee and protect,</br>In all wherein thine hand is diligent,</br>And holy Care and Labour shall direct</br>Thy Counsells to a just and good event,</br>To hav'n of Rest, to harbour of Content:</br>And if thou please to reade Deaths Meditation,</br>Thou shalt perceive her as an Herald sent,</br>To summon thee to heav'nly habitation,</br>To blessed Bride and Bridegroomes marriage-consummation:", "Most happy end of all, that rightly runne</br>Their courses in the dayes of vanity!</br>With Wisedomes study Solomon begun,</br>But ends all with this Epithalamie:</br>Sweet Swan-like Farewell of Mortality!</br>Taste of true Joy which ever shall remaine!</br>Then know, it is thy highest Dignitie,</br>This Earnest sure, of heav'n on earth, to gaine;</br>Which I will pray for, Thou must labour to attayne.</br>"]
