["When blue-ey'd Fancy, heavenly maid!</br>With sister arts and charms array'd,</br>Rose from her fairy chambers, wrought</br>By self-creating genius taught,</br>With purple wings she wav'd the air,</br>Prepar'd to leave her rosy sphere;</br>With magic art then veil'd her eyes,</br>And left the soft ambrosial skies,</br>To visit with her playful grace</br>The favor'd sons of mortal race.</br>To Grecian plains she bent her way,&mdash;</br>The fairy land for her display,&mdash;</br>And, when alighted on the earth,</br>What fairy regions hail'd her birth;</br>What figures wild, disorder'd, fair,</br>Forth danc'd, and shook their mystic hair.", "But when she held her glass to view,</br>The magic mirror of her charms,</br>The Grecian bard the goddess knew,</br>And hail'd her with extended arms.", "But, when the Mantuan swain beheld her,</br>He gently clasp'd the slender reed,</br>And sung an oaten song so tender,</br>'Twas Fancy's image to his aid.", "Lo!  when thy golden tresses fair</br>Wanton'd in the playful air,</br>And shook sweet odours from thy wing;</br>Then was the heav'n-inspiring hour,</br>And its secret working pow'r,</br>Sweet Spencer, elfin child, can sing.", "But oh!  thou sylph, with floating hair,</br>With bonny look, and gait so fair,</br>And eyes that sparkle inward pleasure;</br>Ah!  say the heav'n-inspiring view,</br>That first a laughing Comus drew,</br>The fair Miltonic fertile treasure.", "Oh!  see the shapes, how fast they rise,</br>The fleeting spectres of the mind;</br>Some potent spirit call'd them up,</br>'Twas Collins sure, &mdash; a favor'd child</br>That with a sweep, rude as the wind,</br>He struck, with hurried hand, the lyre,</br>And sung the 'Passions,' lofty theme,</br>The soul's delight, the Muses fire,</br>That fancy scarce withstood the power</br>That rul'd and govern'd in that hour.", "Thee last I sing, sweet Fancy's child,</br>The bard of numbers sweetly wild,</br>E'en Shakspeare, genius of the mount</br>By Hippocrene's sacred fount;</br>Who lov'd to range the chosen air</br>Where high poetic visions are;</br>But chiefly lov'd the heaven-born smile,</br>That lit thy temples all divine,</br>Sweet smiling goddess, soft array'd,</br>The poet's own fantastic maid.", "Thee, goddess, rule the varied year,</br>And wave thy wand around the sphere,</br>When Spring comes tripping o'er the land,</br>To scatter sweets with liberal hand,</br>With soft delight to press the earth;</br>Oh be then present at her birth,</br>To conjure with a livelier green,</br>And add a charm to ev'ry scene;</br>When o'er the burning zenith shines,</br>Oh seek the shade, where heat reclines,</br>By haunted stream, or fountain clear,</br>Where lovers drop the stealing tear,</br>Where laughing satyrs dance around,</br>And wood-nymphs from their alleys bound,</br>From out their leafy covert hie,</br>And view thy form with curious eye.", "A softer verdure clads the fields,</br>A richer grain the harvest yields,</br>When Ceres o'er the sheaf presides,</br>With rosy pleasure in her eyes;</br>When blushing fruits perfume the air,</br>The nymph of orchards tends with care;</br>While golden vintage sparkles round,</br>And laughing Bacchus, ivy crown'd,</br>With jollity, and dimpled smiles,</br>Surveys the cup of many wiles.", "When down the west the tardy sun declines,</br>Shorn of his locks of amber dipt in gold,</br>And the drear solstice sits upon the hills,</br>And the last sun-beam flies the wood,</br>When Nature throws her moody trail</br>Along the wide and dreary plain,</br>Then haste thee, goddess, bright and fair,</br>Oh come and deck thy braided hair,</br>Tho' now the gentle zephyr's fled,</br>Yet thou can'st deck each mountain's head,</br>And tho' the morning scented dew</br>Has lost its sweet and fragrant hue,</br>Yet thou can'st give the vales perfume,</br>And all the Summer's verdant bloom;</br>When the loud tempest rushes forth,</br>To hold its wild terrific course,</br>On the arrowy, sleety show'r,</br>I see thine all-pervading pow'r;</br>I see thee on the storm's career,</br>Thro' whirlwinds riding, void of fear.</br>Lo!  when the icy champion, Frost,</br>Forth holds his dread despotic course,</br>And chains the polar wat'ry deep,</br>And binds its waves in icy sleep,</br>Ah!  then thou tak'st thy rudest form,</br>Terrific as the midnight storm;</br>E'en then I see thee, gentle maid,</br>In some cavern reclining laid,</br>Which Nature, in her kindest mood,</br>Thus form'd to be the spot she lov'd;</br>Here, on a clear and crystal bed,</br>A sparkling radiance round thee shed,</br>Thou view'st the forms and shapes that rise,&mdash;</br>Spires, &mdash; villages, &mdash; delight thine eyes;</br>While mighty columns heave the arch,</br>And dancing tapers light the trance.", "The woods, &mdash; the rocks, &mdash; the swelling flood,&mdash;</br>The mountain steep, and quiet vale,&mdash;</br>The winding stream, that murmurs rude,</br>And lisps its purlings thro' the dale,&mdash;</br>The peeping dawn, &mdash; th' ascending fire,</br>That lifts the rising hills with joy,&mdash;</br>These thy fair form can e'er inspire,</br>Sweet Fancy, nymph so shy and coy.", "Sweet rosy maid, with colours drest,</br>Then come and be my welcome guest;</br>My humble roof should fairer rise</br>Beneath thy soft enchanting eyes;</br>With thee in hand, I fain would go,</br>More eager than the mountain roe,</br>And in thy flitting beams would play,</br>To chase Life's dreary clouds away;</br>Could the dear Muse of Shakspeare blest</br>But breathe its sweetness o'er my breast,</br>My winged soul would upward rise,</br>And like a bird that soars the skies,</br>Fond of her daring pinions, bold,</br>Fond of the space her eyes behold,</br>Would spurn with lighter feet away,</br>And soar amid the purple ray,</br>On the stretch'd wings of rapture rise,</br>With thee, O Fancy, by my side.</br>"]
