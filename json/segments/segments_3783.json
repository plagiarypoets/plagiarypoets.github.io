["Fair Venus' Son, what means thine heben Bow?</br>Thine Arrows whetted on a bloody Stone;</br>Thy Mother laughing at our captive Woe,</br>And all too weak this vain poetic Moan?</br>Why doth she spread her silken Nets so wide,</br>Or why enmesh unwares poor thoughtless Men?</br>Or why our gathered Laurels all deride,</br>And bid her Myrtle scorn'd, aye, freshly bloom again?", "Two gentle Youths, in Spenser's Lay well read,</br>Attentive to his manly virtuous Lore,</br>From Noise apart, and every Evil's Dread,</br>Life's Precepts hoarded, had a mighty Store.</br>What boot so late your Eyes to Sleep decline,</br>With studious Labours bought, or friendly Toil?</br>Your Arts, your Arms, says Lalage, resign,</br>And me triumphant view o'er every glorious Spoil.", "She said, and erst where foul Deformity,</br>Daughter of Chaos, held her ancient Reign;</br>Ne pleasaunt Herb yet grew, ne honour'd Tree,</br>Ne Virgin danc'd, ne sung had Shepherd Swain.</br>The rocky Soil upturn'd at thy Command,</br>Fair Lalage, all wond'ring I behold;</br>Walks, Flowers, Fruits, Trees in beauteous Order stand,</br>Creation! &mdash; likest Eden seem'd that happy Mold.", "But thou, chaste Eve, with ev'ry Grace adorn'd,</br>With Dignity, and soft attractive Love,</br>Hast thou thy votive Poet's Labour scorn'd,</br>And turn'd thy Chariot hence yborn by Dove?</br>Return, fair Nymph, and bless thy sweetest Bow'r,</br>Yet will I thee pursue with humble Vein:</br>Return, fair Nymph, and bless these Eyes once more,</br>And we shall lift thy Name with more Phoebean Strain.</br>"]
