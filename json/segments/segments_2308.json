["I slept; and lo!  upon my shrinking sight</br>The melancholy waste of ocean rose;</br>Not with its glassy pictures of delight,</br>When o'er its caves the glancing sunbeam throws</br>The peerless glory of a deep repose;</br>But like a world of waters, sounding high,</br>As when o'er Alps the rushing storm-clouds close;</br>Thus each roused foam-wreath whitened in the sky,</br>And blending with their roar, came Terror's funeral cry.", "Deep murmured unto deep; the up-heaving tide</br>Disclosed the skeleton, the diadem;</br>Once shrieks arose, to which no heart replied,</br>When the waves made a sepulchre for them,</br>As the storm-spirit heard the requiem,</br>And fanned the dun clouds with his dusky wing;</br>Young, bounding hearts, that scarce the air could stem,</br>To boundless depths were given, an offering,</br>Faded, as buds will fade, cut off in early spring!", "The staggering ships sank down into the brine,</br>The lightning went upon its hurried way;</br>Oh!  that a gift of eloquence were mine,</br>That stirring scene of horror to portray,</br>All mingled in one dark and dim array!</br>I stood upon the shore; the lone gull near,</br>As he swept onward through the troubled spray,</br>Shook his stern pinions by my startled ear,</br>Hastening, with screams of joy, upon his proud career!", "I woke!  'Twas morning &mdash; in the infant year&mdash;</br>Roused by the voices of the early spring,</br>How danced my heart, as eloquent and clear</br>The reckless wild birds chanted on the wing,</br>Pouring their lays, a sinless offering!</br>While silver streams by meadow verdure wound</br>Far through the pleasant landscape glistening,</br>As buds bent humbly to the dewy ground,</br>And steeped in golden light, the blue hills stretched around!</br>"]
