["Ah!  why from these woodlands retire?</br>Why plunge amid folly and noise?</br>Has Emma forgot to admire</br>These plains and their innocent joys?</br>Ah!  will she abandon the grove,</br>And haste from her Daphne away!</br>Shall the friend, whom she once deign'd to love,</br>In vain then solicit her stay?", "Can the pleasure, which cities impart,</br>Compare with the pastoral plain&mdash;</br>Where Nature still governs the heart,</br>And Truth and Simplicity reign?</br>Can Pomp to the bosom give ease?</br>Can Fashion our pleasures improve?</br>Can the language of flattery please,</br>Like the language of friendship and love?", "And oh, my lov'd Emma!  beware&mdash;</br>Nor tempt the base arts of undoers;</br>Too surely they spread out the snare,</br>For bosoms so artless as yours.</br>Shall Maria's sad fate be in vain?</br>Shall we practise the faults we deplore?</br>She too would depart from the plain&mdash;</br>But she never knew happiness more.</br>"]
