["Give ear, oh ye swains, to my lay,</br>Since Colin, alas!  is no more;</br>Let's languish and pine all the day,</br>In sorrow his loss to deplore:</br>For he was the pride of the plain,</br>The garden, the grove and the field;</br>But \"lost is the pastoral strain,\"</br>Since he no more beauties can yield.", "Ye warblers, that bill on each spray,</br>Ye lambkins, that wantonly roam,</br>Come round, and attend to the lay&mdash;</br>Then \"bleat and your master bemoan;\"</br>For a tender good shepherd was he,</br>So true and so kind to his trust,</br>With mildness he e'er painted thee,</br>No swain sure was ever so just.", "His manner how soft and serene!</br>How pleasing his shape and his air!</br>No mortal like him e'er was seen,</br>No mortal with him could compare:</br>For he was so gentle and kind,</br>That bird's cluster'd round in a throng,</br>And all in full harmony join'd,</br>Whenever he echo'd his song.", "But, ah!  the dear Colin is gone!</br>No longer he sings thro' the grove;</br>No longer beneath the gay thorn</br>He pours forth his accents of love:</br>Then farewell!  oh favourite bard!</br>Adieu!  my dear Colin!  adieu!</br>Thy worth I shall ever regard,</br>To thy fame I will ever be true.</br>"]
