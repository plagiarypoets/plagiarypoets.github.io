["Genius of Spencer, dost thou hover near</br>The favoured banks of Mulla's pastoral stream?</br>Or midst Rosanna's groves, to science dear,</br>Lovest thou to bid thy former lustre beam?</br>Alas!  how short-lived this delicious gleam!</br>How soon are closed in everlasting sleep</br>Those eyes which caught new radiance from the theme!</br>Now, while their tears the flowers of fancy steep,</br>Sad Psyche and her love o'er the pale marble weep.</br>"]
