["I.</br>Sweet god of ease!  whose opiate breath</br>Pour'd gently o'er the heaving breast,</br>Steals like the solemn hand of Death,</br>And sheds the balm of visionary rest;</br>Come, with ev'ry powerfull spell</br>From the hermit's gloomy cell,</br>From the swallow's mossy bed,</br>When bleak Winter blasts the mead;</br>Come with Night's cold, cloudy brow,</br>With sky-rob'd Thought demure and slow,</br>With Rest, that charms the drowsy air,</br>And folds the wakeful eyes of melancholy Care.", "II.</br>O, by thy robe of purest white,</br>Thy tresses bound with funeral yew,</br>Thy voice that sooths the ear of Night,</br>Thine ebon rod that sweeps the pearly dew;</br>By the pale moon's trembling beam,</br>By the ghosts on Lethe's stream;</br>By the silent solemn gloom,</br>By the beetle's drowsy hum,</br>By the zephyr's dying breath,</br>When sleeps th' unruffled wave beneath;</br>By the long voice of murm'ring seas,</br>Lull each reposing sense in calm, oblivious ease.", "RECITATIVE.</br>Pour on my soul the sweetly-melting lay,</br>That once on Argus could prevail;</br>When sooth'd by Hermes' wondrous tale,</br>Each list'ning sense dissolv'd and dy'd away:</br>Lull'd by the magic doubling sound,</br>Slow-stealing Slumber lock'd his iron breast;</br>His thoughts in sweet delirium drown'd,</br>His falling arms the god confess'd:</br>On his numb'd ear and wavering soul</br>The hollow murmur feebly stole:</br>O'erpower'd at last, he yields the beauteous prize,</br>And drops supinely down, and folds an hundred eyes.", "III.</br>Then too let bold-ey'd Fancy come,</br>With bright'ning look and bosom bare,</br>Her features flush'd with vivid bloom,</br>With fluttering wings, and loosely-flowing hair:</br>Then let all the bursting soul</br>Boldly dart from pole to pole;</br>Starting from the airy steep,</br>Lightly skim the wavy deep:</br>Up the rough rock let me climb,</br>'Till thy strong voice, with note sublime,</br>Wakes, fires, and thrills with rapid strains,</br>And leads the lighten'd mind to soft Elysian plains.", "IV.</br>Yet then let no fantastic tale,</br>No ruder thought disturb the dream;</br>But bear me to some lonely dale,</br>Where weeps the willow o'er the murm'ring stream;</br>Or where in the bowery shade</br>Quiet leans her drooping head,</br>Where from the hollow cave beneath</br>Sweeps the wild wind through the heath;</br>Or with notes that deeply more,</br>Wake all the tuneful soul of Love;</br>Let bright Lucinda's charms arise,</br>With all the dazzling flame, the lightning of her eyes.", "RECITATIVE.</br>Then on the rapid wings of Fancy born,</br>Bold let me soar with steady flight,</br>Where bursts the radiant blaze of light,</br>Or where Aurora sheds the rosy morn:</br>Or lead me where the warbling Nine</br>With flying fingers touch the melting lyre;</br>There sooth with harmony divine,</br>Or nobly breathe celestial fire:</br>Or in the soft Idalian grove,</br>With all the Graces let me rove,</br>Where gay Anacreon haunts the genial bow'r,</br>And crowns the blushing nymph with every balmy flow'r.", "V.</br>Oft too with Spenser let me tread</br>The Fairy field where Una strays;</br>Or loll in Pleasure's flowery bed,</br>Or burst to heav'n in Milton's high-wrought lays:</br>Or on Ariel's airy wing,</br>Let me chase the young-ey'd Spring,</br>Where the powder'd cowslips bloom,</br>Where the wild thyme breathes perfume:</br>Or with solemn steps and sad,</br>Slow let me haunt the deep'ning shade,</br>Where Hamlet, thro' the op'ning ground,</br>Beheld the white-rob'd Ghost, and mark'd the gushing wound.", "VI.</br>Come, gentle god, with magic wand</br>Of power, to calm the soul of Care,</br>From Envy's grasp to loose the brand,</br>Or lull th' envenom'd snakes that prompt despair:</br>Bring thy vision's airy show,</br>Yews that wave o'er Lethe slow,</br>Glimmering beams, and taper blue,</br>Rod that drops with Stygian dew,</br>Sloth on down supinely laid,</br>And slow-ey'd Ease that droops the head,</br>Pale Languor wrapt in thoughtless gaze,</br>And wild Oblivion lost in Fancy's boundless maze.", "RECITATIVE.</br>See, Night's dun robe involves the pathless waste,</br>Black clouds in heaps confus'dly thrown,</br>Roll awful o'er her gloomy throne:</br>While through the dark cave sweeps the plaintive blast:</br>Yon car by boding ravens led,</br>Bears the lone Goddess through the murky gloom;</br>Before slow Darkness breathes her shade,</br>And Rest forsakes the yawning tomb.</br>Around at midnight's solemn noon,</br>Rapt Fancy gazes on the moon:</br>Care folds her arms, nor knows th' unpleasing theme,</br>And Grief dissolving shares the sweetly-soothing dream.</br>"]
