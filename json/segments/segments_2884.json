["O gentle Sleep!  Shall the rude voice</br>Of sober dulness, whose cold thought</br>Muses on golden dross and vulgar joys,</br>Shall such rude voice condemn thy peaceful reign!", "What though, before the bright-hair'd morn</br>In glory walks the Eastern hills,</br>Swift from his bed of care the poor-rich man</br>Starts, and renews the drudge of each dull day;", "Shall I, lov'd sleep, whose idle thought</br>E'er loves the airy wilds to roam</br>Of fancy, shall I blame thine opiate power,</br>And burst thy silken bands, and fly from peace?", "No gentle sleep!  the while the world</br>Renews at earliest morn the toil</br>Of empty cares &mdash; then I on down diffus'd</br>With thee will pass the hours in visions fair.", "How sweet when Winter's fleecy snows</br>From the low clouds steal silent, soft,</br>And whiten the cold earth, that bloom'd so late</br>Hill, vale, and grove in liveliest green array'd;", "How sweet to ope my heavy eyes</br>And thro' the window glaz'd to view</br>The fleecy snows, the whiten'd earth &mdash; then bless my couch,</br>And steal again to rest, and gentle dreams.", "For fancy wild, that never sleeps,</br>To sunny climes, to streams and shades</br>Wanton shall fly; where breathes its airy tones</br>The Aeolian harp, by zephyrs lightly fann'd,", "Where golden fruits and purple wines</br>Glow to the eye; where Delia's form</br>Shall brighten thro' the grove, like those soft powers</br>Wood-nymph or goddess, or like the first fair,", "Eve, &mdash; who in Eden's hallow'd bowers</br>The Father of Mankind encharm'd.</br>Instant I fly, all fir'd, to those white arms,</br>To that white breast of love; &mdash; with tenderest voice", "What though she chide each wanton kiss</br>And murmur anger in sweet sighs;&mdash;</br>Yet shall her yielding charms with happiest joy</br>Bless my warm vows, my fondest wishes bless.</br>"]
