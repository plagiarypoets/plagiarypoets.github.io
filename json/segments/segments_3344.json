["Cousin, day-birds are silenc't, and those fowl</br>Yet onely sing, which hate warm Phoebus light;</br>Th' unlucky Parrat, and death-boding Owl,</br>Which ush'ring in to heav'n their mistress Night,</br>Hollow their mates, triumphing o're the quick-spent Light.", "The wronged Philomel hath left to plain</br>Tereus contraint and cruel ravishment:</br>Seems the poore bird hath lost her tongue again.</br>Progne long since is gone to banishment;</br>And the loud-tuned Thrush leaves all her merriment.", "All so my frozen Muse, hid in my breast,</br>To come into the open aire refuses;</br>And dragg'd at length from hence, doth oft protest,</br>This is no time for Phoebus-loving Muses;</br>When the farre-distant sunne our frozen coast disuses.", "Then till the sunne, which yet in fishes hasks,</br>Or watry urn, impounds his fainting head,</br>'Twixt Taurus horns his warmer beam unmasks,</br>And sooner rises, later goes to bed;</br>Calling back all the flowers, now to their mother fled:", "Till Philomel resumes her tongue again,</br>And Progne fierce returns from long exiling;</br>Till the shrill Blackbird chants his merry vein;</br>And the day-birds the long-liv'd sunne beguiling,</br>Renew their mirth, and the yeares pleasant smiling:", "Here must I stay, in sullen study pent,</br>Among our Cambridge fennes my time misspending;</br>But then revisit our long-long'd for Kent.</br>Till then live happy, the time ever mending:</br>Happy the first o' th' yeare, thrice happy be the ending.</br>"]
