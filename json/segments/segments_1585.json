["\"Fond dreamer!  meditate thine idle song,</br>But let thine idle song remain unknown:\"</br>O guard its beauties from the vulgar throng,</br>Unveil its charms to friendship's eye alone.</br>To thee shall friendship's partial praise atone</br>For all the incense of the world beside;</br>Unthinking mirth may slight thy pensive tone,</br>Folly may scorn, or ignorance deride:&mdash;</br>The lay so idly sung, let prudence teach to hide.", "Sweet Minstrel!  couldst thou think a song like thine,</br>With grace replete, with harmony inspir'd,</br>Thy timid modesty could e'er confine</br>Within those limits which thy fears desir'd?</br>Ah no!  by all approv'd, by all admir'd,</br>Its charms shall captivate each listening ear;</br>Thy \"Psyche,\" by the hand of taste attir'd,</br>To virtue, grace, and delicacy dear,</br>Shall consecrate thy name for many a future year.", "Oh!  had indulgent heaven but spar'd thy Lyre,</br>Which first it strung and tun'd to melody,</br>How many a heart had felt encreasing fire,</br>Dwelling enraptur'd on its minstrelsy:</br>How many an ear had drank its harmony,</br>And listen'd to its strains with sweet delight;</br>But He, whose righteous will is sovereignty,</br>Hath bid thy sun of glory set in night,</br>And, though we mourn thy loss, we own his sentence right.", "Yet, plaintive Songstress!  on thy gentle lay</br>Fancy with pensive tenderness shall dwell;</br>Memory shall snatch from Time thy transient day,</br>And soft regret each feeling breast shall swell.</br>But, why regret?  Let faith, exulting, tell</br>That she, whose tuneful voice had sung before,</br>In allegoric strain, love's witching spell,</br>Now sings HIS love whom wondering worlds adore,</br>And still shall chaunt his Praise when time shall be no more.</br>"]
