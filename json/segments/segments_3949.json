["Hail, SAV'RY COMPOUND!  luscious to the taste;</br>The school-boy's heart delighting!  sweet reward</br>Of many a tedious hour in penance sad</br>Of lab'ring erudition.  Oft hast thou</br>Been brought to view by strong anticipation,</br>When poring over books, or conning loath</br>The lesson of dull grammar.  When at school</br>The scanty table nothing did present</br>But suet dumplings, or hard mutton boil'd,</br>How has thy minc'd-meat danc'd before the eyes</br>Of greedy visionary!  how possess'd</br>The mazes of his brain!  then to his view</br>Did his dear HOME return; his parents' smiles,</br>His evening visits, and perhaps his joy</br>At Play house, where the busy Pantomime</br>Bewitch'd the time away.  Then to return</br>To sup, to eat MINCE PIES!  drink luscious wine!</br>To keep the list'ning circle list'ning still,</br>'Till after midnight, when the little ELF,</br>On his soft pillow, DREAMS OF SCHOOL AGAIN!</br>"]
