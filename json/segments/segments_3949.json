["Adieu to the village delights,</br>Which lately my fancy enjoy'd;</br>No longer the country invites,</br>To me all its pleasures are void.", "Adieu thou sweet health-breathing hill,</br>Thou can'st not my comfort restore;</br>For ever adieu my dear ville,</br>My Emma, alas!  is no more.", "She, she was the cure of my pain,</br>My blessing, my honour, my pride;</br>She ne'er gave me cause to complain,</br>Till that fatal day when she died.", "Her eyes that so beautiful shone,</br>Are closed forever in sleep;</br>And mine, since my Emma is gone,</br>Have nothing to do but to weep.", "Could my tears the bright angel restore,</br>Like a fountain they never should cease;</br>But Emma, alas!  is no more,</br>And I am a stranger to peace.", "Let me copy with fervour devout,</br>The virtues which glow'd in her heart;</br>Then soon, when life's sand is run out,</br>We shall meet again, never to part.</br>"]
