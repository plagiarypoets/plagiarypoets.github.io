["Minstrel!  why hangs on yonder elm unstrung</br>That harp whose strains' to listening thousands dear,</br>Could, when thy hand across its strings was flung,</br>Both touch the heart, and captivate the ear?</br>If valour's partial smile, or beauty's tear</br>Repaid in earlier time its magic strain,</br>Small cause hast thou, enchanting bard!  to fear</br>That thou the lay shalt ever tune in vain,</br>Rejoice without applause, without redress complain.", "'Tis thine with fairy pencil to pourtray</br>The striking beauties of the highland scene;</br>The lonely glen, where scarce the solar ray</br>Can penetrate the spreading boughs between;</br>The towering crags, bedeck'd with foliage green,</br>The lake which laves the foot of Benvenue,</br>Now dark with clouds, now bright with summer sheen;</br>The landscape's varied charms delight the view,</br>Glittering in morning's beams, or evening's richer hue.", "Whether thy song commemorate the Graeme,</br>Or prompt for Douglas the relenting sigh;</br>Or royal James, disguis'd in humble name,</br>Or savage Roderick, Alpine's chief be nigh;</br>Or whether pearly drop from Ellen's eye</br>Awake the gentler feelings of the heart;</br>'Tis thine, bewitching bard!  each theme to try</br>Which joy, or grief, or wonder can impart;</br>Can cause the breast to throb or pitying tear to start.", "Oh!  strike once more the Caledonian Lyre,</br>Which silent hangs on Fillan's wizard tree;</br>The flowing numbers fancy shall inspire,</br>And breathe a Lay romantic, rich, and free.</br>From barren Caithness to the southern sea,</br>Shall every clan unite to spread thy fame;</br>Each scotish maid shall weave a wreath for thee,</br>Each rocky cliff reverberate thy name,</br>And every tongue combine thy glory to proclaim.</br>"]
