["Amidst Campania Fields, near Sabine Bowers,</br>Plain to each view there stood two stately Towers,</br>Mounting aloft the skies their cloudy heads,</br>As proud as high, disdaining their first Beds;</br>So curious was their building, and their stone,</br>That both alike, they both were took for one,</br>Shewing by'th' type of their conjoyning arts,</br>The true conjunction of each others hearts.</br>Two stately Towers for their buildings fam'd,</br>One Arathea, th' other Talmos nam'd;</br>In Talmos, Sepha dwelt, whose heav'nly face,</br>Gave to each quill a line, each line a grace,</br>In whispring forth her praise, whose radiant eyes,</br>Like starry lamps that emulate the skies,</br>In height and beauty with their glittering light,</br>Shone like the clearest stars i' th' darkest night.</br>Upon her head she wore a Laurell Crown</br>Knit up with sundry flowers, on which Renown,</br>As chiefest Empress of her fate and beauty,</br>Did sympathize with a religious duty:</br>Hesperides, in whose calm heart did rest</br>No sullen strains, but Lyrick, and a nest</br>Of Heav'nly raptures, perfum'd odours sweet,</br>Which Nectar and Nepenthe breathings, meet</br>For Heav'ns great Queen, such was her vertue given,</br>That where she was, there was a second Heav'n.</br>Her face so sweet as Nature can devise,</br>Was drest with sparkling Diamonds of her eyes,</br>The sweet composure of whose beauty yeelds</br>A Medall of the true Elisian fields;</br>Her forehead, fittest place to go before,</br>(Since who so speaks of beauty treads it o're)</br>Was justly call'd a path, whereon did pass,</br>A way that leads you where all beauty was.</br>Close by that path, two radiant lamps did rise,</br>Which some abruptly did intitle eyes;</br>Too mean a name for two such Heav'nly lights,</br>As far beyond all eyes, as dayes from nights:</br>To whom was added that Coelestiall grace</br>Of perfect pureness to adorn the face,</br>That whensoe're these seeing lamps did move,</br>They'd light spectators on their way to love.</br>Between which eyes (if eyes they may be nam'd)</br>A pillar, (as of purest marble fram'd)</br>Then call'd her nose, did lead you to two plains,</br>Pure white and red, like milk which clarret stains.</br>Two flowry fields where Flora seem'd to dwell,</br>Where white and red were striving to excell,</br>Whose raptures seem'd like a Celestiall nest,</br>Whereon distressed lovers seem'd to rest,</br>Which Paradise if any lover seeks,</br>It was presented in fair Sepha's cheeks,</br>Two pearls of that inestimable price,</br>So far beyond th' perfection of her eyes,</br>Impall'd with that excessive form of bliss,</br>Smiling, you'd think th' invited you to kiss.</br>What name or title fits fair Sepha's lips?</br>Shall some Ambrosian cup, where great Jove sips</br>Nectar from Ganimed?  too mean it is,</br>To bear their form, it is too mean by this,</br>Jove out of them Nepenthe us'd to sip,</br>But that Nepenthe grew on Sepha's lip.</br>Then gan her teeth in a most perfect line,</br>Plac't each by other through her lips to shine,</br>More white, more true, than Nature could prefer</br>To any other was it not to her.</br>Those that ne're saw, might judge what they had been,</br>Like picture pearl, through crimson shadows seen;</br>So was her chin like Christall over red,</br>So was her hair in decent manner spred;</br>Which she all careless down her back did wear,</br>As a fit object for the wanton Air,</br>Careless to sport with, next to them was prais'd</br>Her neck, as of a Marble pillar rais'd,</br>Proud to support the weight of such a face,</br>In whom three Graces seem'd to be one grace.</br>Then might you see her Amber brests, more white</br>Than Scithian snow, and yeelding more delight</br>Than silly quill is able to report,</br>They were the hills where Cupid us'd to sport.</br>Between which hills there lay a pleasant Alley,</br>Whose milky paths did lead into the Valley.</br>This was that Sepha who unhappy dy'd,</br>This was that Sepha for whose hap I cry'd;</br>This was that Sepha, whom the Valleys miss,</br>And this was her whose Tragick stories this.</br>Sepha, the glory of the scorned earth,</br>In Talmos dwelt, sometimes a place of mirth,</br>The ground whereon it stood was deck't with flowers,</br>Here lay a Meadow, there were Sabine bowers.</br>The house was with a Grove of trees inclos'd,</br>Proud of the beauty that therein repos'd:</br>Only a glead there lay, the trees between,</br>Where Arathea was of Talmos seen.</br>In Arathea young Arcadius dwelt,</br>A man where Nature had so freely dealt</br>Her chiefest art, and artificiall skill,</br>Pleasing each eye, but most to Sephas will.</br>Oft by her window did Arcadius ride,</br>Sometimes to hunt, and sometimes to divide</br>The Air with riding swift Italian horses,</br>Here making stops, there running at full courses,</br>When she (unknown to him) with watchfull eye,</br>Oft saw his going, and his coming by,</br>So that of fire which Lovers sometimes find,</br>A spark began to kindle in her mind.</br>Once did she blame unkindly Cupid much;</br>Darling said she, and is thy power such?</br>Unkindly thus pure streams to overcome,</br>And force a heart to love she knows not whom?</br>Is he too good that thus thou dost deny</br>Me to receive one courting from his eye?</br>Cupid, scorn'st thou my prayers?  or dost thou shame?</br>Is he so mean to let me know his name?</br>Yet let me live, let me his feature see,</br>If hee's but vertuous, 'tis enough for me.</br>This said, her eyes drawn by a heavy sound,</br>Saw young Arcadius, groveling on the ground,</br>Whose too too nimble horse, in striving most</br>To please his master, his blest burthen lost.</br>Once did she speak, once did she move her tongue,</br>What sad mishap said she, did thee that wrong?</br>How didst thou of thy wonted favours miss?</br>Was the ground greedy thy fair limbs to kiss?</br>At whose Celestiall voice, like a sweet charm,</br>He started up, and said, I had no harm;</br>Thanks for your love, and with a decent grace,</br>Stoops down his hat, by which she saw his face.</br>Sepha (said she) be glad, for thou hast found,</br>And seen the Arrow that thy heart did wound.</br>Well, young Arcadius gets him to his steed,</br>Who guilty of the last unhappy deed,</br>With nimble strokes his master to delight,</br>Slips o're the plain from fairest Sepha's sight.</br>Go then, said she, the height of beauties pride,</br>And worlds chief mirror; if thy heart is ty'd</br>To any Lady whom thou call'st thy own,</br>As sure it is, or else thou wouldst have shown</br>Some more respects to me, but if thou art,</br>If to another thou hast linkt thy heart,</br>Twice happy thou, thrice she, that shall imbrace</br>Thy slender body, and enjoy thy face.</br>This said, she to a silent chamber goes,</br>Weary of love, but more of mind, and throws,</br>Sometimes her restless body on a bed,</br>Where love is with imaginations fed,</br>Then to the window would she take her way,</br>And view the place where young Arcadius lay,</br>Thence would she to her closet, where alone,</br>Alone she sate her sorrowes to bemone;</br>If such was Isis love to Lignus son,</br>Then ignorant why he her love had won,</br>And Iphis had in his Ianthe got,</br>Not yet a man, yet more than one mans lot?</br>If such was Philoclea's ardent love,</br>From her own sex, such free desires to move?</br>When Zelmaenes eyes such direfull vapors threw,</br>And to her own, prodigious accents drew?</br>If Isis was of Iphis change most glad?</br>And Philoclea her own wishes had?</br>Why may not Sepha be possest of hers,</br>Not half so far impossible as theirs?</br>But Heav'n conspird with an impatient eye,</br>And all the powers to act her Tragedy.</br>Not that Injustice with the Gods did dwell,</br>For how could they 'gainst that sweet face rebell,</br>Nor enmity against such beauty bred,</br>Whose double portion with amazement led</br>Each greedy eye into a feild of Roses</br>And Lillies which a Theatre incloses.</br>But Love whose passions with impartiall flames,</br>Now whisper'd 'mongst the Gods, aloud proclaims,</br>By Joves consent to dispossesse us here</br>Of our faire Heav'n, for they did want her there:</br>Conspicuous fate, her heart already feels</br>Cupids dire bolt, and at first Arrow yeelds;</br>No Warrier she, nor striv'd with strugling hand</br>The dart to break, nor would she it withstand,</br>But gently stepping t'wards his Bow did hie,</br>And Phoenix-like into the flames did flie;</br>So Pilomel doth willingly depose,</br>Her tender brest against the Thorne, so those</br>Who (Bleeding easly) meet death void of paine,</br>Phasiphae so in Ida woods did raigne.</br>Twice did the honour of Latona move</br>A scornd defiance to Arcadius Love,</br>But twice by Ericyna twas defac't,</br>And twice more Love into her heart was plac't,</br>Wherefore unwilling to omit the art,</br>The Salve she thought would mollifie her smart,</br>Half doubting Cupid who such change had wrought,</br>Gave speech the leave, to ease her of her thought.", "Love, who the greatest Potentates can tame,</br>(Ruine of zeale) at whose majestick name,</br>(Blind wicked boy) disguiz'd with all untruth,</br>The Gods have yeelded honour to his youth,</br>Sprung first from Venus Goddess of his art,</br>If blind as some suppose how can he dart</br>Showrs of such wrongs on silly Womans heart?", "Thou Goddess of the Vallies and the Plains,</br>See how the wagg thy sacred rites disdains,</br>Thou thou Latona's Daughter, whose delights</br>I vow to perfect, and maintain thy rites,</br>In spite of Cupid, see how he deposes</br>Thy Holy Lawes, see how he plucks thy Roses,</br>And crops the fairest Lillies of thy Closes.", "Into my heart some heavy thought is straid,</br>But there it shall not, nor long hath it staid,</br>Some muddy cloud hath overwhelm'd my face,</br>And left behind it shaddowes of disgrace:</br>Thus when the Heav'ns thy mighty Father lowrs,</br>His anger is some bitter tasted showrs,</br>To perish quite the odours of thy flowers.", "Thus hath he given power to the Boy,</br>Who strives thy Virgin odours to destroy,</br>Urg'd by the daughter of Oceanus</br>His Frothy Mother, enemy to us.</br>And she doth practice his deceitfull smiles,</br>The fittest motions with which he beguiles,</br>And with a touch thy Vestall lamps defiles.", "Up (thou Alphea) shew thy pow'r and skill,</br>Reserve thy virgins wholly to thee still,</br>Lend us the swiftest Arethusa's feet,</br>To flie Alpheus, make our prayers fleet:</br>And that we may doe honor to thy name,</br>Do thou in Ephesus thy will proclame,</br>That we with nettles may defie his flame.", "Thus did she feed her thoughts on weak dispair,</br>Sighing her sorrows to the empty air,</br>Repining only that her heavy fate</br>Prest down so hard to make her derogate.", "Might I (said she) Idalia's garments wear,</br>I would be glad, would she but hear my prayer,</br>Or Dian thou to whom I am devoted,</br>Admit not my true zeal to be remoted</br>From service thine, if still thy power thou hast;</br>If Citherea hath it not defac't,</br>Say whether yet he any hath imbrac't.", "Say whether yet he any hath embrac't,</br>If yet to thee his service be ally'd,</br>Let not his cheeks of any sorrows tast,</br>'Tis pity such pure streams with worse be dy'd;</br>But

love, retires</br>Into the garden, where she takes free scope</br>To vent her plaints, but all deny her hope.</br>Each flow'r she sees gives a fresh appetite</br>To that sweet flowr she wants; there's no delight,</br>But dreams and visions haunt her in her sleep;</br>The birds that us'd to sing, now seem'd to weep,</br>And all with heavy voice did seem to move</br>Complaints, and wail for her unhappy love.</br>Nor could she say 'twas love did her oppress,</br>Since she was ignorant of what fair guess</br>She was enamored, she saw his face,</br>And knew he was a man, but of what race</br>And name she knew not, nor knew where he dwelt;</br>(Oft so for unknown cause, strange pains are felt)</br>Oft from the garden would she send her eyes,</br>Loves faint Embassadors, into the
