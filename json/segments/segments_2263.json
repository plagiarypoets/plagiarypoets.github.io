["What Shepherd so sweetly complains,</br>In ditties so mournful and kind?</br>Sure Corydon gladdens the plains,</br>And murmurs his woes in the wind;</br>Releas'd from the mansions of death,</br>In pity to Woodhouse's grief,</br>Once more he makes use of his breath,</br>To grant him a sigh, or relief.", "Sweet fancy continue the dream,</br>And let me not lose him again,</br>O my heart how delightful the theme</br>To imagine it Corydon's strain;</br>But, alas, busy thought pushes on,</br>And bids the delusions depart,</br>It tells me for ever he's gone,</br>And grief again strikes thro' my heart.", "Yet still there's some comfort remains;</br>Whoever was Corydon's friend,</br>Ye Lovers, ye Nymphs, and fond Swains,</br>To the Shepherd's last will now attend:</br>When death grimly stalk'd o'er the field</br>And ended his exquisite song,</br>The Dryads assistance to yield</br>Around their dear favourite throng:", "They cull'd from the stores of the woods</br>Each herb for its virtue renown'd,</br>The Naiads too gave from their floods</br>Each water that wholesome was found;</br>When Corydon rear'd up his shead,</br>And cry'd ye kind Nymphs 'tis in vain,</br>I soon shall be told with the dead,</br>No balsam can lessen my pain;", "Then tell my last words to the Swains,</br>When they miss me their pastimes among,</br>A Corydon to them remains</br>Well skill'd in the carrol and song,</br>'Tis PORTAL, go bear him this reed,</br>No voice can his sonnet exceed</br>When prompted by friendship and love.</br>"]
