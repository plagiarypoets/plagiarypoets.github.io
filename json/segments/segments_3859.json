["See!  see! from the east how the god of the day</br>All rosy brings on the new morn;</br>How the dew-drops hang pendent from every spray,</br>And the songsters enliven the thorn;</br>Not a violet, a harebell, or sweet-flavour'd rose,</br>Or aught of the daisied lawn,</br>Not a soft sighing zephyr, or streamlet that flows,</br>But smiles at the blush of the dawn.", "From the heath-cover'd hills are the shadows dispell'd,</br>And the vapours exhal'd from the glade;</br>The pale glimm'ring moon by the sun is excell'd,</br>And Aurora revisits the shade:</br>The drowsy god Morpheus, oblig'd to retire,</br>Gives to shepherds the sweets of the morn;</br>While the skies to the eastward appear as the fire,</br>And nature as recently torn.", "In the cottage recluse, where good harmony dwells,</br>The ploughman awakes with the sun,</br>And hies him, contented, o'er uplands and dells,</br>To finish his labours begun:</br>The milk-maid, enamour'd of pastoral life,</br>Repairs to her task on the hill;</br>Her ambition but asks to be Corydon's wife,</br>Or Patie's who lives in the mill.", "Come then, my Alexis, away let us rove,</br>The sweets of the morn to partake;</br>To the god of the seasons, in anthems of love,</br>Let our matins extatic awake:</br>Creation rejoices &mdash; The birds from each tree</br>Invite us to join in the lay;</br>Why then to their Maker should rationals be</br>More proud or ungrateful than they?</br>"]
