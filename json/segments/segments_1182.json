["When by my solitary hearth I sit,</br>And hateful thoughts enwrap my soul in gloom;</br>When no fair dreams before my \"mind's eye\" flit,</br>And the bare heath of life presents no bloom;</br>Sweet Hope, ethereal balm upon me shed,</br>And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head.", "Whene'er I wander, at the fall of night,</br>Where woven boughs shut out the moon's bright ray,</br>Should sad Despondency my musings fright,</br>And frown, to drive fair Cheerfulness away,</br>Peep with the moon-beams through the leafy roof,</br>And keep that fiend Despondence far aloof.", "Should Disappointment, parent of Despair,</br>Strive for her son to seize my careless heart;</br>When, like a cloud, he sits upon the air,</br>Preparing on his spell-bound prey to dart:</br>Chace him away, sweet Hope, with visage bright,</br>And fright him as the morning frightens night!", "Whene'er the fate of those I hold most dear</br>Tells to my fearful breast a tale of sorrow,</br>O bright-eyed Hope, my morbid fancy cheer;</br>Let me awhile thy sweetest comforts borrow:</br>Thy heaven-born radiance around me shed,</br>And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head!", "Should e'er unhappy love my bosom pain,</br>From cruel parents, or relentless fair;</br>O let me think it is not quite in vain</br>To sigh out sonnets to the midnight air!</br>Sweet Hope, ethereal balm upon me shed,</br>And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head!", "In the long vista of the years to roll,</br>Let me not see our country's honour fade:</br>O let me see our land retain her soul,</br>Her pride, her freedom; and not freedom's shade.</br>From thy bright eyes unusual brightness shed&mdash;</br>Beneath thy pinions canopy my head!", "Let me not see the patriot's high bequest,</br>Great Liberty!  how great in plain attire!</br>With the base purple of a court oppress'd,</br>Bowing her head, and ready to expire:</br>But let me see thee stoop from heaven on wings</br>That fill the skies with silver glitterings!", "And as, in sparkling majesty, a star</br>Gilds the bright summit of some gloomy cloud;</br>Brightening the half veil'd face of heaven afar:</br>So, when dark thoughts my boding spirit shroud,</br>Sweet Hope, celestial influence round me shed,</br>Waving thy silver pinions o'er my head.</br>"]
