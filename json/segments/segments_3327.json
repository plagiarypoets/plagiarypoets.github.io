["Beneath the shelter of a mighty hill,</br>Whose marble peaks were garlanded with vine,</br>And musical with many a sunny rill,</br>That through its purple-clustered shades did twine,</br>Bright on a summer serpent's golden spine,</br>Leaned a low temple, in the sweet, grey gloom,</br>Hoary with moss, like Age in calm decline.</br>With, here and there, a rose's lingering bloom,</br>Wreathed loving round its brow &mdash; that temple is a tomb!", "There sleeps the Mantuan!  There the subtlest hand</br>That ever wakened passion's lyre, is laid.</br>Oh!  Master-genius of thy glorious Land!</br>When &mdash; when shall Italy her tresses braid</br>With the bright flowers, that round thy forehead played?</br>When flash to Heaven the ancient sword of Rome?</br>Come from thy rest, and call her Mighty shade!</br>No!  Vice, the worm, has fed upon her bloom!</br>Look not upon the slave; Sleep, Virgil, in thy tomb!</br>"]
