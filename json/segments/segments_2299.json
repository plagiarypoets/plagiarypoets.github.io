["See from her secret cell, with changeful vest,</br>And purple blush, approach returning day.</br>With gentle smiles her youthful brow is drest,</br>And as she moves upon the sunny ray,</br>In sportive wreaths her glowing ringlets play;</br>Then coy, and veil'd, her parting vigil keeps,</br>Or bathes her forehead in the Ocean spray;</br>Then closely wrapt in twilights' mantle, sleeps,</br>Wakes at the call of morn, and as she rises, weeps.", "Night changes too; tho' like a mourner clad,</br>In sable suit, she passes o'er the scene,</br>Her eye is dark, tho' not forever sad,</br>But sparkles when the mild, majestic queen</br>Moves from her palace with a step serene;</br>And o'er her robe a tinge of silver spreads,</br>And tipp'd with rays, her ebon wand is seen,</br>While her attendant stars decline their heads,</br>Wait for her sceptred nod, and tremble as she treads.", "The graceful year in every garb appears,</br>First, sad and lonely, wrapt in chilling showers;</br>And then a bashful child with artless fears,</br>Next as a blooming maiden crown'd with flowers;</br>Now like a matron lulls the infant hours,</br>With softest tones, of sweet melodious chime,</br>Then weak and hoary with enfeebled powers,</br>And bent beneath the heavy hand of time,</br>And last with magic strange, renews her youthful prime.", "Whether the circling year with glowing locks,</br>Or infant smiles, or weary step should rove,</br>Or dark with storms that rend the solid rocks,</br>Or cloth'd in rays that gild the nodding grove,</br>Or in her rapid flight, rejoicing move,</br>Still to the mortal eye, each change is fair,</br>And still awakes the strain of grateful love,</br>From the meek soul that feels its Maker's care,</br>And sees Him in His works, and loves to praise Him there.</br>"]
