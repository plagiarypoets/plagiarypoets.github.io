["Arise, O Israel, know the Lord,</br>With flow'ry garlands strew the way;</br>A thousand victims, white and pure,</br>Upon the smoaking altars lay.</br>Profusely lavish all your store,</br>Confess the Godhead and adore:</br>With songs of praise your great Deliv'rer meet,</br>Unbounded as his love, and as his mercy sweet.", "When winds and waves in conflict join,</br>And long the wat'ry war sustain,</br>'Tis he, who, cloath'd with dreadful pow'r,</br>Asserts the empire of the main,</br>Whilst o'er the billows back he strides,</br>Or in the furious eddy rides;</br>Old ocean at his voice begins to roar,</br>Rolls his insulting waves, and proudly braves the shore.", "'Tis he the fatal shaft prepares,</br>Which does a guilty age controul;</br>His burst of thunder shakes the earth,</br>His subtle lightnings melt the soul;</br>The savage kind hear and obey;</br>And savage man, more fierce than they,</br>Whilst his red arm prepares the bolt to throw,</br>Flies from his wrath divine, and dreads th' impending blow.", "His anger gives to winds their wings,</br>Which with their breath the forest rend;</br>Tall cedars split beneath the blast,</br>Or like the humble oziers bend;</br>In vain the herds to covert fly,</br>In vain they shun the piercing eye;</br>Ev'n Libanus and Sirion, whilst they hear,</br>Start at his awful voice, and wonder why they fear.", "Happy Israel, chosen tribe!</br>With softer notes your hours beguile;</br>Tune ev'ry lyre to sing his praise,</br>Who makes the peaceful olive smile;</br>The happy fruit securely taste</br>Of glorious toils, and danger past.</br>HIs world shall cause destructive rage to cease,</br>And bind the jarring world in everlasting peace.</br>"]
