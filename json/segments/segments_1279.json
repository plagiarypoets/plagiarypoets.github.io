["The beating snow-clad bell, with sounding dead,</br>Hath clanked four &mdash; the woodman's wak'd again;</br>And, as he leaves his comfortable bed,</br>Dithers to view the rimy feather'd pane,</br>And shrugs, and wishes &mdash; but 'tis all in vain:</br>The bed's warm comforts he must now forego;</br>His family that oft till eight hath lain,</br>Without his labour's wage could not do so,</br>And glad to make them blest he shuffles through the snow.", "The early winter's morn is dark as pitch,</br>The wary wife from tinder brought at night,</br>With flint and steel, and many a sturdy twitch,</br>Sits up in bed to strike her man a light;</br>And as the candle shows the rapturous sight,</br>Aside his wife his rosy sleeping boy,</br>He smacks his lips with exquisite delight,</br>With all a father's feelings, father's joy,</br>Then bids his wife good-bye, and hies to his employ.", "His breakfast water-porridge, humble food;</br>A barley crust he in his wallet flings;</br>On this he toils and labours in the wood,</br>And chops his faggot, twists his band, and sings,</br>As happily as princes and as kings</br>With all their luxury: &mdash; and blest is he,</br>Can but the little which his labour brings</br>Make both ends meet, and from long debts keep free,</br>And neat and clean preserve his numerous family.", "Far o'er the dreary fields the woodland lies,</br>Rough is the journey which be daily goes;</br>The woolly clouds, that hang the frowning skies,</br>Keep winnowing down their drifting sleet and snows,</br>And thro' his doublet keen the north wind blows;</br>While hard as iron the cemented ground,</br>And smooth as glass the glibbed pool is froze;</br>His nailed boots with clenching tread rebound,</br>And dithering echo starts, and mocks the clamping sound.", "The woods how gloomy in a winter's morn!</br>The crows and ravens even cease to croak,</br>The little birds sit chittering on the thorn,</br>The pies scarce chatter when they leave the oak,</br>Startled from slumber by the woodman's stroke;</br>The milk-maid's song is drown'd in gloomy care,</br>And, while the village chimneys curl their smoke,</br>She milks, and blows, and hastens to be there;</br>And nature all seems sad, and dying in despair.", "The quirking rabbit scarcely leaves her hole,</br>But rolls in torpid slumbers all the day;</br>The fox is loth to 'gin a long patrole,</br>And scouts the woods, content with meaner prey;</br>The hare so frisking, timid once, and gay,</br>'Hind the dead thistle hurkles from the view,</br>Nor scarce is scar'd though in the traveller's way,</br>Though waffling curs and shepherd-dogs pursue;</br>So winter's rugged power affects all nature through.", "What different changes winter's frowns supply:</br>The clown no more a loitering hour beguiles,</br>Nor gaping tracks the clouds along the sky,</br>As when buds blossom, and the warm sun smiles,</br>And \"Lawrence wages bids\" on hills and stiles;</br>Banks, stiles, and flowers, and skies, no longer charm;</br>Deep drifting snow each summer-seat defiles;</br>With hasty blundering step and folded arm</br>He glad the stable seeks, his frost-nipt nose to warm.", "The shepherd haunts no more his spreading oak,</br>Nor on the sloping pond-head lies at lair;</br>The arbour he once wattled up is broke,</br>And left unworthy of his future care;</br>The ragged plundering stickers have been there,</br>And pilfers it away:  he passes by</br>His summer dwelling, desolate and bare,</br>And ne'er so much as turn a conscious eye,</br>But gladly seeks his fire, and shuns th' inclement sky.", "The scene is cloth'd in snow from morn till night,</br>The woodman's loth his chilly tools to seize:</br>The crows, unroosting as he comes in sight,</br>Shake down the feathery burden from the trees;</br>To look at things around he's fit to freeze:</br>Scar'd from her perch the fluttering pheasant flies;</br>His hat and doublet whiten by degrees,</br>He quakes, looks round, and pats his hands and sighs,</br>And wishes to himself that the warm sun would rise.", "The robin, tamest of the feather'd race,</br>Soon as he hears the woodman's sounding chops,</br>With ruddy bosom and a simple face</br>Around his old companion fearless hops,</br>And there for hours in pleas'd attention stops:</br>The woodman's heart is tender and humane,</br>And at his meals he many a crumble drops.</br>Thanks to thy generous feelings, gentle swain;</br>And what thy pity gives, shall not be given in vain.", "The woodman gladly views the closing day,</br>To see the sun drop down behind the wood,</br>Sinking in clouds deep blue or misty grey,</br>Round as a foot-ball and as red as blood:</br>The pleasing prospect does his heart much good,</br>Though 'tis not his such beauties to admire;</br>He hastes to fill his bags with billet-wood,</br>Well-pleas'd from the chill prospect to retire,</br>To seek his corner chair, and warm snug cottage fire.", "And soon as dusky even hovers round,</br>And the white frost 'gins crizzle pond and brook,</br>The little family are glimpsing round,</br>And from the door dart many a wistful look;</br>The supper's ready stewing on the hook:</br>And every foot that clampers down the street</br>Is for the coming father's step mistook;</br>O'erjoy'd are they when he their eyes does meet,</br>Bent 'neath his load, snow-clad, as white as any sheet.", "I think I see him seated in his chair,</br>Taking the bellows up the fire to blow;</br>I think I hear him joke and chatter there,</br>Telling his children news they wish to know;</br>With leather leggings on, that stops the snow,</br>And broad-brimm'd hat uncouthly shapen round:</br>Nor would he, I'll be bound, if it were so,</br>Give twopence for the chance, could it be found,</br>At that same hour to be the king of England crown'd.", "The woodman smokes, the brats in mirth and glee,</br>And artless prattle, even's hours beguile,</br>While love's last pledge runs scrambling up his knee,</br>The nightly comfort from his weary toil,</br>His chuff cheeks dimpling in a fondling smile;</br>He claims his kiss, and says his scraps of prayer,</br>Begging his daddy's pretty song the while,</br>Playing with his jacket-buttons and his hair;&mdash;</br>And thus in wedlock's joys the labourer drowns his care.", "And as most labourers knowingly pretend</br>By certain signs to judge the weather right,</br>As oft from \"Noah's ark\" great floods descend,</br>And \"buried moons\" foretel great storms at night,</br>In such-like things the woodman took delight;</br>And ere he went to bed would always ken</br>Whether the sky was gloom'd or stars shone bright,</br>Then went to comfort's arms till morn, and then</br>As cheery as the sun resum'd his toils agen.", "And ere he slept be always breath'd a prayer,</br>\"I thank thee, Lord, that thou to-day didst give</br>Sufficient strength to toil; and bless thy care,</br>And thank thee still for what I may receive:</br>And, O Almighty God!  while I still live,</br>Ere my eyes open on the last day's sun,</br>Prepare thou me this wicked world to leave,</br>And fit my passage ere my race is run;</br>'Tis all I beg, O Lord!  thy heavenly will be done.\"", "Holland!  to thee this humble ballad's sent,</br>Who for the poor man's welfare oft hast pray'd;</br>Whose tongue did ne'er belie its good intent,</br>Preacher, as well in practice, as in trade&mdash;</br>Alas, too often money's business made!</br>O may the wretch, that's still in darkness living,</br>The Bible's comforts hear by thee display'd;</br>And many a woodman's family, forgiven,</br>Have cause for blessing thee that led their way to heaven.</br>"]
