["Your Poet most saucily writes,</br>On subjects he can't understand,</br>And talks of the \"Village delights,\"</br>Up three pair of stairs in the Strand.", "He sings of the sweet gentle zephyrs,</br>So charming to those who an't near 'em,</br>Lambs bleating, and mild lowing heifers,</br>So pleasant to those who don't hear 'em.", "Of shepherds as true as the Sun,</br>Of damsels as chaste as the moon;</br>If the Poet means aught but his fun,</br>I'll tell him another tale soon.", "His zephyrs I cannot espouse,</br>For often my corn they will parch;</br>And I know that the roof of my house</br>Was most sweetly blown off in the last March.", "The cow, in my yard, which I keep,</br>All night does her calf so bemoan,</br>That I can't get a wink of good sleep,</br>Though I'm weary and lying alone.", "Of nymphs, and of swains, what they say,</br>I never could read but I smil'd,</br>For my shepherd's &mdash; at Botany Bay,</br>And my dairy-maid's always with child.</br>"]
