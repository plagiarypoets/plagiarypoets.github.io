["And art thou here again, truth-telling day!</br>That sent me forth to take my fill of earth;</br>To pass, as others pass, from grave to gay,</br>And bear my part in mourning or in mirth?</br>Come, pause awhile, and give me time to know</br>If I may bid thee speed, and gaily let thee go.", "Thou art no day of mirth, &mdash; though early taught</br>To hail thy coming as the hour for joy,</br>Years scarce can check that childishness of thought,</br>And teach the man no more to be a boy.&mdash;</br>Thou art no day of mirth, &mdash; for with thee come</br>Thoughts, grave and high to all &mdash; piercing and keen to some.", "Thou art no flatterer! &mdash; faithless friends there be,</br>Specious and gay, of promise insincere,&mdash;</br>But on thine honest front at once I see</br>Thou comest to bring plain tidings to my ear;</br>And I shall not outlive thee, &mdash; thou wilt be</br>Fix'd faithful to my fate, and pass away with me!", "Then tell thy tale uncheck'd, while life moves on:</br>And louder yet, and louder be the call!</br>But, should it sound too often and too long,</br>Till on a deaden'd ear its warnings fall,</br>Then may'st thou cease to speak, as I to hear,</br>And both in silence sleep, till better days appear!</br>"]
