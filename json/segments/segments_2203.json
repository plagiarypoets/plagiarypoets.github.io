["On the side of a murmuring stream,</br>As lately I laid myself down,</br>Ye Shepherds, I chose for my theme,</br>To mark how the waters did run.", "So sweetly they seem'd for to play,</br>And bubbled, and bubbled along,</br>I said, pretty stream!  play away,</br>And charm me again with thy song.", "The pebbles, so neat, and so clean,</br>So handsomely spread on the ground,</br>Did also contribute, I ween,</br>To send forth a musical sound.", "Ah!  murmur, still murmur, says I,</br>And up I arose on my feet;&mdash;</br>But being, ye Shepherds, too nigh,</br>My stockings and shoes they were wet.", "Then home to my cottage I'll go,</br>And, tho' there no reason be why,</br>I'll give up myself to my woe,</br>And when my time comes &mdash; I will die!</br>"]
