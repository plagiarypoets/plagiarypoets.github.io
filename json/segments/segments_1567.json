["Heard ye the shepherd's legendary tale,</br>Under old Mole, in soft Armulla's dale?</br>Saw ye the villagers around him throng,</br>Attentive still to hear his rustic song,</br>And Mulla, list'ning, stop her native speed,</br>To catch the sound of harmless Colin's reed?</br>Kilcolman's woods with Colin's carrols ring;</br>Kilcolman's ruins sad remembrance bring.</br>Ill-fated swain!  what boots it to have sung</br>Of knights, of dames, of halls with trophies hung,</br>Of tournaments and necromantic pow'rs,</br>And damsels sleeping in enchanted bow'rs,</br>Fays, giants, goblins, dwarfs of horrid mien,</br>And all the glories of thy Fairy Queen!</br>Slow chilling penury, the poet's fate,</br>And disappointment, on thy evening wait,</br>Hope for the morrow; evil for the day;</br>To stoop to those who smile but to betray,</br>To know of sad dependence all the fears,</br>To court the bounty of reluctant peers;</br>From barb'rous spoilers not a remnant save,</br>Worn down with cares, to sink into the grave&mdash;</br>Such were the suff'rings of Eliza's bard;</br>This, Poesy exalted, thy reward!", "Flow, Mulla, flow; though Colin be no more;</br>Though Colin's friend reluctant leave thy shore</br>To court new smiles, and give his youthful sail</br>To all the dangers of Ambition's gale;</br>Yet shall the Muse, sure harbinger of fame,</br>Give to remembrance injur'd Raleigh's name,</br>Bid the fond mother tell her infant brood,</br>When wean'd, they banquet on Columbia's food,</br>\"This, Raleigh planted.\"  If he proudly calls</br>England's best bulwark, England's wooden walls;</br>When new defence, new conquest Britain plans,</br>Her wooden walls, thus nurtur'd, Erin mans.", "Sweet Mulla flow; and, as thy waters glide,</br>Increase, dilate, till Bregrog's widow'd bride</br>Shall, join'd to Avenmore's commanding flood</br>At Youghal, overwhelm full many an ancient wood. . . .</br>"]
