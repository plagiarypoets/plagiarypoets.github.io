["Say, who are these that tread the darken'd scene,</br>With cautious step and deeply thoughtful air?</br>No crested helmet shades their lofty mien,</br>No angry dart, or warring sword, they bear,</br>And though their glance is bold, their brows are mark'd with care.", "Around their locks a half-form'd wreath is thrown,</br>Whose fading leaves, the deepning gloom increase,</br>Twin'd from a plant, now exil'd and unknown,</br>For whose return the prayer shall never cease,</br>The sacred olive fair, that marks the men of peace.", "Tho' prompt to ward the near impending stroke,</br>And guard of freedom's stream the vital source,</br>They tempt no conflict, no revenge provoke,</br>But meet oppression in its daring course,</br>With wisdom's ample shield, of Heaven attemper'd force.", "Ye sages firm!  in dark and troubled times,</br>To you, in accents sad, your country sighs,</br>In days of discord, violence, and crimes,</br>Her guardians, and her friends, she sees you rise,</br>Like ancient heroes bold, as humble Christians wise.", "She sees no party views your aspects shroud,</br>No rash resolves your steady course pervert,</br>And points you high above the arching cloud,</br>Where round the throne of Him who knows the heart,</br>Bright watchful seraphs stand, and mark your arduous part.", "Ye sages just!  the record of these days,</br>Shall beam afar beyond your last abode,</br>What now your counsels, or your hands, shall raise,</br>The sword, the shield, the balance, or the rod,</br>Will rise before your souls in the dread day of God.", "For you the secret prayer to Heaven ascends,</br>To Heaven for you, assembled hosts implore,</br>When to the earth the contrite spirit bends,</br>Or saints the tears of pure devotion pour,</br>Your names escape their lips, while they their God adore.</br>"]
