["PROVENCE! &mdash; by every heart remember'd long,</br>Scene of the Hero's fame, and Lover's lay;</br>Where erst thy Troubadours awoke the song</br>With some wild legend, and forgotten fray,</br>Or made the festal moment yet more gay,</br>When labour's duties had with evening ceas'd;</br>Caroll'd their ballads to the closing day,</br>To hail the swain's return from toil released,</br>Or strung their tuneful harps, to greet the vintage feast.", "In hall or bower their melodies were sung,</br>Through each dark waving wood and cultured plain;</br>Thine olive vallies with their sonnets rung,</br>And every echo gave the notes again.</br>Romance, and song, and love-tales' glowing strain</br>Breathed their soft cadence on the blue Rhone's shore;</br>And dear to high-born Lord, and peasant swain,</br>Were Music's wandering bards in days of yore,</br>When welcome ever hail'd the lowly Troubadour.", "On the bright margin of the swift Durance,</br>What time the star-fires shot through twilight's gloom;</br>They sang the knightly chivalry of France,</br>Her fruitful vineyards, and her gardens' bloom.</br>Hymn'd the sad requiem to that hapless doom,</br>Which join'd in death the lovers of Vauclose!</br>Twining grief's minstrel garlands round their tomb,</br>Where many an holy tear its shrine bedews,</br>And Eloisa's fate is mourn'd by every Muse.", "Lov'd Land, farewell! &mdash; nor blame me for the wrong</br>Thy charms have suffer'd from this idle rhime;</br>Though an all-feeble Minstrel weaves the song,</br>That tells strange legends of thine earlier time,</br>When feudal power was stain'd with feudal crime,</br>And e'en thy flowery paths were track'd with blood;</br>Deeds all unmeet for such celestial clime,</br>Whose beauties live alike in field and flood,&mdash;</br>On sky-capt mountain's height, and mulberry shaded wood.", "Land of Romance! &mdash; a last, a long adieu!</br>Thy scenes are fading from my sight away,</br>Nor dare my skilless touch their themes renew,</br>While on the breeze my fitful notes decay,</br>As sinks the western sunbeam's golden ray,</br>To veil its glories in the ocean's swell;</br>E'en with that rude breeze dies my ruder lay,</br>Awaking Fancy bursts her fairy spell,</br>And the Muse bids her own romantic land &mdash; Farewell!</br>"]
