["Say, Goddess, wilt thou never smile</br>Indulgent on Britannia's Isle!</br>Hither thy gentle Footsteps bend,</br>On Albion's Sea-girt Cliffs descend;</br>O come, and with thy genial Ray</br>Chase ev'ry gloomy Cloud away:</br>No more shall Ignorance preside,</br>Or Gothic Rage in Triumph ride.</br>Let Judgment, thy unshaken Friend,</br>With polish'd Elegance attend:</br>Simplicity, meek rural Queen,</br>With downcast Looks and modest Mien,</br>In loosely-flowing neat Attire,</br>Shall charm thee with her rustic Lyre.</br>To that in her enchanting Court</br>The Frolic Graces ever sport,</br>And guarded by their watchful Aid,</br>The finer Arts shall never fade.", "Blest Pow'r!  whose Charms alone dispense</br>A keener Rapture to each Sense:</br>If Melody enchant my

Vigour give;</br>May you restrain each Poet's Rage,</br>Or animate his purer Page.</br>Do'st thou his savage Wrath appease,</br>Ev'n Terror's Giant-Form can please;</br>'Mid shadowy Shapes in Dead of Night,</br>That shoot a-cross my dazzled Sight;</br>'Mid Spectres of enormous Size,</br>'Mid Ghosts that from their Charnels rise,</br>'Mid shrouded Friends who solemn stalk,</br>And haunt me in my Midnight Walk;</br>While Wild-Winds blust'ring round my Head,</br>Inspire me with Poetic Dread;</br>Thro' closing Shades o'er Valleys green,</br>May'st thou still solemnize the Scene;</br>And as the Storms innoxious roll,</br>Pour thy lov'd Horrors o'er my Soul.", "Yet not alone Britannia's Shore</br>Thy fatal Absence shall deplore.</br>See old Achaia's Genius mourn,</br>His Bosom bare, his

the Arts began to spread</br>Once more gay Science rear'd her Head:</br>Alas!  in vain she strove to assuage</br>The Enthusiast Zealot's bigot Rage.</br>Wilt thou, O Taste, again appear,</br>Protectress of each circling Year!</br>Wilt thou in all thy wonted Prime</br>Review this lost unhallow'd Clime;</br>Or here far distant Regions lie,</br>'Mid dreary Desarts bloom and die!</br>Say, shall the stern Olympian God</br>No more in living Marble nod!</br>Shall never Raphael charm the Heart,</br>Shall never Nature yield to Art,</br>Shall never Maro's Beauties shine,</br>Except in Armstrong's Classic Line!</br>And does no Leo now remain,</br>Who yet shall chear thy drooping tTain!</br>There are, who still thy Aid implore,</br>Who still thy sov'reign Po'er

circling Waves:</br>Where boundless Oroonoko fills</br>His Channels from a thousand Hills,</br>And with regardless Rage destroys;</br>While twenty Mouths with hideous Noise,</br>From some immense
