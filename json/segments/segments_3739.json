["When potent Henry o'er this sea-girt Isle</br>The sceptre sway'd, and rul'd with iron rod,</br>The Monarch's self was held in thraldom vile;</br>He bow'd his head to Rome's imperial nod.</br>The School-man's weapon he assum'd,</br>His crest 'gainst Luther too he plum'd,</br>The sacred HIERARCHY of ROME maintain'd;</br>The FAITH'S DEFENDER, thus was six wiv'd Henry nam'd.", "The triple-crown'd LEO, he who bore</br>The Trident of the BABYLONISH WHORE,</br>Smil'd at the Royal Pedant, and by the Bull,</br>The sacred title authoriz'd in full.</br>When lo!  across the Monarch came,</br>Ann's beauteous lightning &mdash; and the flame</br>Shot from her magic-glancing eyes,</br>The Monarch caught with wild surprize:</br>The sacred bonds with Catherine he broke,</br>And spurn'd at Clement's Bull and iron yoke.", "Then, trampling on the laws of God, he rose</br>HEAD of the CHURCH, and curs'd, and damn'd her foes.</br>The Holy Monast'ry no more</br>To pious Monks unlocks her door;</br>The shrines all fall &mdash; the altars shake;</br>Rome's pillars tremble &mdash; Priests all quake.</br>Astonish'd EUROPE saw the Monarch's plan,</br>Abhor the tyrant, yet applaud the man.", "While on his throne elate, he sat and smil'd,</br>God's Vicar humbl'd, in his plans beguil'd,</br>One impious hand the tables broke</br>Of God &mdash; the other broke the yoke</br>Of Rome's imperial lawless lord;</br>While Henry, hated and abhorr'd,</br>Threw off the mask &mdash; and shew'd the mighty farce,</br>Bid EUROPE, POPES, PRIESTS, ALL kiss his &mdash;.</br>"]
