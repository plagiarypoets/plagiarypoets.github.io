["When Homer begg'd his way from door to door,</br>The base neglect his genius proudly bore;</br>With glance prophetic, though of sight bereft,</br>The sublunary world indignant left;</br>Anticipated Fame with sure demand,</br>And plac'd on Time's award his glowing hand.</br>When o'er the harp his magic language flew,</br>The dead awaken'd, and immortal, grew.</br>The Denizen of Nature's genial clime</br>To every age was present and sublime.", "Enchanting Spenser plum'd his Fairy-wing,</br>Though Famine pinch'd him with her venom'd sting:</br>Pathetic Otway sigh'd in vain for bread,</br>Kill'd by the morsel that his hunger fed;</br>The hapless Forger died of human scorn,</br>To Inspiration's deathless honours born:</br>Though Plato's mantle was on Sydenham cast,</br>The Debtor was in chains, and breath'd his last;</br>Compassion, Taste, and Genius, rung his knell;</br>The tears of Science on his ashes fell.</br>Deploring him with provident regret,</br>You thought of other Sydenhams lingering yet;</br>With gentle voice the panting spirit cheer'd,</br>And for the Pilgrim's feet this temple rear'd;</br>If Genius owns him by the world oppress'd,</br>Encouragement is here, as well as rest:</br>His bright conceptions to the age are shewn,</br>His feelings cherish'd, and his virtues known.</br>"]
