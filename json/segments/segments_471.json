["I.</br>O Thou, the Friend of Man assign'd,</br>With balmy Hands his Wounds to bind,</br>And charm his frantic Woe:</br>When first Distress with Dagger keen</br>Broke forth to waste his destin'd Scene,</br>His wild unsated foe!", "II.</br>By Pella's Bard, a magic Name,</br>By all the Griefs his Thought could frame,</br>Receive my humble Rite:</br>Long, Pity, let the Nations view</br>Thy sky-worn Robes of tend'rest Blue,</br>And Eyes of dewy Light!", "III.</br>But wherefore need I wander wide</br>To old Ilissus' distant Side,</br>Deserted Stream, and mute?</br>Wild Arun too has heard thy Strains,</br>And Echo, 'midst my native Plains,</br>Been soothed by Pity's Lute.", "IV.</br>There first the Wren thy Myrtles shed</br>On gentlest Otway's infant Head,</br>To Him thy Cell was shown;</br>And while he sung the Female Heart,</br>With Youth's soft notes unspoiled by Art,</br>Thy Turtles mix'd their own.", "V.</br>Come, Pity, come, by Fancy's aid,</br>Even now my Thoughts, relenting Maid,</br>Thy Temple's Pride design:</br>Its Southern Site, its Truth compleat</br>Shall raise a wild Enthusiast Heat,</br>In all who view the Shrine.", "VI.</br>There Picture's Toils shall well relate</br>How Chance, or hard involving Fate,</br>O'er mortal Bliss prevail:</br>The Buskin'd Muse shall near her stand,</br>And sighing prompt her tender Hand</br>With each disastrous Tale.", "VII.</br>There let me oft, retir'd by Day,</br>In Dreams of Passion melt away,</br>Allow'd with Thee to dwell:</br>There waste the mournful Lamp of Night,</br>Till, Virgin, thou again delight</br>To hear a British Shell!</br>"]
