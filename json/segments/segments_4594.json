["Ere Morn illumes with rosy beams</br>Our plains, I wake the echoes round,</br>And tire the woods, and vales, and streams,</br>With many a love-complaining sound:</br>While still to ease my heart's consuming pain</br>Echoes, and woods, and vales, and streams, alas!  are vain.", "On flowery banks, where oaks arise</br>In shade, no more I find repose;</br>I sigh, the ring-dove answering sighs,</br>Tears swell the stream that murming flows;</br>But, ah!  to ease my heart's consuming pain,</br>Streams, woods, and vales, and echoes, all are vain.</br>"]
