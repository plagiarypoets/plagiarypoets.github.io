["I stood upon a hill, and saw a town</br>Shrouded with smoke in the fair vale below,</br>Chequering the fields with spots of dusky brown,</br>Whilst here and there the busy furnace' glow</br>Sent sooty vaporous volumes up in middle air,</br>To tell that \"hundred-handed\" steam was working there.", "And ever with the rush of fitful wind</br>Came the loud roll of wains; the din of men,</br>The tumult of the crowd of human kind,</br>Swelled in the gust; till silence fell again</br>When the wind's restless agency at length was still,</br>Or fainter breezes fail'd to reach my distant hill.", "The scene was fair; the sunshine glittering bright</br>Had gilded all that city, and from tower,</br>House top, and steeple, many a glancing light</br>Shot gaily in the summer's mid-noon hour&mdash;</br>When, sauntering listlessly, I left my resting place</br>To seek awhile that crowded borough's ample space.", "And then the illusion vanished as a dream!</br>No sounds of honest industry were there,</br>But oath and ribaldry, and curse and scream,</br>And sordid insolence with ruffian stare,</br>With all the evil passions which keep state</br>And flourish most where men most congregate.", "And slaves were many, though the land was free,</br>Slaves, &mdash; where the whirling engines' giddy roar</br>Proclaims where art and ceaseless industry</br>Add ever to the wealthy merchant's store;</br>But where a wretched race, in infancy, begin</br>A foul apprenticeship to malady and sin.", "I turned away; I could not bear to see</br>Society and commerce, wealth and power,</br>Each add a sting to human misery;</br>Each dull the sunshine of \"man's little hour.\"</br>Alas!  how well they point the moral of that theme</br>Which calls the life of man a short and painful dream!</br>"]
