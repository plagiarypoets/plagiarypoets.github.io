["How cheerful the birds on the spray,</br>How jocund throughout the cool grove,</br>How joyful and happy are they,</br>While the charms of dear freedom they prove;</br>But when caught and confin'd to a cage,</br>No longer they charm with their song;</br>'Till tenderness softens their rage,</br>From the fair-one to whom they belong.", "'Tis thus with the youths of the plains,</br>Thro' the paths of gay pleasure they rove;</br>'Till beauty o'er them throws her chains,</br>And they soon become captives to love:</br>Awhile they may strive hard to break</br>Their bondage, and wish to be free;</br>But finding their efforts too weak,</br>Contentedly lose liberty.", "Then use with discretion, ye fair,</br>The power to you o'er man given;</br>The hearts of the worthy take care</br>To preserve as a present from heaven:</br>Lay the care of your person aside,</br>From that but small comfort you'll find;</br>Make Prudence and Virtue your guide,</br>And strive to embellish your mind.</br>"]
