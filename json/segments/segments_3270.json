["Hence to some Convent's gloomy Isles,</br>Where chearful Daylight never smiles,</br>Tyrant, from Alibon haste, to slavish Rome;</br>There by dim Tapers' livid Light,</br>At the still solemn Hours of Night,</br>In pensive musings walk o'er many a sounding Tomb.", "Thy clanking Chains, thy crimson Steel,</br>Thy venom'd Darts, and barbarous Wheel,</br>Malignant Fiend, bear from this Isle away,</br>Nor dare in Error's Fetters bind</br>One active, freeborn, British Mind,</br>That strongly strives to spring indignant from thy Sway.", "Thou bad'st grim Moloch's fawning Priest</br>Snatch screaming Infants from the Breast,</br>Regardless of the frantick Mother's Woes;</br>Thou led'st the ruthless son of Spain</br>To wond'ring India's golden Plain,</br>From Deluges of Blood where tenfold Harvests rose.", "But lo!  how swiftly art thou fled,</br>When REASON lifts his radiant Head;</br>When his resounding, awful Voice they hear,</br>Blind Ignorance, thy doating Sire,</br>Thy Daughter, trembling Fear, retire;</br>And all thy ghastly Train of Terrors disappear.", "So by the Magi hail'd from far,</br>When Phoebus mounts his early Car,</br>The shrieking Ghosts to their dark Charnels flock;</br>The full-gorg'd Wolves retreat, no more</br>The prowling Lionesses roar,</br>But hasten with their Prey to some deep-cavern'd Rock.</br>"]
