["Collect the earth and pile the stones on high;</br>Fear-comhraic's memory from oblivion save</br>Blow from your hills, ye winds that softly sigh,</br>And breathe your tenderest plaints o'er Muirnin's grave.</br>Yon rocky steep, o'erhung with waving wood,</br>Shades the calm dwelling of the peaceful dead;</br>Meantime, below, the ever-restless flood</br>With solemn murmur fluctuates near their bed:</br>Why sigh the woods, why do the sad waves roar?</br>Small cause have sighing woods, or sad waves to deplore.", "But thou hast cause, Diorma, lovely Fair,</br>Meek maiden of the breast of lucid snow!</br>Give to the winds thy flowing length of hair,</br>And on the breezes send thy warbled woe.</br>Thy lovers vanish'd like two beams of light,</br>Snatch'd from the heath by intervening storms;</br>Or like two stars that perish from the sight,</br>When the fierce northwind heaven's fair blue deforms.</br>Low in the dust the mighty pair is laid,</br>While o'er their reliques dear, mourns many a lovelorn maid.", "Fear-comhraic, thee a band of females weep,</br>The hills re-echoing to their mournful strains:</br>Muirnin, for thee their voice in tears they steep;</br>Muirnin, the chief of Erin's bloody plains.</br>Mine eyes Fear-comhraic shall behold no more</br>Pacing with nimble speed the mountain's side;</br>Or with amazement from the stormy shore,</br>View dauntless Muirnin stem the swelling tide.</br>Pour the sad song; the doleful tale relate;</br>That future eyes may read, and weep the heroes' fate.", "Diorma from illustrious Connaid sprung,</br>Connaid, the sovereign of a thousand shields:</br>Diorma shone amidst the virgin throng,</br>As reigns the lily fairest in the fields.</br>Fair rose her bosom as a fleecy cloud,</br>Fair as the white wave when the storm is high;</br>Like wreathed smoke her copious tresses flow'd,</br>Nor could the morning star eclipse her eye:</br>Between two clouds not comelier shews the moon,</br>Than from between thy locks thy face, Diorma, shone.", "A thousand heroes woo'd the maid in vain,</br>All offers, but Fear-comhraic's, she declin'd:</br>He lov'd the maid: &mdash; who could from love refrain?</br>Diorma was the flowre of womankind.</br>What terror would he shun if she were by,</br>His shield in danger and his strength in war?</br>Who dares, he cries, who dares this arm defy?</br>Who dares with me to combat for the Fair?</br>The beauteous prize who shall refuse to yield,</br>Hard must his helm be prov'd, and strong his iron shield.", "I claim Diorma, mighty Muirnin said,</br>Muirnin with thee will for the Fair contend;</br>My spear is strong, and keen my trusty blade,</br>And oft mine arm hath made the valiant bend.</br>Then rise, great Cormac's son, and leave behind</br>Thy native shore; leave Erin's blushing plain:</br>Unfurl the spreading canvass to the wind,</br>And guide thy vessel o'er the yielding main.</br>He comes; &mdash; like mist the whitening fails appear,</br>The bloody moon, his shield, and tall his ashen spear.", "Aoden came:  dark was his louring brow:</br>Arise, he cry'd, Diorma's Love, arise;</br>Fight, fight, or yield Diorma to the foe:&mdash;</br>He rose, like clouds amidst autumnal skies:</br>Muirnin, thy limbs are large, thy stature high,</br>Thine arm is sinewy, and thy cheeks are fair:</br>But pause awhile. &mdash; Send round the shell of joy,</br>The deer swift-footed slay, the feast prepare:</br>Three days in glad festivity we spend,</br>And on the fourth, for Her, the lovely prize, contend.", "Persuade me not to sheath the shining blade;</br>Hither to fight Comhseadan's son I came:</br>Yield, son of battle, yield the lovely maid,</br>And o'er the heights of Erin raise my fame.</br>Muirnin, can I resign so great a prize?</br>No:  let our prowess for the Fair be try'd.</br>If by thine arm Fear-comhraic haply dies,</br>Place in the tomb my bright sword by my side.</br>Here fight we, Muirnin, by the noisy brook;</br>Lift, lift thy trusty steel, and meditate the stroke.", "Fierce was the onset of the fatal fray,</br>From mail to mail Death, dreadful, seems to bound:</br>Their swords descend, their brazen helmets bray,</br>And sparkling shivers fly, and shields resound:</br>From rock to rock as some huge fragment flies,</br>So blows to blows with mutual force succeed;</br>Their nostrils pant, fire flashes from their eyes,</br>Desperate they leap, they thrust, they wound, they bleed.</br>Slow and more slow now Muirnin's blade descends;</br>He sinks, his armour rings, and low to earth he bends.", "Does Muirnin fall, the fearless and the brave,</br>Whom for their Chief a thousand warriours boast?</br>Stretch wide the fail, ascend the briny wave,</br>And waft the hero to his native coast.</br>On Erin's heights the virgin sigh is deep;</br>For thee I mourn; for thee laments a foe;</br>Rise, rise ye winds, and down the hilly steep</br>O'er Muirnin's grave in plaintive murmurs blow.</br>And thou, Diorma, for the youth deplore,</br>Seem like the sun in rain, and weep along the shore.", "Aodan saw the son of Cormac dead;</br>Then to revenge his fall his bow he bent;</br>The bow-string twang'd, the grey-wing'd arrow sped,</br>And in Fear-comhraic's heart its force was spent.</br>Where, gloomy youth, where was the sword of war,</br>Smiling in pain the bleeding warriour cries;</br>Where was the valour of thy conquering spear,</br>When by the treacherous shaft Fear-comhraic dies;</br>Raise thou our tombs beneath yon rocky steep,</br>There will I with the Chief of Innisfhallin sleep.&mdash;", "Ah!  who is she, her breasts like wreaths of snow,</br>Who like a still-beam in a storm appears?</br>'Tis Connaid's daughter, beautiful in woe;</br>Loose flow her locks; her blue eyes roll in tears:</br>Along the heath her liberal garments sail.</br>Daughter of grief, Diorma, pensive maid!</br>Thy lover lies, his youthful cheek all pale;</br>The steely prowess from his arm is fled.&mdash;</br>He fell, he vanish'd, as a stream of light;</br>Nor soothes thy voice his ear, nor charms thy smile his sight.</br>"]
