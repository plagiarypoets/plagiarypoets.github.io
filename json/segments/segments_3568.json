["Britons, no more your gen'rous Freedom boast,</br>Your in-born Virtue, and unbias'd Zeal;</br>With conscious Sorrow wail your Glories lost,</br>Your Laurels wither'd, and betray'd your Weal:</br>See, quick Destruction, with relentless Hand,</br>Hangs o'er the tott'ring State, and threatens all the Land.", "In simple Nature's unaffected Mien,</br>By Custom blinded, we no Charms descry;</br>While apish Fancy fills the shifting Scene</br>With Noise, and Pertness, and stiff Foppery:</br>Vain costly Pomp and riotous Excess</br>Crowns ev'ry cloying Board, and fashions ev'ry Dress.", "Think on the happy Times your Fathers saw,</br>(O never will those happy Times prevail?)</br>When Reason fram'd the necessary Law,</br>And rigid Justice poiz'd her equal Scale:</br>No fancy Faction fir'd the restless Crowd,</br>Nor Slaves to scepter'd Pow'r in base Submission bow'd.", "Degenerate Sons!  in vain our honest Sires</br>In glorious Charter seal'd with patriot Blood;</br>In vain &mdash; while sordid Interest conspires</br>T' oppress the Virtuous and betray the Good;</br>While selfish Av'rice taints th' ignoble Soul,</br>And venal Knaves drink deep Corruption's venom'd Bowl.</br>"]
