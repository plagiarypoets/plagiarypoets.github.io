["Ill-fated maid, in whose unhappy train</br>Chill poverty and misery are seen,</br>Anguish and discontent, the unhappy bane</br>Of life, and blackener of each brighter scene;</br>Why to thy votaries dost thou give to feel</br>So keenly all the scorns &mdash; the jeers of life?</br>Why not endow them to endure the strife</br>With apathy's invulnerable steel,</br>Or self-content and ease, each torturing wound to heal?", "Ah!  who would taste your self-deluding joys,</br>That lure the unwary to a wretched doom,</br>That bid fair views and flattering hopes arise,</br>Then hurl them headlong to a lasting tomb?</br>What is the charm which leads thy victims on</br>To persevere in paths that lead to woe?</br>What can induce them in that route to go,</br>In which innumerous before have gone,</br>And died in misery, poor and woe-begone?", "Yet can I ask what charms in thee are found?</br>I who have drank from thine ethereal rill,</br>And tasted all the pleasures that abound</br>Upon Parnassus', lov'd Aonian hill?</br>I, thro' whose soul the muses' strains aye thrill!</br>Oh!  I do feel the spell with which I'm tied;</br>And tho' our annals fearful stories tell,</br>How Savage languish'd, and how Otway died,</br>Yet must I persevere let whate'er will betide.</br>"]
