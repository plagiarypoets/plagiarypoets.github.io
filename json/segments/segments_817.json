["'Twas at the solemn hour when ghosts repair</br>To earth, and glide along the midnight air;</br>When all was hush'd, except a bell, whose toll</br>Rung the sad knell of some departing soul;</br>Musing I lay on life's uncertain date,</br>And the vain glories of this mortal state,</br>Then sunk to rest, but knew no calm repose</br>Still doom'd to scenes of visionary woes.", "Along those gloomy isles I seem'd to tread,</br>Where sleep entomb'd Britannia's mighty dead;</br>Sudden the distant, plaintive echoes found</br>From vaulted roofs, and hollow tombs around;</br>Near and more near, the doubling voices rise,</br>And gleaming tapers strike my wond'ring eyes:</br>At length an awful train appear'd in view,</br>All cloth'd in flowing vests of snowy hue;</br>Slow, solemn, sad, they trod, a tuneful throng,</br>And swell'd in lengthen'd notes the melancholy song;</br>While mournful sounds the organ's breath inspire</br>Responsive pealing to the pausing quire:</br>Stretch'd on a bier, in ermine robes array'd,</br>All pale in death, a form majestick laid;</br>With royal arms the pall embroider'd o'er,</br>Soft as they trod, the garter'd nobles bore,</br>At each slow step they drop'd a silent tear,</br>And sighing crowds of mourners clos'd the rear;</br>Methought as near the sad procession drew,</br>The marble urns all sweat a clammy dew,</br>Loud jar the brazen gates, the statues nod,</br>And awful tremblings rock the dread abode:</br>By time-worn vaults, and mansions of the dead,</br>Pensive I saw the weeping orders tread,</br>Then sigh'd, and woke; and now the morning came,</br>The morning big with melancholy fame,</br>Our flowing tears the general loss deplore,</br>The Friend, the Prince, the Patriot breathes no more.", "Weep, Britain, weep in agonizing woe,</br>And rend the laurel from thy mournful brow;</br>Lo, where in Death's encircling arms he lies;</br>With him thy pride, with him thy glory dies.</br>'Tis thus in vain to transient life we trust,</br>And each fair hope falls wither'd in the dust.</br>O, if to bear a mild, a generous heart,</br>To act each social, and each patriot part,</br>Fill ev'ry scene with dignity and ease,</br>In conscious merit ever sure to please;</br>To be whate'er the great, the good admire,</br>The faithful husband, and the tender sire;</br>Ardent to gain a nation's just applause,</br>And ever active in the publick cause;</br>If, Britons, these can claim the general tear,</br>Approach, and pour the grateful tribute here.", "Fate, be thy darts at vulgar bosoms hurl'd,</br>The shame, the refuse of a selfish world,</br>Mean souls, who feel no int'rest but their own,</br>Of wealth who bow before the golden throne,</br>Rich in the tears from orphans eyes that flow;</br>Great, and triumphant in a nation's woe:</br>But know, dread pow'r, fair virtue cannot die,</br>She scorns the earth, and seeks her parent skie;</br>Urns like their dead shall moulder into dust,</br>And time tread down the monumental bust,</br>The stars must fall, the heav'ns be wrap'd in fire,</br>And Death himself by his own shafts expire;</br>Crown'd with immortal youth shall virtue bloom,</br>Defy the stroke, and triumph o'er the tomb.", "Farewel, great Soul; O may thy shade be blest,</br>And seraphs waft thee to eternal rest.</br>Farewel, great Soul; till nature's second birth,</br>Secure we trust thy relicts to the earth;</br>There, 'till the trump shall rend th' astonish'd skies,</br>And with loud echoes bid the dead arise,</br>Sleep undisturb'd, amid that glorious train,</br>Whose honour'd bones yon hallow'd shrines contain,</br>The laurel'd bard, the philosophic sage,</br>Whoe'er delighted, or inform'd an age,</br>Warriors, who bled in freedom's glorious cause,</br>Patriots, whose counsels sav'd expiring laws,</br>Kings, whose good deeds still grateful nations tell,</br>Who liv'd belov'd like thee, like thee lamented fell.", "What tho' thy tomb no martial trophy boasts</br>For ravag'd nations, and for slaughter'd hosts;</br>What tho' no crouching captives frown in stone,</br>And bound beneath thy statue seem to groan;</br>Yet shall where'er thy peaceful ashes sleep,</br>The friends of Britain and of Freedom weep;</br>Each peaceful Virtue shall thy grave surround,</br>And musing Silence watch the holy ground;</br>There too the Muse her choicest wreaths shall bring,</br>There to thy soul her soothing requiem sing,</br>There to thy fame with gen'rous labour raise</br>The time-defying pyramid of praise.", "But, O!
