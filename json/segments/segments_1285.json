["For thy amusement first I tuned the lay,</br>And dress'd my thoughts in Spenser's antique style,</br>'Twas but a frolic task, a youthful play,</br>Whose best reward was thy approving smile.", "It scarcely claim'd th' offended critic's rod,</br>We love to imitate what we admire;</br>The Persian thus adores the Solar God,</br>And lights, faint emblem, his terrestrial fire.", "No longer inexperienced I presume</br>On fancied worth, beneath the quaint disquise,</br>But strip the veil, remove th' incumbent gloom,</br>And modern numbers give to modern eyes.</br>"]
