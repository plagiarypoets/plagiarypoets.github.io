["Yes, Phillis we'll trip o'er the Meads,</br>And hasten away to the Plain;</br>Where Shepherds attend with their Reeds,</br>To welcome my Love and her Swain.", "The Lark is exalted in Air,</br>The Linnet sings perch'd on the Spray;</br>Our Lambs stand in need of our Care,</br>Then let us not lengthen Delay.", "The Pleasure I feel with my Dear,</br>While gamesome young Lambs are at Sport,</br>Exceeds the Delight of a Peer,</br>That shines with such Grandeur at Court.", "When Collin and Strephon go by,</br>They form a Disguise for a while;</br>They see how I'm bless'd with a Sigh,</br>But Envy forbids them to smile.", "Let great Folks of Liberty prate,</br>T' enjoy it take infinite Pains;</br>But Liberty's primitive State</br>Is only enjoy'd on the Plains.", "With Phillis I rove to and fro,</br>With her my gay Minutes are spent;</br>'Twas Phillis first taught me to know</br>That Happiness flows from Content.</br>"]
