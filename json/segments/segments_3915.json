["Daughter of Penury, this way direct</br>Thy trembling step; bland Charity extends</br>Her ready hand to ease</br>Thy ponderous load of woe.", "Full well thy blood-stain'd eye, thy meagre cheek,</br>Where pinching hunger pines, thy palsied limbs,</br>Attest that simple truth</br>Speaks in thy plaintive tale.", "O garb unseemly for a day so rude!</br>No covering shields thy head from sinking snows,</br>Thy tatter'd cloak invites</br>The frolic of wild winds.", "The pointed flint, the jagged ice assault</br>Thy naked feet, ah naked feet that tread</br>Nor Pleasure's flowery path,</br>Nor sink in Luxury's down!", "Thy delicacy tyrant Want expell'd;</br>Coy modesty expir'd, when first thy voice</br>In firmer tone recall'd</br>The hastening passenger.", "Ye fair, who riot in indulgence!  cherish</br>Pity's soft tear, that starts to see this child</br>Of misery implore</br>Her sex's sister aid.</br>"]
