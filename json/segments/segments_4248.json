["Still does reluctant Sol refuse,</br>Courted by milk-maids, ah!  in vain,</br>To chase the damps, exhale the dews,</br>Heal influenza's madd'ning pain.</br>Must this auspicious day once more</br>Be clouded like these heretofore!</br>Shall show'rs impregnate with malignant air,</br>'Tis Galen's fondest wish, and Galen's gen'ral prayer.", "O yes!  in yonder pregnant sky,</br>Whence all our hopes, and bus'ness spring,</br>New barking patients drooping lie,</br>New fees in golden show'rs are on the wing,</br>The ling'ring morn that coyly sheds</br>On bursting clouds, and aching heads</br>At first a rainy day,</br>Now thicker, and now thinner pours</br>Wide, and more wide, the dreary showers,</br>Without one cheering ray.</br>And Earth bemoaning, in her hood-wink'd flight,</br>Dissolves in dreary damps, and live-long sleepless night.", "Satiate of tears, whose mad excess</br>No bound, no kind restriction knows,</br>Flood mark their progress with distress,</br>The half-drown'd lambkins want repose;</br>And poets waking from their dreams</br>Of golden showers, illusive schemes!</br>Shall build new castles in the air,</br>And hail, with raven-voice, the day that first is fair.</br>CAETERA DESUNT.</br>"]
