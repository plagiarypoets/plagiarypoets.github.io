["How oft have I tuned my reed</br>By the banks of this murmuring stream!</br>How oft! &mdash; but it sure is decreed</br>I should ever make Phillis my theme.</br>I will strive to forget her, I cry,</br>As I pensively wander alone;</br>Then in spite of myself heave a sigh:</br>&mdash;Sure pleasure and she are but one.", "Unfolded my sheep are by night,</br>As unheeded they ramble all day:</br>'Tis an age since she charmed my sight:</br>How heavily creeps time away!</br>But fancy will say she is here;</br>Then I wish to be talking of love:</br>Alas!  to offend is my fear;</br>And 'tis strange, but my tongue 'twill not move.", "Perhaps then some courage I take;</br>To the zephyrs I whisper my tale:</br>And thus do I dream when awake;</br>But will dreaming, oh Shepherd!  avail?</br>She sure must be tender, and kind,</br>Whose looks so much goodness impart:</br>She smil'd &mdash; but, alas!  I was blind,</br>Love had taken such root in my heart.", "She ne'er on so lowly a swain</br>Will a smile of compassion bestow;</br>But sure she will treat with disdain,</br>Or with coldness will pity my woe.</br>To say that sincere is my flame,</br>And that true to her beauties I'll prove;</br>Ah!  thousands may tell her the same;</br>For with her there's no feigning of love.", "By all that is lovely and fair,</br>By whatever I value or prize;</br>By the charms, oh my Phillis!  I swear,</br>And the language that flows from thine eyes,</br>Since the time that I viewed thy face,</br>No pleasure my shrubbery yields;</br>Both the rose and lilly seem base,</br>And unheeded the paint of the fields.", "My crook I have since thrown away,</br>My dog and his service forgot;</br>And my pipe &mdash; oh!  it serves but to play</br>When I'd fain be consoling my lot.</br>If to love thee, should favour obtain,</br>I love more than thou can'st believe;</br>And if pity should follow on pain,</br>Oh!  do not refuse to relieve.</br>"]
