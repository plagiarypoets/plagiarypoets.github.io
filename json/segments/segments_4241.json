["Ye fair ones, so pert and so gay,</br>Who trip in Mirth's frolicksome round,</br>Attend to DORINDA'S sad lay,</br>While her eyes in soft sorrow are drown'd.</br>Alas!  how demure she appears!</br>The smile no more brightens her face,</br>Her bosom's distracted with cares:</br>How artlessly pinn'd is her dress!", "Too late now, she cries, have I known</br>What it is to have been topapee,</br>My bloom of complexion is flown.&mdash;</br>To the aid of the rouge I must flee.</br>The fair, who from fashion retire,</br>In the tents of pure Nature may show,</br>But those whom in routs they admire,</br>From Art must exhibit their glow.", "Yet why do I feel thus the tears</br>So pensively water my cheek?</br>Tho' somewhat advancing in years,</br>The heart of fond Love I may break:</br>Some fool still may doat on my charms,</br>Tho' a wrinkle may somewhere be seen;</br>Thus the sun, tho' the twilight disarms,</br>Yet paints with sweet lustre the scene.", "When first at the age of fifteen</br>My glances I darted around,</br>Romantic!  I wish'd but to gain</br>A heart which sincerity crown'd:</br>But soon did I learn to my cost,</br>Her case is but wretchedly poor,</br>Who by her attractions can't boast</br>Half a dozen of raps at her door.", "Far wav'ring the heart of the fair,</br>From lover to lover should roll,</br>As pointing to one should appear,</br>Like the needle that marks to the pole;</br>But when by her carriage grown free,</br>His wishes believe her his own,</br>Should turn as the leaf of the tree</br>From the quarter the tempest is blown.</br>"]
