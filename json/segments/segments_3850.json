["What hardships must Damon endure!</br>What ills and what changes of fate!</br>Such griefs as no mortal can cure,</br>Nor Time's rueful hand e'er delete.</br>Once sported the swain void of care,</br>The deftest that dwelt on the plain;</br>He carrol'd his strains to the fair,</br>Their friendship and favour did gain.", "Each morn he arose at the dawn,</br>And drove his few sheep to the hill,</br>While careless they rov'd o'er the lawn.</br>No thought &mdash; but content did him fill;</br>Contentment he sung thro' the vale,</br>Practis'd in his cot what he sung,</br>The villager heard the sweet tale,</br>And blest his melodious tongue.", "They wonder'd a shepherd whose store</br>Was the smallest that graz'd on the mead,</br>Could Nature's deep secrets explore,</br>And all other shepherds exceed;</br>That one who was bred like a clown,</br>Could stars and their orbits describe,</br>The heavenly systems expound,</br>And all the aetherial tribe.", "But, alas!  how much chang'd is the scene;</br>Poor Damon no comfort can find;</br>No more pleasing thoughts him detain,</br>For fled is the peace of his mind.</br>His pleasure and joys are all gone,</br>He sighs &mdash; a disconsolate man!</br>He mourns his hard fate when alone,</br>Since contemn'd and despis'd by &mdash; Miss *****.</br>"]
