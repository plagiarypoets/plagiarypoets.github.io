["The trembling lyre I nicely, careful strung,</br>Then touch'd the chords, a tender mellow sound</br>Sprung up and cheer'd me; for a while it rung,</br>And echoed were its tunes from all around.</br>Back on my heart returned the thrilling sound,</br>A sudden, inward joy was there exprest,</br>And many a time it gladsome did rebound,</br>And as it bounded, rose and fell my breast,</br>Till ev'ry \"carking care\" seem'd slumber'd and at rest.", "And why the joy?  It sung of Friendship's pow'r,</br>Divine and holy, as the mother's kiss,</br>It brought to mind the happy, long-past hour</br>That I had spent, and spent in perfect bliss.</br>But ah!  how fickle, frail a world is this!</br>How soon our joys disperse, like loosen'd air</br>From strong compression; oh!  'tis then we miss</br>The joys which once but only tasted were,</br>That now make open way for dire and dark despair.", "Blest lyre!  oh!  let me touch thy chords again,</br>Oh!  let me bring to memory the past,</br>Oh!  let me ease the inward-working pain,</br>Nor think one moment of the dread contrast;</br>But light my mind, yes, e'en as summer blast</br>That waves and kisses ev'ry blooming flower,</br>Nor for a while let one dark shadow cast</br>Itself on me; or even near me low'r,</br>But let me happy be, for even one short hour.</br>"]
