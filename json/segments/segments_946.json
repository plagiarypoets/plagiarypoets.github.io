["Blessings on heavn's high king!  His word divine,</br>Which spoke chaotic darkness into light,</br>Great GEORGE'S mind to virtue's fairer shrine</br>Obedient call'd, and glory's arduous height:</br>His fost'ring care, beneath a distant sky,</br>A beauteous Virgin's purest soul refin'd,</br>Whose native worth with GEORGE'S own might vie,</br>A softer image of his manly mind:</br>Through ages then his blessings to convey,</br>He gave a royal babe to Albion and to Day.", "In that blest morn bright Virtue's hallow'd band</br>Gan jocund strains of melody to pour,</br>While Science, fix'd of thought, of ready hand,</br>With choicest honours mark'd the happy hour:</br>Religion, decent maid with silver zone,</br>Shot beams of chastest joy from either eye,</br>And Liberty, best guardian of the throne,</br>Exultant rais'd her cherub voice on high:</br>Meanwhile enrag'd Oppression gnaw'd his chain,</br>And Faction mourn'd for ever lost her revel reign.", "And lo!  with hasten'd step and pleasing mein</br>Fair Peace returns, with all her exile train,</br>To greet this infant prince; while heav'n's high queen,</br>Wisdom yclep'd, by whom earth's monarchs reign,</br>Her purpose speaks; the devious paths of youth</br>Beside, his ductile soul secure to lead</br>Thro' arduous ways of valour, justice, truth,</br>Up Science hill to virtue's noblest meed:</br>His bosom rouse to deeds of high emprize,</br>And now its youthful ardor praise, and now chastize.", "Thus form'd, Britannia's younger son shall tell</br>By deeds of high renown his royal birth,</br>While in his self-approving breast shall dwell</br>Confess'd his either parent's peerless worth.</br>So some fair scyon, rich in gen'rous blood</br>Of parent-stem, in wisely-chosen hour</br>Transplanted, and improv'd by genuine food</br>Of quick'ning heat, and vegetating show'r,</br>In earth's dank bosom strikes its fertile root,</br>And speaks its goodly origin by kindred fruit.", "Then when, mature in age, by heav'n's decree,</br>He takes the sceptre from his parent's hand,</br>Like him shall rule, by laws benign as free,</br>The prince and patron of a grateful land;</br>Like him, behold a manly offspring rise</br>Proclaim'd by deeds of kindred worth his own,</br>Then, full of years, affect his native skies;</br>Pleas'd in fair thought to new his righteous throne</br>Thro' latest ages in his line descend,</br>Nor Brunswic ever but with time and Britain end.</br>"]
