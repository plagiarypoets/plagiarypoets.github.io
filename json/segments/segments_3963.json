["Dear Shade &mdash; if injur'd Spirits wander near</br>The cold Couch where their Victim-forms recline,</br>Oh come at ev'nings twilight hour, and hear</br>And breathe thy last farewell to me on thine&mdash;</br>For here I sit and think at day's decline&mdash;</br>Thy early bloom &mdash; sweet hours &mdash; for ever gone&mdash;</br>So mild &mdash; so tender &mdash; e'er thou did'st resign</br>Thy whole heart up to Passion's thrill alone&mdash;</br>All lov'd and mourn thee, hapless youth, save one.", "And she was all to thee &mdash; till thou to her</br>Wert mock'ry's sport &mdash; so sad and so subdued&mdash;</br>As wanton winds the stealing lock bestir,</br>She took and toss'd thee from her bosom rude&mdash;</br>The reel of triumph met the eye that woo'd&mdash;</br>Ungentle Conqu'rer, when the prize was won,</br>To break the bruis'd reed! &mdash; 'twas then we view'd</br>Thy gentleness &mdash; thy reason &mdash; all undone&mdash;</br>All mourn &mdash; for all did love thee &mdash; all &mdash; save one!</br>"]
