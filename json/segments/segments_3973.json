["Waste not thy sweetness on \"the desert air,\"</br>Thou gentle maiden, with that pallid cheek;</br>Let hope replace the faded roses there,</br>And bid thine eyes their lost expression speak.</br>What!  though the youth has left thy love, to seek</br>A brighter charm, at wealth's unholy shrine,</br>Let not his falshood thy fond spirit break;</br>He was not unworthy such a heart as thine.</br>Let not thy fingers for the wand'rer twine</br>The cypress wreath, nor willow's bodeful green;</br>But let the garland in thy tresses shine</br>Fair as the hope in early visions seen,</br>When many gallant knee did low incline</br>Before the majesty of beauty's dazzling shrine.</br>"]
