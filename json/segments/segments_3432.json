["When Freedom, drest in blood-stain'd vest,</br>To ev'ry Knight her war song sung;</br>Upon her head wild weeds were spread,</br>A goary faulchion by her hung.</br>She danc'd on the heath;</br>She heard the voice of death;</br>Pale-ey'd Affright, his heart of silver hue,</br>In vain essay'd her bosom to assail;</br>She heard, unmov'd, the shrieking voice of woe,</br>And sadness, in the owlet, shade the dale.</br>She shook the pointed spear;</br>On high she held her shield,</br>The foe-men all appear,</br>And skim along the field.</br>Power, with his head exalted to the skies,</br>His spear a sun-beam, and his shield a star,</br>Like flaming meteors rolls his furious eyes,</br>Strikes with his iron feet, and sounds to war.</br>She sits upon a rock,</br>She bends before his spear,</br>She rises from the shock,</br>Wielding her own in air.</br>Hard as the thunder does she drives it on,</br>While veiled Prudence guides it to his crown;</br>His long, sharp spear, his spreading shield is gone,</br>He falls, the falling rolls ten thousands down.</br>War, gore fac'd War, by hideous Faction rous'd</br>His fiery helmet nodding to the air,</br>The bloody arrows in his straining hand.&mdash;</br>"]
