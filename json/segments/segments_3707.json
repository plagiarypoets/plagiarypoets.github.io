["Ye shepherds, while round me ye throng,</br>And vainly the hours beguile,</br>Ye cannot admire my song,</br>Nor I dare not repay you your toil.", "Philander, how fatal the day,</br>When ye led me to Damon's gay bower!</br>How careless, till then, did I stray,</br>New pleasures awak'd the young hours.", "Though ye sung me the carol of love,</br>Though ye wove me the garland so fine;</br>Though to praise me ye each of you strove,</br>And told me my form was divine;", "How fondly I boasted my heart</br>Could never be caught be your guile;</br>Too soon I experienc'd the smart,</br>And my Damon can cause me to smile.", "The linnet that sits on yon spray,</br>But yesterday flew to my breast;</br>There trembling and panting it lay,</br>It was robb'd of its young and its nest.", "Could I the sweet songster confine,</br>And heighten the pangs it endur'd,</br>Its sorrow I judg'd of by mine,</br>And its liberty quickly secur'd.", "This garland, so curiously wove,</br>Philander but yesterday gave;</br>Two turtles, sweet emblems of love,</br>And declar'd I his soul did enslave.", "Though he is the pride of the swains,</br>Tho' with fortune, with humour possess'd,</br>Tho' with rapture I hear his sweet strains,</br>And wish I could render him blest:", "Yet forbear to pursue me, fond youth,</br>Thy Delia more bliss shall impart;</br>She has honour, wit, beauty, and truth,</br>And you long have possess'd her fond heart.</br>"]
