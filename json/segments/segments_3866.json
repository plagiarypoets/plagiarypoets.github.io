["While o'er a parent's urn reclin'd,</br>And all on earth my soul holds dear,</br>Hap'ly to soothe the pensive mind,</br>The Muse forlorn still drops the tear:</br>She sees another year return,</br>Sighing, she hails th' important morn,</br>That claims the tribute of an annual lay,</br>And sings, in solemn strains, this new-born natal day.", "To notes of unavailing woe,</br>Long has she tun'd the broken lyre,</br>In vain &mdash; the numbers cease to flow,</br>That warm'd with true poetic fire:</br>Yet lonely at the midnight hour</br>Languid, she lov'd her plaint to pour;</br>Nor deem'd, a stranger to the sweets of joy,</br>That soon afflictive grief would youth's gay bloom destroy.", "Ah!  where these early scenes, she sung,</br>By fancy's vernal rays illum'd;</br>When flow'ry nature, sweet and young,</br>In all the pride of summer bloom'd?</br>'Twas then that lovely pleasure smil'd;</br>Then hope each vacant hour beguil'd,</br>Then were the tumults of my infant breast</br>By soft maternal fondness lull'd to rest.", "But mem'ry!  why these scenes pourtray,</br>That life's sweet mourning gave to view;</br>Why weep to see their tints decay,</br>To which I've bid a long adieu?</br>On other banks, by other streams,</br>Silver'd with Cynthia's ev'ning beams,</br>Tho' distant far from G&mdash;IE'S verdant plain,</br>The Muse shall often sit, and tune the solemn strain.", "No more the tender tears shall flow;</br>No more in solitude I mourn;</br>From the sad scenes of genuine woe,</br>To thee, FIDELE!  now I turn:</br>To thee the Muse directs her eye,</br>From these implores the friendly sigh;</br>While thus a stranger on this distant shore,</br>She hails her native fields, and much-lov'd friends, no more.", "Fair as the morn, the chearful smile,</br>That mantles o'er thy beauteous face,</br>Shall ev'ry tedious hour beguile,</br>And give my mind its wonted ease:</br>Sweet as the dew-besprinkled rose,</br>That with the summer's radiance glows,</br>Thy ev'ry grace, and ev'ry winning charm,</br>Shall chear the desart wild, and hush the rising storm.", "If yet thy soul to mine attun'd,</br>'Ere own'd compassion's friendly sway;</br>'Ere lov'd to heal affliction's wound,</br>And wipe the falling tear away;</br>What tho' we feel the hand of pain,</br>Nor earth's supremest bliss obtain,</br>Far other joys exalted and refin'd,</br>Far other bliss shall soothe the sympathetic mind.", "For here religion's sacred pow'r,</br>In virtue's snowy form array'd,</br>Shall brighten ev'ry future hour,</br>And gently lend her friendly aid;</br>While cheerful patience, modest fair!</br>Shall smoothe the wrinkled brow of care;</br>And meek-ey'd peace, with hope's transporting ray,</br>Shall calm the whirlwind's rage, and give eternal day.", "Here, fair FIDELE!  let us turn,</br>And worship at this radiant shrine;</br>With purest love our bosoms burn,</br>And own the mutual bliss divine&mdash;</br>For me who tunes the annual lay,</br>That celebrates this natal day,</br>As months, and rising years incessant roll,</br>Still may religion's joys support my grateful soul!", "And when the last sad hour is come,</br>That calls me from these scenes away,</br>FIDELE, o'er her poet's tomb,</br>The solemn rites shall duteous pay:</br>With friendship's fairest hand shall bring</br>The richest gifts of flow'ry spring;</br>And, while she kindly sheds the parting tear,</br>Shall strew them round his grave whom once she held so dear.</br>"]
