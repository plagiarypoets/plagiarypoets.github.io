["On well-fledg'd wing the muse ascends,</br>And glows with Inspiration's fire;</br>O'er earth a daring glance extends,</br>And boldly sweeps th' extatic lyre:</br>But not to paint the field of blood,</br>Where many a dauntless hero stood&mdash;</br>She leaves to other bards to tell</br>Who bravely fought, or nobly fell:</br>And, charm'd with virtues more serene,</br>Enraptur'd hovers o'er Britannia's Queen.", "When savage war awak'd surprize,</br>And many a dying groan was heard,</br>Her ear was open to our cries,&mdash;</br>Her prayer for white-rob'd Peace prefer'd</br>For well she knew what ills would spring</br>Beneath the shade of Discord's wing;</br>That want, with all her grisly train,</br>The mournful family of pain,</br>Would wake the hapless orphan's cry,</br>And dim with sorrow many a widow's eye.", "With sympathetic feelings fraught,</br>And mercy beaming from her mind,</br>And all that purity of thought,</br>Which stamps her best of woman-kind;</br>Full oft she hears the tales of woe,</br>Like streams, in murm'ring accents flow;</br>And o'er the great, the gallant dead,</br>The silver tear of pity shed;</br>And, prompt her country to relieve,</br>Implor'd that peace the wonted pow'r to give.", "Faction avaunt, with all thy schemes,</br>Thou parent of perpetual strife,&mdash;</br>That halcyon peace, with length'ning beams,</br>May gild the evening of her life;</br>And no prophetic fears destroy</br>Her mind's serene and settled joy;</br>But LOYALTY, each circling hour,</br>Exert her soul-combining pow'r,</br>And proudly tell to future days,</br>That Britain's Queen commands a Briton's praise.", "Whilst Anarchy, with lawless stride,</br>Stalk's o'er the wretched realm of France,</br>And Death and Plunder, side by side,</br>From Cots to Palaces advance,&mdash;</br>Let US, uniting firm the while,</br>To guard this highly-favour'd isle,</br>Spurn with contempt the LEV'LLER'S plan,</br>Engrafted on \"The Rights of Man,\"</br>And prove, in spite of all they've heard,</br>We boast a QUEEN BELOV'D &mdash; A KING REVER'D.</br>"]
