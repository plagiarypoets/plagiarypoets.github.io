["The earth, with AUTUMN'S precious fruits o'erspread,</br>Reflects the golden lustre of the morn;</br>The winding vale, and hill's exalted head,</br>Display their shining fields of ripen'd corn;</br>And in the fragrant orchard we behold</br>The sav'ry fruitage, ting'd with azure &mdash; purple &mdash; gold.", "How gracious is th' omniscient Lord of all,</br>Still mindful of his feeble creatures here;</br>His Providence directs the show'rs to fall,</br>And sun to shine &mdash; HE rules the varied year;</br>His bounty gives rich harvests to our Isle,</br>And all our comforts flow from his benignant smile.", "Abundant crops rejoice the farmer's heart,</br>And o'er the field the willing reapers toil;</br>Innate Simplicity, unknown to Art,</br>Adorns each blooming visage with a smile;</br>Alternate rest and labour pleasure give,</br>In rural innocence those useful rustics live.", "O, Agriculture!  Man's unfailing friend,</br>'Tis thine to cultivate the fertile ground;</br>The beautiful and useful thou dost blend,</br>And decorate sweet Nature's scenes around;</br>Without thee, famish'd cities, soon laid waste,</br>Would to oblivion sunk, by silent Time defac'd.", "Amid the plenitude of Nature's stores,</br>Which all that live on earth with food sustain,</br>The pious mortal Nature's GOD adores,</br>Who bless'd with rich increase the various grain&mdash;</br>Who all the changes of the seasons made,</br>And Plenty, in a robe of richest hues array'd.</br>"]
