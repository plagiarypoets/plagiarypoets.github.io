["Too long the fopperies of France,</br>O Britain, thy brave sons invade,</br>Shake off, at length, the shameful trance,</br>And leave the base inglorious shade.</br>How art thou fall'n, thou terror of thy foes!</br>Whose nod made tyrants just, and gave the world repose.", "Rouse thee to action; let the beau</br>Change for the helm his smart toupee,</br>With storms and cold familiar grow,</br>And brave the hoarse tempestuous sea:</br>For balls and operas, let him learn to bear</br>The gripes of want, and rough fatigues of war.", "Instead of snuff-box, take the spear;</br>And for a tender virgin's heart,</br>A nobler conquest let him share,</br>And bravely storm a Spanish fort:</br>Thro' slaughter'd heaps his bloody passage force,</br>And where the battle kindles urge his dangerous course.", "No more the ladies shall admire</br>The fop, who now enjoys their smiles;</br>But praise the hero's martial fire,</br>And with their love reward his toils;</br>Bless that brave man, to whom the Spaniards yield,</br>Triumphant, in the chamber, and the fields.", "What coward would not die with joy,</br>Whene'er his country claims his breath?</br>The trembling maid, the beardless boy,</br>Are snatch'd by unrelenting death:</br>In vain from war's alarms the fearful flies,</br>Swift it pursues, and by base wounds he dies.", "Britain ne'er doubted which to chuse,</br>A glorious death, or shameful life;</br>To stoop to her insulting foes,</br>Or perish in the noble strife;</br>Secure, however fortune smile, or frown,</br>Unsullied honours shall her labours crown.", "Great in herself, she scorns to rise,</br>By shameful stratagems; and hates</br>The vile deceitful policies</br>Which aggrandize the neighbouring states;</br>She smiles at all the vain designs they form,</br>And knows her thunder can disperse the storm.", "Of France's schemes no dread she knows,</br>Their cunning is not worth our care;</br>Let them declare themselves our foes,</br>And be (if possible) sincere.</br>Their frowns we laugh at, and despise th' ally</br>Who wears the mask of friendship to destroy.", "The thefts and insolence of Spain,</br>Too long the British lion bore,</br>Dreadful he shakes his shaggy main,</br>And nations tremble at his roar.</br>Tho' villains prosper, and revenge is slow,</br>Justice pursues, and will strike home the blow.</br>"]
