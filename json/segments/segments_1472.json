["Sleep, wayward thoughts, and rest you with my love.</br>Let not my love be with my love displeas'd:</br>Touch not, proud hands, lest you her anger move,</br>But pine you with my longings, long diseas'd.</br>Thus while she sleeps I sorrow for her sake;</br>So sleeps my love; and yet my love doth wake.", "But oh!  the fury of my restless fear!</br>The hidden anguish of my warm desires!</br>The glories and the beauties that appear</br>Between her brows near Cupid's closed fires!</br>Thus while she sleeps I languish for her sake;</br>So sleeps my love, my love, and yet my love doth wake.", "My love doth rage, and yet my love doth rest;</br>Fear in my love, and yet is my love secure;</br>Peace in my love, and yet my love opprest;</br>Impatient, yet of perfect tempratour.</br>Sleep, dainty love, while I sigh for thy sake;</br>So sleeps my love; and yet my love doth wake.</br>"]
