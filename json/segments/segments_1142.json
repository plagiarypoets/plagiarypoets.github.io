["Thou to whose pow'r reluctantly we bend,</br>Foe to Life's fairy dreams, relentless Time,</br>Alike the dread of Lover, and of Friend;</br>Why stamp thy seal on manhood's rosy prime?</br>Already twining midst my Thyrsis' hair,</br>The snowy wreaths of age, the monuments of care?", "Thro' all her forms, tho' Nature owns thy sway,</br>That boasted sway thou'lt here exert in vain,</br>To the last beam of Life's declining day,</br>Thyrsis shall view, unmov'd, thy potent reign.</br>Secure to please, while goodness knows to charm,</br>Fancy and Taste delight, and Sense and Truth inform.", "Tyrant, when from that lip of crimson glow,</br>Swept by thy chilling wing, the rose shall fly;</br>When thy rude scythe indents his polish'd brow,</br>And quench'd is all the lustre of his eye;</br>When ruthless age disperses ev'ry grace,</br>Each smile that beams from that enchanting face&mdash;", "Then, thro' her stores, shall active Mem'ry rove,</br>Teaching each various charm to bloom anew,</br>And still the raptur'd eye of faithful love,</br>Shall bend on Thyrsis its delighted view;</br>Still shall he triumph, with resistless pow'r,</br>Still rule the conquer'd heart to life's remotest hour!</br>"]
