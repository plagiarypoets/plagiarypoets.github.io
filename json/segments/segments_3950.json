["See Superstition, with dark scouling eyes,</br>Slow stalking o'er yon dusky gloom;</br>Now heaving deep foreboding sighs,</br>See her by turns each horrid shape assume.", "There hid by tall trees of a mournful green,</br>Almost impervious to the sun's bright rays;</br>The lofty spire of a Convent's seen,</br>Secluded from the world's unhallow'd gaze.", "There pensive Nuns slow count their solemn beads,</br>Consign'd for ever to the cloister'd gloom,</br>Pale Superstition each poor heart misleads,</br>And pining Sorrow robs them of their bloom.", "Their sighs re-echo thro' the fretted walls,</br>Mild Patience casts to Heav'n her dove-like eyes;</br>Alas!  in vain, the gushing tears now fall;</br>Ah!  now, in vain, is heard those heartfelt sighs.", "At distance now imperfect forms are seen,</br>Dimly to pass the winding chapel's way,</br>O'er the cold tomb see the pale spirits lean;</br>Wave their thin hands and slowly glide away.", "But, hark!  why tolls the heavy Convent bell?</br>The whistling winds now make a solemn pause;</br>Alas!  they ring some hapless sister's knell,</br>That now they bear away a lifeless corse.", "Now glimmering torches break the dismal gloom,</br>To earth mild Cynthia casts her beamy rays,</br>Some wretched victim seeks an early tomb,</br>For wasting Misery cut short her days.", "The fathers now consign her to the earth,</br>Then to their narrow cells they slow return;</br>Within those darksome walls adieu to mirth,</br>The wretched sisterhood for ever mourn.</br>"]
