["My Kitty is chearful and gay,</br>She's lovely and charming to me;</br>She's sweet as the flowers in May,</br>That gather their scents for the bee.", "Such graces her person adorn,</br>As render the virgin compleat;</br>The rose when refresh'd by the morn,</br>Is neither so blooming nor sweet.", "I've told this fair maid that I love,</br>But ah!  she will grant no relief:</br>And I've try'd all entreaties to move</br>Her to pity and banish my grief.", "Each morning as soon as 'tis day,</br>She drives forth her flocks to the mead;</br>Where sweetly she carols the lay,</br>Or jocundly pipes on the reed.", "Whenever I see her I run</br>To tell her how great is my pain;</br>But she flieth, my presence to shun,</br>Or treateth my vows with disdain.", "Come Cupid and wound her fond heart,</br>And make it no stranger to love:</br>That she may more kindness impart,</br>And every sorrow remove.", "Then succour would come to my breast,</br>And my pipe should resound through the plains;</br>With \"Kitty her shepherd has blest,</br>And made him the happiest of swains.\"</br>"]
