["Olympiaes matchlesse Son, whenas he knew</br>How many crowns his fathers sword had gaind,</br>With smoaking sighs, and deep-fetcht sobs did rew,</br>And his brave cheekes with scalding teares bedew,</br>Because that kingdomes now so few remain'd,</br>By his victorious Arme to bee obtain'd.", "So (Learned Daniel) when as thou didst see,</br>That Spenser erst so far had spred his fame,</br>That hee was Monark deem'd of Poesie,</br>Thou didst (I gesse) ev'n burne with Jealousie,</br>Lest Lawrell were not left enough to frame,</br>A neast sufficient for thine endlesse Name.", "But as that Pearle of Greece, soone after past</br>In wondrous conquests his renowned fire,</br>And others all, whose names by Fame are plac'te</br>In highest seate:  So hath thy Muse surpast</br>Spenser, and all that doe with hot desire,</br>To the Thunder-scorning Lawrel-crown aspire,", "And as his Empires linked force was knowne,</br>When each of those that did his Kingdoms share,</br>The mighti'st Kings in might did match alone:</br>So of thy skill the greatnes thus is showne,</br>That each of those, great Poets deemed are,</br>Who may in no one kinde with thee compare.", "One sharde out Greece, another Asia held,</br>And fertile Egypt to a third did fall,</br>But only Alexander all did wield.</br>So in soft pleasing Liricks some are skild,</br>In Tragicke some, some in Heroicall,</br>But thou alone art matchlesse in them all.</br>"]
