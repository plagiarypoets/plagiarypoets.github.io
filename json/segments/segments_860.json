["Far be remov'd each painted scene!</br>What is to me the sapphire sky?</br>What is to me the earth's soft dye?</br>Or fragrant vales which sink between</br>Those velvet hills?  yes, there I see&mdash;</br>(Why do those beauties burst on me?)</br>Pearl-dropping groves bow to the sun;</br>Seizing his beams, bright rivers run</br>That dart redoubled day:</br>Hope ye vain scenes, to catch the mind</br>To torpid sorrow all resign'd,</br>Or bid my heart be gay?</br>False are those hopes! &mdash; I turn &mdash; I fly,</br>Where no enchantment meets the eye,</br>Or soft ideas stray.", "HORROR!  I call thee from the mould'ring tower,</br>The murky church-yard, and forsaken bower,</br>Where 'midst unwholesome damps</br>The vap'ry gleamy lamps</br>Of ignes fatui, shew the thick-wove night,</br>Where morbid MELANCHOLY sits,</br>And weeps, and sings, and raves by fits,</br>And to her bosom strains the fancied sprite.", "Or, if amidst the arctic gloom</br>Thou toilest at thy sable loom,</br>Forming the hideous phantoms of Despair&mdash;</br>Instant thy grisly labours leave,</br>With raven wing the concave cleave,</br>Where floats, self-borne, the dense nocturnal air.", "Oh!  bear me to th' impending cliffs,</br>Under whose brow the dashing skiffs</br>Behold Thee seated on thy rocky throne;</br>There, 'midst the shrieking wild wind's roar,</br>Thy influence, HORROR, I'll adore,</br>And at thy magic touch, congeal to stone.", "Oh!  hide the Moon's obtrusive orb,</br>The gleams of ev'ry star absorb,</br>And let CREATION be a moment thine!</br>Bid billows dash; let whirlwinds roar,</br>And the stern, rocky-pointed shore,</br>The stranded bark, back to the waves resign!</br>Then, whilst from yonder turbid-cloud,</br>Thou roll'st thy thunders long, and loud,</br>And light'nings flash upon the deep below,</br>Let the expiring Seaman's cry,</br>The Pilot's agonizing sigh</br>Mingle, and in the dreadful chorus flow!", "HORROR!  far back thou dat'st thy reign;</br>Ere KINGS th' historic page could stain</br>With records black, or deeds of lawless power;</br>Ere empires Alexanders curst,</br>Or Faction, mad'ning Caesars nurst,</br>The frighted World receiv'd thy awful dower!", "Whose pen JEHOVAH'S self inspir'd;</br>He, who in eloquence attir'd,</br>Led Israel's squadrons o'er the earth,</br>Grandly terrific, paints thy birth.</br>Th' ALMIGHTY, 'midst his fulgent seat on high,</br>Where glowing Seraphs round his footstool fly,</br>Beheld the wanton cities of the plain,</br>With acts of deadly name his laws disdain;</br>He gave th' irrevocable sign,</br>Which mark'd to man the hate divine;</br>And sudden from the starting sky</br>The Angels of his wrath bid fly!</br>Then HORROR!  thou presidest o'er the whole,</br>And fill'd, and rapt, each self-accusing soul!</br>Thou did'st ascend to guide the burning shower&mdash;</br>On THEE th' Omnipotent bestow'd the hour!", "'Twas thine to scourge the sinful land,</br>'Twas thine to toss the fiery brand;</br>Beneath thy glance the temples fell,</br>And mountains crumbled at thy yell.</br>ONCE MORE thou'lt triumph in a fiery storm;</br>ONCE MORE the Earth behold thy direful form;</br>Then shalt thou seek, as holy prophets tell,</br>Thy native throne, amidst th' eternal shades of HELL!</br>"]
