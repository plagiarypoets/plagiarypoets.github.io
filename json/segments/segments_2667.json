["Here rest my breeches on the lap of earth</br>By Time destroyed, by Pride now cast away;</br>Whose waistband never knew the stretch of mirth,</br>Whose lining long ere this had felt decay.", "Oft has the needle tried its skill in vain,</br>Patch over patch full oft their knees have borne,</br>Oft have their rents my bosom doom'd to pain,</br>That sympathiz'd with them when they were torn.", "Not half so tough the hide of roasted pig,</br>Not more ambrosial was the damask rose;</br>Not half so comely was the parson's wig,</br>As ye my Breeches &mdash; best of all my clothes!", "'Till Time's unpitying hand (by fate design'd),</br>Your stitches, strength, and youth, hath from you borne;</br>So falls the flow'r before the ruthless wind,</br>So from its mate the guiltless turtle's torn,", "Here, while ye lie upon the teeming earth,</br>Altho' no shell your funeral pomp displays,</br>Far from your grave shall fly the rebel Mirth,</br>And dust and ashes serve instead of bays.</br>"]
