["\"Come, uninvok'd before, assist me now!\"</br>Star of my childhood!  hear thy votary's prayer,</br>So shall he still before thine altars bow,</br>So shall thy worship be his only care;</br>Now for a higher theme his hands prepare,</br>And if his unpremeditated lays</br>Denied the honors of the Bard to share,</br>Oh, teach him now to grasp at deathless praise,</br>And with thy favorite sons divide th' unfading bays.", "Fervent I pray'd; when flashing through the grove,</br>Burst forth a blaze more than solar light;</br>And far between the opening clouds above,</br>I saw the realms of rapture and delight;</br>Visions than the Poet's dreams more exquisite!</br>The Muse approach'd, wrapt in a robe of day</br>Too brightly beaming for this mortal sight;</br>And on the earth in speechless trance I lay,</br>Whilst from her throne a voice thus said, or seem'd to say:", "Presumptuous youth, for thy inglorious song</br>Dost thou the Muse's potent aid demand?</br>Canst thou imagine that to her belong</br>The wild designs thy frantic breast hath plann'd?</br>What!  ere the twentieth spring hath nerv'd thy hand,</br>Dar'st thou attempt to reach that awful lyre,</br>When scarce the mightiest of her chosen band,</br>Could bear the tumult of its bounding wire,</br>When waking in its pride forth roll its tones of fire.", "Then be awhile thine idle harp resign'd,</br>Go!  search the page where breath the bards of yore,</br>Collect from thence the \"shadowy tribes of mind,\"</br>And stamp a value on thy lighter lore;</br>The age of vain frivolity is o'er:</br>Howe'er attun'd to song thy soul may be,</br>Till Learning strengthens, try its powers no more,</br>But gratefully receive this truth from me,</br>Know, Wisdom is the source, the spring of Poesy.</br>"]
