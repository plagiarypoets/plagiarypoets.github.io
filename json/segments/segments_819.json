["Ye baleful Follow'rs of the Blatant Beast,</br>Who censure Matters far beyond your Ken,</br>Behold, I now present you with a Feast;</br>Rush forth like Wolves from your sequester'd Den,</br>And mangle all the Labors of my Pen.</br>Show, ye rude Louts, your lewd unhallow'd Rage,</br>In this I share the Fate of greater Men;</br>Pale Envy ever knaws the laurel'd Page,</br>And 'gainst all worthy Wight doth War perpetual wage.", "If thee, sweet Nymph, these simple Lines aggrate,</br>If I may hope to merit thine Esteem,</br>Not with the proudest would I change my State</br>Of those who deeply drink Castalia's Stream,</br>And on Parnassus catch th' inspiring Sream.</br>Say, thou dear Noursling of the Paphian Queen,</br>Wilt thou, ah!  wilt thou patronize my Theme,</br>So shall this Measure blunt the tooth of Spleen,</br>Nor Critic's Tongue shall blast such favor'd Lines, I ween.", "See!  how the Tribe of Witlings shun the Place,</br>And deep in Shades conceal their Fronts of Brass;</br>The Coxcomb talks of Feathers, Cloaths, and Lace,</br>Nay Codrus un-impeach'd doth let me pass,</br>Codrus, of Pride and Spite a mighty Mass.</br>Thus when a Set of Imps at Midnight play,</br>And tear the Coarses from the hallow'd Grass;</br>Soon as the Sun unbars the Gates of Day,</br>They fear his heav'nly Light and melt in Air away.</br>"]
