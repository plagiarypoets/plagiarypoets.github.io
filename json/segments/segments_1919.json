["Nymph of the pallid hue, and downcast eye,</br>Around whose brow a wreath of cypress twines,</br>For ever doom'd to breathe the pensive sigh,</br>And beat that breast where comfort never shines;</br>To thee, when dissipated crouds retire,</br>I tune the sad, the woe-expressive lyre.", "Me to some tott'ring abbey-ruins bear,</br>When trembling twilight o'er the landscape falls,</br>Where hollow echoes vibrate on the ear,</br>And the long moss droops from the mould'ring walls;</br>There midst decaying structures let me muse,</br>Nor heed the clammy mists nor chilly dews.", "At midnight hoar with thee I'll wander o'er</br>The dreary heath; th' ungenial damps defy;</br>Or, stretch'd along the hollow-beaten shore,</br>While the pale moon gleams from the cloudless sky;</br>Amid the circling shades that whelm the night,</br>Catch the faint glimm'rings of some watch-tower's light.", "Or, where funereal yews spread o'er the tomb,</br>Join'd hand in hand with thee, sad Nymph, I'll go,</br>To mark where Grief, enwrapt in awful gloom,</br>By the blue taper sheds her floods of woe,</br>And, weeping, wears the tardy hours away,</br>Till Morn's alarming clock proclaims the day.", "Pleasure, avaunt!  with all thy syren-crew,</br>Hence!  ever may I flee their wanton pow'r;</br>And bid a long farewel, a last adieu,</br>To all the revels of the midnight hour!</br>Hark!  heard'st thou not the direful shrieks of pain?</br>Disease and death await the thoughtless train.", "Dejected Maid!  with thee content to dwell,</br>I shun the noise of Folly's idle brood,</br>To seek thee in thy solitary cell,</br>Where vain delusive joys can ne'er intrude;</br>But Contemplation calm, the nymph divine,</br>Numbers the twinkling planets as they shine.</br>"]
