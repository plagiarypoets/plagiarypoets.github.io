["What shepherd or nymph of the grove</br>Can blame me for dropping a tear,</br>Or lamenting aloud as I rove,</br>Since Susan no longer is here!</br>My flocks, if at random they stray,</br>What wonder, since she's from the plain!</br>Her hand they were us'd to obey,</br>She rul'd both the sheep and the swain.", "Can I ever forget how we stray'd</br>To the foot of yon neighbouring hill,</br>To the bower we had built in the shade,</br>And the river that runs by the mill!</br>Then sweet, by my side as she lay,</br>And heard the fond stories I told,</br>How sweet was the thrush from the spray,</br>And the bleating of lambs from the fold!", "How oft would I spy out a charm</br>That before had been hid from my view,</br>And as arm was infolded in arm</br>My lips to her lips how they grew!</br>How oft the sweet contest wou'd last</br>Till the hour of retirement and rest,</br>What pleasures and pains each had past,</br>Who longest had lov'd, and who best!", "No changes of place or of time</br>I felt while my fair-one was near,</br>Alike was each weather and clime,</br>Each season that chequers the year.</br>In winter's rude lap did we freeze,</br>Did we melt on the bosom of May,</br>Each morn brought contentment and ease,</br>If we rose up to work or to play.", "She was all my fond wishes cou'd ask,</br>She had all the kind gods can impart,</br>She was nature's most beautiful task,</br>The despair and the envy of art.</br>There all that was worthy to prize</br>In all that is lovely was drest,</br>For the graces were throng'd in her eyes,</br>And the virtues all lodg'd in her breast.</br>"]
