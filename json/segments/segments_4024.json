["Lady!  I feel that praise so poor as mine</br>Can add no lustre to thy well-earn'd fame;</br>Yet fain would I one wreath of song entwine,</br>And \"garland with sweet verse\" thy gentle name!</br>To whom both bard and minstrel's lay is dear,</br>Whose graceful hands have rais'd a trophy o'er their bier.", "I trace thy glowing page!  the gentle theme,</br>Rehears'd by thee, becomes most eloquent!</br>It lives before me, like a beauteous dream</br>To which thy pen a magic spell hath lent!</br>A graceful shadow of departed years,</br>Blent with the rainbow's hues, thy charmed page appears.", "Well hast thou gather'd in that classic page</br>Each gem that time had scatter'd; and hast bound,</br>In one bright wreath, the bard of ev'ry age,</br>Whoever, with the poet's bays were crown'd!</br>And from oblivion's wave hast snatch'd away</br>Full many a \"child of song,\" fast sinking to decay!", "Worthy thyself to be a \"poet's love,\"</br>And realize on earth his heaven-lit dream,</br>Oh!  gentle lady!  thou thyself dost prove</br>A living subject for poetic theme!</br>A vision air, to wake the minstrel's song,</br>Since unto thee must all that poets prize belong.", "Wit, sense, and elegance!  and feeling deep,</br>A heart by sentiment and taste refin'd,</br>Within whose gentle casket, safe may sleep</br>Love's very self; but chasten'd and confin'd!</br>Ere yet one soil of earth hath touch'd his wing,</br>Such love as Klopstock felt, and did not blush to sing!", "But ah!  some hand less feeble far than mine</br>Should weave for THEE the poet's wreath of praise!</br>Where sleep our modern bards, that none entwine,</br>To crown thy brows, the myrtle and the bays?</br>I blush to think a WOMAN'S hand must bring</br>Unto a sister's shrine this simple offering!</br>"]
