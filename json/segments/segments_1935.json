["'Tis now fifty or sixty years since,</br>(The date of a charming old boy of a Prince)</br>Since the feathered god Mercury happened to lose</br>A thing no less precious than one of his shoes:</br>I say no less precious, because in the mention</br>The artist has made of this very invention,</br>(Old Homer, who furnished the gods with such things)</br>He says, 'twas immortal, of gold, and had wings.</br>The latter indeed are as famous as Love's,</br>And they rivalled in hue even Venus's doves;</br>For at every fresh turn, and least touch into light,</br>Which the clear God of Eloquence took in his flight,</br>They varied their colours in fifty directions,</br>And perfectly dazzled with brilliant reflections.", "'I wonder,' said Mercury, &mdash; putting his head</br>One rosy-faced morning from Venus's bed,&mdash;</br>'I wonder, my dear Cytherea, &mdash; don't you?&mdash;</br>What can have become of that rogue of a shoe.</br>I've searched every corner to make myself certain,</br>And lifted, I'm sure, ev'ry possible curtain,</br>And how I'm to manage, by Jove, I don't know,</br>For manage I must, and to earth I must go.</br>'Tis now a whole week since I lost it; and here,</br>Like a dove whom your urchin has crippled, my dear,</br>Have I loitered, and fluttered, and looked in those eyes,</br>While Juno keeps venting her crabbed surprise;</br>And Apollo, with all that fine faith in his air,</br>Asks me daily accounts of Rousseau and Voltaire,</br>And Jove (whom it's awkward to risk such a thing with)</br>Has not enough thunder to frighten a king with.</br>So &mdash; there then &mdash; now don't look so kind, I beseech you,</br>Or else I shall stay a week longer, you witch you&mdash;</br>I can't ask the gods; but I'll search once again</br>For this fugitive shoe, and if still it's in vain,</br>I must try to make something a while of sheer leather,</br>And match with a mortal my fair widowed feather.'", "So saying, the God put a leg out of bed,</br>And summoned his winged cap on to his head;</br>And the widow in question flew smack round his foot,</br>And up he was getting to end his pursuit,</br>When Venus said softly (so softly, that he</br>Turned about on his elbow) &mdash; 'What!  go without me?'", "Now the fact was, that Venus, who always would please a</br>Fine wit, had been reading the New Eloisa,</br>And having prodigiously felt and admired it,</br>Couldn't but say so to him who inspired it.</br>Therefore, to take the due steps for expressing</br>Her sense of such very well-worded caressing,</br>She had sent down to earth this same Shoe with an errand</br>To get a new pair at Ashburton for her, and</br>Not think of returning without what it went for,</br>Unless by its master especially sent for.</br>The Shoe made a scrape; and concluding the thing</br>Had been settled 'twixt her and his master, took wing;</br>And never ceased beating through sunshine and rain,</br>Now clasped in a cloud, and now loosened again,</br>Till it came to Ashburton, where something so odd</br>Seemed to strike it, it could not help saying, 'My God!'", "I know not precisely how much of this matter</br>Was mentioned, when Mercury sparkled round at her;</br>But Venus proposed, that as one Shoe was fled,</br>Her good easy virtue should help him instead</br>'You know, love,' said she, ''tis as light as a feather;</br>And so I'll be guide, and we'll go down together.'", "I leave you to fancy how little he checked her:</br>They chalked out their journey, got up, took their nectar;</br>And then, with his arm round her waist, and his eyes</br>Looking thanks upon hers, came away from the skies.</br>I cannot, I own, say he came much the faster,</br>How earnest soever he looked and embraced her;</br>But never before, though a God of much grace,</br>Had he come with such fine overlooking of face;</br>And as she travelled seldom herself in this style,</br>With a lover beside her, and clasped all the while,</br>'Tis said that the earth was remarkably moved:</br>Even marriers for money imagined they loved:</br>Yes, inanimate things fell exchanging caresses,</br>Till Princes embraced their own legal Princesses:</br>Not one pair of birds or respectable brutes,</br>Nay, not one of gloves, but, they say, followed suits,</br>And the bishops but walked in the steps of their boots.", "All felt but one Shoe. &mdash; O ye gods from above,</br>Who descended that day with your wit and your love,</br>Assist now my theme, which grows dark at the touch,</br>That I neither may honour nor hate it too much!</br>Yes, all but one Shoe:  not the shoe that was missing,</br>For that one, as much as lay in it, loved kissing;</br>But one which as Venus and Mercury put up</br>Somewhere at Ashburton, nigh tripped her sweet foot up.", "The kind Goddess (one of whose charmingest qualities</br>'Tis, at a small thing, to reckon how small it is)</br>Laughed, and said, 'Well, who'd have thought this of you,</br>With that drag in your aspect, my poor little Shoe?</br>Here, come kiss my foot, as a proof we agree:'</br>But the Shoe huffed, &mdash; as who should say, 'Don't talk to me'</br>'It wants comprehension,' said Mercury, 'surely,</br>And yet there seems life in it, though it looks poorly.</br>Int'rest, I dare say, will make something of it:</br>My strange little friend, don't you know your own profit?'</br>'Aye, aye, well enough,' said the Shoe in a tone</br>Of uneasy contempt, 'twixt a creak and a groan</br>'I was made for a Squire; and my instinct has told me,</br>That if through the dirt with discretion I hold me</br>My service, some day, will be under an Earl,</br>Which I think's something higher than you and your girl.'", "At this, the two Deities set up a shout,</br>Which made all the neighbours leap up and look out:</br>For they thought 'twas the players with music at least,</br>Or that London, or Heaven, was come from the east.</br>But the Shoe, deaf and blind to all beautiful things,</br>Scarce showed more emotion than if 'twere a king's:</br>It did, indeed, slightly perk up its two straps,</br>Like the ears of an ass, when he's sulky, and snaps.", "The lovers perceived that it knew not their rank,</br>Or 'twould no more have spurned 'em than kicked at the bank</br>'Twas this that amused 'em. 'But pray, Sir,' said they,</br>'What induced your high Heel-tap to get in our way?'", "'Why, I can't bear,' returned this most cross-grained of leathers,</br>'To look at your shoe there, tricked out in such feathers.</br>Why need any shoe be more gifted than I?</br>There was just such another' &mdash; (here Venus looked sly,</br>And Hermes guessed all she'd omitted to say)&mdash;</br>'Here was just such another came mincing this way,</br>And would fain have come in for some shoes for a Lady;</br>But no, no; I trod on his toes with a 'Hey-day!'</br>On which the fop gave me a cuff with his quill,</br>And whisked away laughing; but I'll pity him still.'", "'You had better be quiet,' said Hermes, 'for stuff,</br>Such as yours, can no more wage war with his cuff</br>Than the monster with Perseus, who fell on him, plumed.'</br>'I know,' said the Shoe, as it fretted and fumed.</br>'You do?' said the God; 'then with such an example</br>How monsters should treat the fair sex, would you trample</br>Or offer to do it (for so it now seems)</br>On a foot which surpasses a lover's best dreams?'", "'I hate your surpassings, and loves, and all that,'</br>Cried the Shoe, screaming weak like a leather-toed bat;</br>'And since you will have it, I tell you, you fop,</br>That I'd kick the best shoe ever stepped into shop.'", "But now the God, angered, shot into that leather</br>A terrible sense of who stood there together,</br>And while it slunk, shaking, half into itself,</br>Denounced it in words, that shall die on no shelf:&mdash;", "'Vile Soul of a Shoe, &mdash; that with decent self-knowledge</br>Had honoured the good man that made thee at college,</br>And walked through the world, if with not many graces,</br>At least in good steps and calm classical places,</br>My very stray slipper that passed thee, and hit,</br>Might have done thee some good, for it brushed thee with wit;</br>But every thing, even Adversity fails,</br>To refine the grain in thee:  the calf-skin prevails.</br>Attend then my curse, while thou shrinkest into thee,</br>And let the ambition thou spoilest, undo thee.", "'As soon as I finish my words, thou shalt be,</br>Not a man, for thou canst not, but human to see:</br>Thy appearance at least shall be taken for human,</br>However perplexing to painter or woman.</br>In ev'ry thing else, thou shalt be as thou art,</br>A thing made for dirty ways, hollow at heart.</br>Serve an Earl, as thou say'st;
