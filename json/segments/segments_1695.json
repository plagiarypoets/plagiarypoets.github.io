["Here Collins sleeps, whose tender breast</br>With Pity's softest touch was bless'd;</br>Bless'd with those joys that only spring</br>When Pity stoops her balmy wing,</br>And from the skies, a welcome guest,</br>Thrills through the kindred mourner's breast.</br>Aye, Collins, such the joys you knew,</br>Whilst Pleasure's roses round thee blew;</br>But, ah!  how dread thy latter doom,</br>That brought thee to this hallow'd tomb.</br>The laurel'd wreath, the myrtles gay,</br>Whose bloom had deck'd thy better day,</br>And e'en thy high-inspir'd mind:</br>Brush'd by the rude and ruffian sweep</br>Of black Misfortune's hand;</br>Gone is the myrtle's brilliant hue, the mind decays, the laurel'd band,</br>That erst so well thy temples bound,</br>Now twines thy broken lute around,</br>Whose notes, soft sighing to the breeze, lament thy lot unkind.</br>Gone is the bard whose mighty strains could give,</br>In wildest train,</br>The passions of the mind,</br>The fire that bade dun flickering visions live,</br>Ta'en.</br>In light Fancy's web, by eloquence refin'd,</br>Gone!  gone!  gone!</br>To that lone house confin'd,</br>The dread dark bourne of thee and all mankind.</br>And didst thou mourn thy hapless brother's fate,</br>Bid Pity weeping tell her votary's tale,</br>And shall no bard, in plaintive strains relate,</br>The sorrows of thy doom, and bid the wild harp wail?", "Yes, Collins, to thy sacred tomb,</br>A bard, to Fame's loud voice unknown,</br>Has come to gaze, to sigh, to moan,</br>Then pass unnotic'd and alone,</br>Sad musing on thy doom.</br>Hark, how the pillar'd aisle along,</br>Pours the loud voice of sacred song;</br>Now gently sinking, murmuring, dying,</br>Like cherub choir, on some wild cloud flying;</br>Now swelling, thrilling, thundering round,</br>Awful sweeps the echoing sound;</br>Down the aisles triumphant flowing,</br>Strains with hope and rapture glowing,</br>To the Eternal's throne our praises bear.</br>But list!  it flies,</br>It sinks, it dies,</br>In a slow majestic fall,</br>Whose long vibrations shake the lofty wall,</br>Till distant heard, one solemn note</br>Comes with sweet undulating float,</br>Upon the soft wings of the charmed air.", "Great bard, thus where thy ashes sleep</br>The varied streams of music roll,</br>On Fancy's ear they wildly sweep,</br>And renovate the soul.</br>Say!  Heard ye not that magic strain,</br>That mingled with the mortal choir,</br>'Twas Collins self that spoke again,</br>And touch'd the impassion'd lyre;</br>See rising at the thrilling sound,</br>Wild terror breaks the silent tomb,</br>Begirt with shadowy monsters round,</br>And veiled in murky gloom.</br>Varying with the chanting strain,</br>Airy shapes in tumult rise,</br>Anger fierce, distorted pain,</br>That rends the vault with hideous cries.</br>Once again the notes breathe slow,</br>Strains symphonious melt in air;</br>Sudden flies the pageant shew,</br>Back recoils, half seen, Despair.", "Lo!  what form divinely bright</br>Floats in streams of purple light;</br>Moving to the dulcet measure,</br>Breathing awe and chastest pleasure;</br>'Tis the mortal-loving maid,</br>Last to fly, and first to aid,&mdash;</br>Hope, enchanting Hope, 'tis thou,</br>By the gently smiling brow,</br>By thy glass, whose shadows shew</br>Future joys, midst present woe;</br>By thy golden waving hair,</br>Vernal cheek, and bosom fair:</br>This is the goddess of thy praise,</br>Collins, in thy halcyon days.", "Again!  again, the uproar loud</br>Bursts upon the startled ear;</br>Again returns the yelling croud,</br>Led on by frantic Fear.</br>He starts, he shrinks, at every wind,</br>And strives, but dare not, look behind.", "But, O!  what yell terrific burst</br>From the mansions of the dead?</br>'Twas moody Madness' laugh accurs'd,</br>By wild Remorse and Horror led.</br>Such, Collins, was the fearful guest</br>That led, through agony, thy soul to rest.", "They melt, they vanish, from my view,</br>The unsubstantial vision's fled,</br>The shades of those his pencil drew.</br>Peace to the manes of th' immortal dead.</br>"]
