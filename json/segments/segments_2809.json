["Tho' Summer exerts her sweet pow'r,</br>Tho' roses and jessamines bloom,</br>Tho' the eglantines twine round my bow'r,</br>And spread all my fields with perfume,</br>No joy can these prospects impart,</br>When Phillida she is not nigh;</br>Like a turtle then droops my fond heart,</br>When depriv'd of its mate and its joy.", "When winter howls thro' the dark skies,</br>And the sun scarce illumines the day,</br>When the storms and the tempests arise,</br>And the thrush sits alone on the spray,</br>Then if Phillida grace my low cot,</br>How charming the prospects appear!</br>The cold of the season's forgot,</br>And it seems but the spring of the year.", "Thro' the fields and the meadows so gay,</br>How oft do we carelessly roam,</br>Or past the soft riv'lets do stray,</br>Nor think of our distance from home;</br>The turtle that cooes for its mate,</br>The lambkins that play in the grove,</br>New pleasure these objects create,</br>And supply us with topics of love.", "But hark!  the hoarse tempests arise,</br>The torrents impetuous descend,</br>Black clouds sweep along the dark skies,</br>And we spy no kind refuge at hand;</br>Even so when our youth is no more,</br>And our juvenile sun-shine is past,</br>'Tis then the gay scenes are all o'er,</br>And we shiver before the bleak blast.", "But love shall a refuge supply,</br>When youth, wit and beauty, shall fade,</br>'Tis love which shall ease the deep sigh,</br>And conduct our old steps thro' the glade;</br>And when we resign our last breath,</br>'Tis love shall his succours impart</br>Shall blunt the keen arrow of death,</br>And raise with soft comfort the heart.</br>"]
