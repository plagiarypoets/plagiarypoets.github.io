["Let these the musky-scented meads describe,</br>'Till long description pall Attention's ear;</br>And those of Amaryl and Daphne tell,</br>Till Venus pity and fulfil their loves.</br>Let some their revels Bacchanalian</br>(Revels liquor-urg'd, till languid reason</br>Drown'd in folly quit her mental throne,</br>And yield to laughing madness drunken joy;)</br>When morning clears the visual nerve, extol</br>And praise what cool reflexion should disdain:</br>And others, in soft pastoral, rehearse,</br>Or Tempe's charms or swains Arcadian.</br>Thrice happy in their simple state of life,</br>Thrice happy in their loves, loves undiseas'd</br>With foul intrigue, the Debauchee's delight;</br>Delight which terminates in loathsome thought.</br>I say, let others fancy please as best</br>It suits their genius, muse, and turn;</br>And COPYWELL, multiloquent of screw,</br>For cork design'd, or of his caxon preach,</br>Of potent porter, or of pudding sing:</br>I sing my stick, pre-eminent of sticks,</br>Torn from its mother crab in hedge of thorn,</br>In the first lustrum of its hopeful growth.</br>What time its tap'ring top, the hedge's top</br>Above began to tower, and own the tree</br>From whence descended, it was giv'n to shoot</br>To grace my hand; eradicated now,</br>It feels no more the spring's enliv'ning ray,</br>Nor buds obedient to the season kind,</br>Or gives to summer green or autumn leaf.</br>Strange revolution!  In the oven laid</br>It sweats profuse, and yields to fashion fair,</br>By carvers beauty-forming hand display'd.</br>Rare artist!  Is it then to thee I owe</br>The many beauties which my stick adorn?</br>The polish'd nodes, and the depressions smooth,</br>Like hills and dales irregularly seen,</br>In vernal view romantically gay.</br>The spiry twills, the polish'd nodes between,</br>Add ornamental strength, and grace the whole.</br>Nor must its lustrous head remain unsung.</br>If great ones may to small ones be compar'd,</br>Its head majestic bears a crown, a crown</br>Pinchbeckian, whose ample belly beds</br>A dagger for its foe, its master's foe:</br>For who my stick offends, me must offend</br>And hurt my pride, intolerable pain!</br>The stroke of pride, without resentment keen,</br>Who ever could, or ever will endure?</br>My stick I highly prize, beware ye beasts,</br>Not me attack when Syrius' fatal power</br>The fatal hydrophobia dooms</br>To race ferocious; or Bacchus blust'ring</br>In the heated breast of youth courageous,</br>Unreasonably bold and seeking whom,</br>He may insult.  O let his better fate</br>Or genius reign, and lull him into sleep</br>Before he loads me with absurd reproach,</br>Or by the goad of fancied wrong awakes</br>The ready vengeance of my parlous arm.</br>When from his urn Aquarius pours profuse</br>The liquid burden of the pregnant clouds,</br>And dirt obscene misgives unwary feet;</br>Me shall my stick uphold, and save me from</br>Th' offending bosom of the miry ground.</br>When ev'ning shuts the closing eye of day,</br>And I the bower'd path alone explore,</br>Meand'ring thro' a tedious way of wood,</br>In whose dark bosom many a ruffian lurks</br>For purpose dark!  The poor benighted swain</br>To rob, seal perchance that robbery with blood:&mdash;</br>Then shall, e'er faithful to my cause, my stick</br>Upon the bloody foe reck vengeance warm,</br>And lay the villain trembling at my feet.</br>Thro' farmers yards or by the tanners pits,</br>Whene'er I wander with my plant in hand,</br>I fearless walk, nor dread the rage of dogs.</br>A time there was when as I saunter'd slow,</br>Absorb'd in thought, a mastiff fierce and loud</br>Broke on my silence, and my dog abus'd:</br>Nor him abus'd alone, but snarl'd at me</br>Appall'd:  till from its cavern dark I hurl'd</br>The pointed terror of insulting curs;</br>Mindless awhile of which the bravo stood,</br>And held in scorn the menace of my arm;</br>Till sudden piercing thro' his nether leg,</br>I dealt the sharp premeditated wound;</br>Then hideous cries proclaim'd his near escape,</br>Proclaim'd at distance, for long way he ran,</br>And frighten'd all his species with his howls.</br>Such service merits the reward of praise,</br>And praise I will the weapon of my guard;</br>Nor grudge the beau his scabbard of defence,</br>For mode more priz'd than priz'd for real use.</br>The sword I covet not, give me my stick,</br>And fear occasion for its use, ye curs</br>Of every kind, or human or canine.</br>"]
