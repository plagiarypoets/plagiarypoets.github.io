["What sorrow invades my fond breast,</br>How transient was Colin's delight,</br>I chearfully courted my rest,</br>When Phillis was kind in my sight.</br>I told her soft themes of my love,</br>And brought her a lamb from my fold,</br>My reed tun'd her praise through the grove,</br>And I valued her smiles more than gold.", "A chaplet from Flora I stole,</br>Compos'd of the blossoms that grow,</br>Where the streamlets meandering roll</br>Through a valley of roses below.</br>I brought her a goldfinch's nest,</br>It hurt me to rob the poor bird;</br>To her cheek the soft younglings she press'd</br>And my innocent present preferr'd.", "With pinks and with lilies her crook,</br>'Twas my care, ev'ry morning to dress,</br>Did she give in return a kind look,</br>My stars I was ready to bless.</br>But why did I dance on the lea?</br>Why partial to Phillis appear?</br>She smil'd not on love or on me&mdash;</br>Was ever a maid so severe?", "'Twas Corydon, swain of the hill,</br>That Phillis to Colin preferr'd;</br>My eyes shall dissolve like a rill,</br>Whenever I mention the word.</br>Deceit was a snake in her smile,</br>Go, Phillis, my heart shall not break,</br>In turn I will learn to beguile,</br>And to-morrow begin at the wake.</br>"]
