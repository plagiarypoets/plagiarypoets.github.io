["Hail silent moral'st!  where, in times of yore,</br>The voice of Gladness, sounded thro' thy dome;</br>Whose festive halls have chear'd the village poor,</br>And sent them happy to their lowly home.", "Here Fathers may have hail'd their sons return</br>With knowledge that might grace their riper years&mdash;</br>And pale Affliction oft her cares might mourn,</br>And strive to drown her sorrows in her tears.", "Thy halls have rang when lovers of the chace,</br>Warm from the field have blest the sparkling bowl;</br>In jocund ring convers'd &mdash; the sons of ease!</br>And spoke aloud the rapture of the soul.", "And many a happy pair might fondly stray,</br>And mark each beauty of thy glowing scene,</br>And listen to the sweetly-warbled lay,</br>And bless their mutual love and joys serene.", "Perhaps some bosom by the Nine inspir'd,</br>Might, wand'ring, catch from hence the glowing line,&mdash;</br>Some tint which Nature's children may have fir'd&mdash;</br>Some thoughts that gave the breast to warmth divine.", "Ah!  now how chang'd! &mdash; how wild appears the scene</br>Where Life and all its sweets were wont to glow;</br>Dread Desolation spreads the space within!</br>And briars &mdash; and mould'ring walls bespeak its woe!</br>"]
