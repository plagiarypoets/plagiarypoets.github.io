["STROPHE.</br>O Thou, who sitt'st a smiling Bride</br>By Valour's armed and awful Side,</br>Gentlest of Sky-born Forms and best adored:</br>Who oft with Songs, divine to hear,</br>Win'st from his fatal Grasp the Spear,</br>And hid'st in Wreaths of Flow'rs his bloodless Sword!</br>Thou who, amidst the deathful Field,</br>By Godlike Chiefs alone beheld,</br>Oft with thy Bosom bare art found,</br>Pleading for him the Youth who sinks to Ground:</br>See, Mercy, see, with pure and loaded Hands,</br>Before thy Shrine my Country's Genius stands,</br>And decks thy Altar still, tho' pierc'd with many a Wound!", "ANTISTROPHE.</br>When he whom ev'n our Joys provoke,</br>The Fiend of Nature, join'd his Yoke,</br>And rush'd in Wrath to make our Isle his Prey;</br>Thy Form, from out thy sweet Abode,</br>O'ertook Him on his blasted Road,</br>And stop'd his Wheels, and look'd his Rage away.", "I see recoil his sable Steeds,</br>That bore Him swift to Salvage Deeds,</br>Thy tender melting Eyes they own;</br>O Maid, for all thy Love to Britain shown,</br>Where Justice bars her Iron Tow'r,</br>To Thee we build a roseate Bow'r,</br>Thou, Thou shalt rule our Queen, and share our Monarch's Throne!</br>"]
