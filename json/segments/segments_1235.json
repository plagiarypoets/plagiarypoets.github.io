["To please our rough illiterate Sires</br>Rude minstrels tun'd their native lyres;</br>Tho' stern the temper of the times,</br>They felt the power of homely rhimes;</br>Tho' sever'd by the surly main,</br>Sweet Poesy here rais'd her strain.</br>Our home-inspir'd Bards of old</br>Amus'd our Knights and Barons bold;</br>So could pathetic ballads move</br>To arms, to pity, or to love.</br>No fabled streams, nor Grecian glades</br>They knew, nor Heliconian maids;</br>Yet Nature taught them glorious themes,</br>They sung of woods and azure streams,</br>In war what dangers Heroes prove,</br>And what the woes of faithful Love.</br>Alfred by song his Saxons train'd,</br>And savage manners were restrain'd;</br>By song did Chaucer, antient Sage,</br>Instruct his rough, heroic age.", "But when at length bright Learning's day</br>Had chac'd the morning clouds away,</br>True Taste illumin'd all the isle,</br>And classic Genius deign'd to smile:</br>The destin'd aera now was come,</br>When we should rival Greece and Rome.</br>Harmonious Spenser, at the head,</br>Through fairy wilds the Muses led.</br>Then Shakespear rose, of boundless mind,</br>And held a mirror to mankind.</br>Milton, divine enthusiast, shone</br>In themes to antient Bards unknown:</br>He on aspiring pinions soar'd,</br>And Heaven's glorious realms explor'd;</br>He view'd the Earth in all its show,</br>And rang'd the awful worlds below:</br>While utter darkness veil'd his eyes,</br>Each night a Spirit from the skies</br>With hymns consol'd his lonely hours,</br>Befriended by the harmonious powers.</br>Then Dryden charm'd the wondering times,</br>Nor felt the shackles of his rhimes;</br>His breast with native spirit glow'd,</br>From him the verse instinctive flow'd,</br>And to this Poet England owes</br>The chastest graces of her prose:</br>Penury and Superstition blind</br>Could not depress his vigorous mind;</br>But yet the morals of his age</br>Too often stain his glowing page.</br>Our favourite Pope, with nicer care,</br>The powers propitious deigned to rear:</br>Sound learning, thought and taste refin'd,</br>To form his genius were combin'd,</br>And Virtue tip'd his arrows keen,</br>Tho' wounded knaves might term it spleen.</br>Nor here can I forget that Northern Bard,</br>Whose honest fame has far been heard;</br>Thomson, whose manly, natural lays,</br>Amus'd my early, sauntering days.</br>O wanderer of Richmond's Vale,</br>Thy generous spirit let me hail!</br>The Doric melody, the Muse</br>Did not to thy grave songs refuse;</br>Fond Fancy o'er they visions smil'd,</br>And Nature show'd her beauties wild!</br>But long the task to tell each name</br>Mark'd in the kalendar of Fame;</br>Nor ought we thankless to disdain</br>Whate'er the Muse, of chaster vein,</br>Has in our later age inspir'd;</br>Our Druid Mason is admir'd,</br>And more his nobler brother Gray;</br>Nor scorn we Beattie's minstrel lay.", "But, ah, the change!
