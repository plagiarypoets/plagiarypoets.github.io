["When pale October bade the flow'rs adieu,</br>And Autumn sung amid the seaman's shrouds,</br>Methought I saw four winged forms that flew</br>With garments streaming light amid the clouds;</br>From adverse regions of the sky</br>In dim succession they went by:</br>The first, as o'er the billowy deep he past,</br>Blew from his shadowy trump a war-denouncing blast.", "Upon a beaked promontory high,</br>With streaming beard, and cloudy brow severe,</br>I mark'd the Father of the frowning year:</br>Dark vapours roll'd o'er the tempestuous sky.</br>When creeping Winter from his cave came forth&mdash;</br>\"Stern Herald of the storm, what from the North!\"</br>'Shouts and the noise of Battle!'  and again</br>He blew from his dark trump a deadlier blast,</br>'Shouts, and the noise of Battle:'  the long main</br>Seem'd with hoarse voice to answer as he past.", "The moody South went by, and silence kept;</br>The cloudy rack oft hid his mournful mien,</br>And frequent fell the show'r, as if he wept</br>The eternal havock of this mortal scene;</br>As if he wish'd for ever thus to throw</br>His misty mantle o'er a world of woe.", "But rousing him from his desponding trance</br>Cold Eurus blew his short and shrilling horn,</br>In his right hand he bore an icy lance,</br>That far off glitter'd in the frost of morn.</br>The Old Man knew the clarion from afar&mdash;</br>\"What from the East!\"  he cry'd:  'Shouts and the noise of War!'", "Who comes in soft and spicy vest</br>From the mild region of the West,</br>An azure veil bends waving o'er his head,</br>And show'rs of violets at his feet are spread?</br>'Tis Zephyr, with a look as young and fair</br>As when his lucid wings convey'd</br>That beautiful and gentle maid</br>Psyche, transported thro' the air</br>The blissful couch of Love's own god to share;</br>He brings again the morn of May;</br>The Lark amid the clear blue sky</br>Carols, but is not seen so high;</br>And all the howling winds fly far away.</br>I cried, \"O Father of the world, whose might</br>The storm, the darkness, and the winds obey;</br>Oh when will thus the long tempestuous night</br>Of warfare and of woe be roll'd away?</br>O when will cease the uproar and the din,</br>And Peace breathe soft, 'Summer is coming in'?\"</br>"]
