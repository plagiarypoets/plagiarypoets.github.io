["How delightful the season of May,</br>When zephyrs come falling along!</br>The meadows how cheerful and gay!</br>How sweet is the Nightingale's song!</br>The groves fragrant odours exhale</br>When refreshed by the still dropping shower</br>And sweet is the eglantine gale,</br>But sweeter Humanity's Power.", "When Summer, refulgent array'd,</br>Dart's fiercely his vertical beam,</br>How welcome the tremulous shade!</br>How refreshing the chrystalline stream!</br>The breezes soft transports bestow,</br>As they glide o'er the jessamine bower,</br>But more grateful the pleasures which flow,</br>From gentle Humanity's Power.", "What can charm like fair Autumn's mild ray</br>When the fields their rich treasures resign?</br>Or what greater beauty display</br>Then the smooth polish'd fruit of the vine?</br>Is there aught like the morning can please?</br>Or the smile of the sun-setting hour?</br>Yes, far more engaging than these,</br>Are the beams of Humanity's Power.", "More mild than the calm vernal scene,</br>More grateful than Summer retreats,</br>More engaging than Autumn serene,</br>When Nature her promise completes;</br>More gentle than zephyrs soft wind,</br>And more sweet than the jessamine flow'r,</br>Are the joys of the tranquiliz'd mind,</br>Which glows with Humanity's Power.</br>"]
