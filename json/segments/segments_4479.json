["Beneath a sad and silent shade,</br>The poor afflicted muse was laid;</br>The shepherd train, the virgin choir,</br>No longer listened to the lyre,</br>But sad, neglected, and alone,</br>Her feeling and her fire were gone;</br>Nor more she wanders forth in taste,</br>The beauties of the flowery waste,</br>Nor flutters more on wanton wing,</br>Nor leaves her in yon lucid spring;</br>Nor wooes with undisturbed delight,</br>The pale cheeked virgin of the night,</br>That piercing thro' the leafy bower,</br>Throws on the ground a slivery shower.</br>No rapture swells the linnet's voice,</br>No more the vocal groves rejoice;</br>And e'en thy song, sweet bird of Eve,</br>With whom she loved so oft to grieve,</br>Now scarce regarded meets the ear,</br>Nor more extracts the pearly tear.</br>Yet if, perchance, she she sought delight,</br>'Twas 'midst the deepest glooms of night;</br>To hear the wailing screech-owl's cry,</br>Or whistling whirlwinds rend the sky,</br>Or pacing o'er the mouldering wall,</br>Of some lone abbey's Gothick hall,</br>To pour her sadly melting strain,</br>And catch a pleasure from the pain.</br>Fair Smith beheld her haggard air,</br>At twilight as she wandered there,</br>And felt the sympathetic woe,</br>Which taste and genius ever know.</br>Eager she sought the listening throng,</br>To vindicate the force of song:</br>She chose an ode divinely wild,</br>Wrote by the muse's favourite child;</br>From COLLINS was the magic lay,</br>That subject passions all obey;</br>While she before th' attentive crowd,</br>Breathed the magic notes aloud;</br>Now sublimest triumph swelling,</br>Now on Love and Mercy dwelling,</br>Here Vengeance in the lucid air,</br>Lifts his red arm expos'd and bare:</br>On whom the ravening brood of fate,</br>Who lap the blood of sorrow wait.</br>Soft Pity next the poet drew,</br>In sky-worn robes of tenderest blue;</br>Pity, whose myrtle wand can steep,</br>E'en Anger's blood-shot eyes in sleep:</br>Before whose breathing bosom's balm,</br>Rage drops his steel, and storms grow calm;</br>Next gelid Fear, with eyes stretch'd wide,</br>Marks the mysterious spectre glide:</br>And as he stalks the haunted hall,</br>He flagging hears the phantom's call.</br>Anger, whose limbs of giant mould,</br>No mortal eye can fixed behold;</br>Next stalks his round, a hideous form,</br>Howling amidst the midnight storm;</br>And shrouds him in the haunted cell,</br>Where gloomy rage and murder dwell.</br>Next Love advanc'd, and joy and wonder,</br>Listening the deep applauding thunder;</br>And all the shadowy tribes of mind,</br>In braided dance their murmurs join'd;</br>And all the bright, uncounted powers,</br>Who feed on heaven's ambrosial flowers:</br>The crowd a varying influence prove,</br>Of rage, and hope, and fear, and love;</br>And bade the gentle maid rehearse,</br>And own'd the thrilling powers of verse.</br>O thou sweet bard!  who now mayest be,</br>A shadow fleeting o'er the sea,</br>A vapour on the morning rose,</br>A whispering wind at evening's close:</br>Or if thy spirit love to dwell,</br>Awhile within the violet's bell;</br>Then in beatitude of change,</br>From star to star exulting range;</br>Live in the lustre of the day,</br>Or float upon the lunar ray;</br>Or rapturous join the hallow'd voice,</br>Where endless seraphim rejoice.</br>O!  COLLINS!  whatso'er thou art,</br>To SMITH thy richest gifts impart!</br>A portion of those joys reveal,</br>Which sure she well deserves to feel.</br>Bid secret Malice blushing fly,</br>And Envy gorge her snakes and die;</br>Bid fortune's proudest gifts attend,</br>And fame, and joy, \"the Muse's friend.\"</br>"]
