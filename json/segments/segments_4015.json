["Near where yon brook flows thro' the dell,</br>From whose green bank those upland meadows swell;</br>See where the Rector's splendid mansion stands,</br>Embosom'd deep in new enclosed lands,</br>Lands, wrested from the indigent and poor,</br>Because, forsooth, he holds the village cure:</br>A man is he whom all his neighbours fear,</br>Litigious, haughty, greedy, and severe;</br>And starving with a thousand pounds a-year.</br>Midst crouds and sports he pass'd his youthful prime,</br>Retirement had with him been deem'd a crime;</br>When the young blood danc'd jocund through his veins,</br>'Tis said his sacred stole received some stains.</br>By doctrine fashion'd to the varying hour,</br>By friends, or fawning, he lays claim to pow'r;</br>For three fat livings own his goodly sway,</br>Two wretched curates starve upon his pay.</br>Celestial Charity, that heavenly guest,</br>Could ne'er find entrance to his close locked breast:</br>The common vagrants pass his well known gate,</br>With terrors hasty step, and looks of hate;</br>For well they know the suffering poor he mocks,</br>Their wants are promis'd, bridewell or the stocks:</br>The soldier seam'd with honourable scars,</br>The sailor hasting from his country's wars,</br>In vain to him may tell their wo-fraught tale,</br>Their wounds, their eloquence, may  not prevail;</br>Tho' by their valour, he in peace remains,</br>His heart withholds the mite to sooth the wanderers pains.</br>Thus to depress the wretched is his pride,</br>His seeming virtues are to vice allied;</br>Backward to duty, hateful to his ears</br>Sound the church bells to summon him to pray'rs,</br>And like the wolf that stole into the fold,</br>And slew the sheep in wooly vestments roll'd:</br>Still bent on gain, he watcheth night and day,</br>To rend and make God's heritage his prey.</br>Call'd to the bed where parting life is laid,</br>With what reluctance is the call obey'd;</br>A few brief pray'rs in haste he mutters o'er,</br>For time is precious, and the sick man poor;</br>Fancy e'en now depictures to his eye</br>Some neighbour's pigs forth issuing from the sty,</br>Whose wicked snouts his new-form'd banks uproot,</br>Close in the ditch, and lop the hawthorn shoot.</br>Full many a luckless hog, in morning round,</br>He drives, deep-grunting, to the starving pound;</br>When in the church, that venerable place,</br>A sullen frown o'erspreads his haughty face;</br>A preacher's frown conviction should impart,</br>But oft his smile should cheer the drooping heart.</br>He blunders through the pray'rs with hasty will&mdash;</br>A school-boy would be whipt who read so ill&mdash;</br>Then mounts the pulpit with an haughty mien,</br>Where more of pride than godliness is seen;</br>Some fifteen minutes his discourse will last,</br>And thus the business of the week is past.</br>The service past, no friendly rustics run</br>To shake his hand &mdash; his steps the children shun;</br>None for advice or comfort round him press,</br>Their joys would charm not, nor their cares distress;</br>To notice them they know he's all too proud,</br>His liv'ried lacqueys spurn the village crowd.</br>When for the mourner heav'd his breast the sigh?</br>When did compassion trickle from his eye?</br>Careless is he if weal or wo betide,</br>If dues and tithes be punctually supplied.</br>Such is the man blind chance, not God, hath giv'n,</br>To be the guide of humble souls to Heav'n;</br>To preach of Heav'n he'll sometimes condescend,</br>But all his views and wishes earthward tend.</br>Like a tall guide-post tow'ring o'er the way,</br>Whose letter'd arms the trav'llers route display,</br>Fix'd to one spot, it stands upon the down,</br>Its hand still pointing to the distant town.</br>"]
