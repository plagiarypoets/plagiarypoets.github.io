["How wretched the Maiden who loves</br>A Shepherd unworthy her care!</br>From Fair-one, to Fair-one who roves,</br>And whose Promise is lighter than Air!", "Such the Sorrows which poor PHILLIS knew,</br>Who COLIN too rashly believ'd;</br>His aim was to triumph o'er you,</br>Ah!  PHILLIS, unkindly deceiv'd!&mdash;", "Beneath the dark Cypress she lay,</br>And sigh'd her Complaint to the Wind</br>\"That her COLIN had wander'd away,</br>And left her despairing behind.\"", "All cold, and stretch'd out in the shade</br>By the Virgins, pale PHILLIS was found;</br>And a scroll on her bosom was laid,</br>Declaring, that Love gave the wound.&mdash;", "The Shepherds still speak of her Truth</br>As they point out her Grave with a sigh,</br>And upbraid thy inconstancy, Youth!</br>Who could suffer such Beauty to die.</br>"]
