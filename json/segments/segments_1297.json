["Hence, Summer, indolently laid</br>To sleep beneath the cooling shade!</br>Panting quick with sultry heat,</br>Thirst and faint fatigue retreat!", "Come, CHRISTMAS, father thou of mirth,</br>Patron of the festive hearth,</br>Around whose social ev'ning flame</br>The jovial song, the winter game,</br>The chase renew'd in merry tale,</br>The season's carols never fail.</br>Who, tho' the Winter chill the skies,</br>Canst catch the glow of exercise,</br>Following swift the foot-ball's course;</br>Or, with unresisted force,</br>Where frost arrests the harden'd tide,</br>Shooting 'cross the rapid slide.</br>Who, e'er the misty morn is grey,</br>To some high covert hark'st away;</br>While sport, on lofty courser borne,</br>In concert winds his echoing horn,</br>With the deeply-thund'ring hounds,</br>Whose clangour wild, and joyful sounds,</br>While echo swells the doubling cry,</br>Shake the woods with harmony.</br>How does my eager bosom glow,</br>To give the well-known tally-ho!</br>Or shew, with cap inverted, where</br>Stole away the cautious hare.</br>Or, if the blast of Winter keen</br>Spangles o'er the silvery green,</br>Booted high thou lov'st to tread</br>Marking, thro' the sedgy mead,</br>Where the creeping moor-hen lies,</br>Or snipes with sudden twitt'ring rise.</br>Or joy'st the early walk to take</br>Where thro' the pheasant-haunted brake</br>Oft as the well-aim'd gun resounds,</br>The eager-dashing spaniel bounds.", "For thee of buck my breeches tight,</br>Clanging whip, and rowels bright,</br>The hunter's cap my brows to guard,</br>And suit of sportive green's prepar'd:</br>For, since these delights are thine,</br>Christmas, with thy bands I join.</br>"]
