["The sons of business have appointed hours,</br>In which to show their various merchandise;</br>And whether heaven is gay or dark with showers,</br>The shivering shop-boy meets the passer's eyes</br>Opening at six; at weary eve, likewise,</br>The clock's obeyed; but Fancy doth not so:</br>Sometimes, all careless of th' inviting skies,</br>She dreams upon her couch, 'till Fortunes blow</br>Bids her awake, the world and all its scenes to know.", "Then doth she buckle her bright armour on,</br>And seize the magic circle of her shield,</br>Painted with dreams, and forms of actions gone,</br>And scattering doubtful light along the field:</br>Conscious where'er she steps the world must yield,</br>Her moody pranks are strange at first, and wild,</br>Till taught by falls and blows her arms to wield</br>No longer like a merry heedless child,</br>She walks where patient Art his landmarks true has piled.", "But whether she shall wake or late or soon,</br>Is left to Fortune, Nature hath not said;</br>Sometimes she walks in darkness, like the moon</br>When earth's dusk shadow o'er her face is spread;</br>But oftener still, like lamps among the dead,</br>Her light she lifts on high where none observe,</br>When, though the fiery radiance wide is shed,</br>The beauteous torch-bearer no end doth serve,</br>But gilds unheeding clay that leaves her lone to starve.", "But genius sometimes lingers in the rear</br>Of youth, and walks, a man, upon the stage</br>With giant port, and footstep void of fear,</br>And breast close-armed against the shafts of rage;</br>And like a mighty wrestler does engage</br>With stern renown, and bear away the prize</br>To grace his honoured brows when feeble age</br>Has damped his energy, and shrunk his size,</br>And dimmed the rays of soul that sparkled from his eyes.</br>"]
