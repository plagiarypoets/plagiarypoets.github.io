["O lovely Virgin!  thee, of yore</br>To manly sense, Good Humour bore;</br>Whom with the Wood-Nymphs he espied</br>Sporting on Ladona's flow'ry side,</br>Ere Pan had left th' Arcadian grove,</br>The seat of Innocence and Love!</br>There with the Graces didst thou stray,</br>Who, smitten with thy infant play,</br>Cloath'd thee in vest of purest white,</br>And crown'd with garlands of delight;</br>Till now, mature, with blushes chaste,</br>They gave thy willing hands to Taste:</br>He led thee to th' Aonian Mount,</br>Where, bathing in the sacred fount,</br>Thou sought'st with speed the hallowed quire</br>And heard'st with speed the hallowed quire</br>Each Muse attun'd her sweetest lays,</br>Intent to share thy heart-felt praise!", "O Goddess of the feeling mind!</br>To modest merit never blind!</br>Whose lips are ever slow to blame,</br>Whose warm applause is more than fame;</br>Whose pride it is, that work to spy</br>Unnotic'd by the vulgar eye;</br>To save from Error's partial gloom,</br>And bid desert its rank assume;</br>Whom Envy views with look malign,</br>And shrinking, owns thy power divine;</br>Whom hasty Censure's flippant train,</br>And bigot Spleen, assail in vain;</br>Before whom Malice stands confest,</br>Howe'er by Wit or Fancy drest;</br>O heed thy suppliant's humble pray'r!</br>Do thou, O Goddess!  still be near!</br>From Falsehood, and from Flattery free,</br>Still let my breast be warm with thee!</br>"]
