["Who would not wish a poet's holy name;&mdash;</br>Still more a poet's empire than his fame?</br>Ask ye the test that proves the genuine strain;&mdash;</br>If the tide flows from an undoubted vein?</br>Let the heart tell, if when the drink is first</br>In sparkling murmurs offer'd to the thirst,</br>The trembling glow its arteries attest;</br>And the brain fires, and swells the kindling breast!</br>If such the spell, tho' critics ply their taste,</br>And all their chymic arts in censure waste,</br>From fount of Helicon the stream proceeds,</br>And justly claims the poet's laureate meeds.</br>Not narrow is the poet's theme, nor bound</br>His means of pleasure to a narrow ground:</br>Rules, that would limit his excursive mind,</br>To forms of fiction, language, thought, confin'd,</br>Image or sentiment, or wandering flight</br>Of fancy in a phrenzy of delight,</br>Beholding shapes to mortal eyes unknown,</br>And maddening with creations of its own;</br>Morals that man, by nature's impress taught,</br>Deems by the hand of puff'd up Folly wrought;</br>Gorgeous invention of discordant things,</br>That shapes impossible together brings;&mdash;</br>Are rules like these the genius free to chain,</br>And bind to tasteless laws the poet's brain?</br>Not to the mighty range the eye surveys,</br>However beautiful are Nature's ways,</br>Is the Bard's theme restrain'd: &mdash; with equal joy</br>Th' invisible of mind his lays employ;</br>Thought is his empire; &mdash; every subtle ray</br>That loves upon the inmost soul to play,</br>'Tis his to paint; and every trembling dart,</br>That runs along the fibres of the heart,</br>Beyond the shapes of this material scene,</br>E'en when the Spring puts forth her emerald green;</br>Beyond the golden views of Summer's blaze;</br>Or gentler splendor of Autumnal days,&mdash;</br>Enchants fine reason's strain, to feeling join'd,</br>That lifts to loftier heights th' aspiring mind!</br>We live but in the mind:  material life</br>Is the base contest of a mortal strife;</br>Joy ending in ennui, disgust, regret,</br>And Grief in ambush where our hopes are set;</br>But mental pleasures stronger grow, the more</br>Th' indulging passion feeds upon the store;</br>And when the feast is done, &mdash; the moment past,&mdash;</br>Backward our eyes with fond delight we cast.</br>The forms that tire, &mdash; the scene of earthly mould,</br>That loses soon its charm as we behold,&mdash;</br>Must these in song delight us, yet the strain</br>The shadowy tribes of Intellect disdain?</br>Tribes, in whose converse ne'er the charm abates,</br>Nor pain, nor sorrow, nor repentance waits!</br>But wisdom, that our being's end and aim</br>Teaches to follow with an holy flame;</br>The bosom's movements, and the springs to know</br>Whence mystic man's recondite actions flow,</br>The hopes and fears, the secret joys, the pangs</br>With which the soul on some dread evil hangs,</br>Pierce the thick veil, and to the light of day</br>The mind's conflicting elements display.</br>Fruits of the genuine spring we seek in vain</br>In the wild whims of a distemper'd brain;</br>Hobgoblin imps, imagination draws,</br>In her forc'd freaks defying human laws;</br>Passions of monstrous fierceness, that demand</br>Admiring plaudits for the blood-stain'd hand;</br>Capricious will for reason's milder sway,&mdash;</br>The reckless chace of a delusive ray!", "Muses!  who sitting round the sacred spring</br>Of Helicon, your liquid incense fling</br>On votaries kneeling at your inmost shrine!</br>The gravest, deepest of these drops be mine!</br>To moral truths, to reason let me bow,</br>To nature, as she is, my studies vow!</br>Stern be the lesson, &mdash; plain and unadorn'd</br>The precept by whose light the world is warn'd!</br>But let its lofty tone, and breathing force,</br>Bespeak the sacred regions of its source!", "Nurs'd in the woods, from nature's voice I drew</br>The ceaseless fire that in my bosom grew;</br>And growing still in age's frozen clime,</br>Still bursts unblighted forth in fluent rhyme!</br>Shades of my Fathers, Wootton's spreading trees,</br>That fann'd my infant struggles by your breeze,</br>Ye taught me first to love the learned lore,</br>That mighty bards pour'd forth in days of yore;</br>On Milton's holiest song with rapture dwell,</br>And glow at tuneful Dryden's lyric shell!</br>With Shakespeare's fairy dreams, at evening hour,</br>To yield each wondering sense to Fancy's power;</br>And breathless view, at Spenser's magic calls,</br>Knights, arms, fair ladies, and enchanted halls!", "Apart I liv'd upon enchanted ground,</br>No worldly strife my hopes and joys to bound;</br>The clamour, and intrigue, and force, and art,</br>That damp the kindling ardors of the heart,</br>The fame, esteem, the wonder, and the praise,</br>That wait on wily deeds, and honied phrase,</br>Far from my haunts in woods, and meads, and vales,&mdash;</br>Ne'er reach'd my ear, nor mingled with my tales:</br>The world I saw was of the good and wise,</br>In books related, crown'd with virtue's prize!</br>When mid the throngs of elbowing mobs I fell,</br>No charm the tumults of my heart could quell:</br>My senses in the silence of retreat</br>Had learn'd no strength the noisy crews to meet:</br>Appal'd, o'erwhelm'd, they sunk in helpless gloom,</br>And Hope refus'd the future to illume.</br>Long was the darkness; many a weary year</br>Upon my fate obscure I drop'd the tear;</br>But broke at length from cells of black Despair,</br>And strove to wave my new-plum'd wings in air.</br>Then came the spring of life within my brain,</br>And op'd the regions of my former reign:</br>Imagination drew the mighty Dead</br>Up from the tomb to lift the palmy head,</br>And Virtue once again before my eyes</br>Began in her attractive glow to rise;</br>And Wisdom shone in beamy looks, and told</br>The lore that realms of future joy unroll'd!", "What are the wanton musings nurs'd by fools?</br>What is the jest, the fleeting hour that rules?</br>Will this frail life for ever last, and give</br>Time for all trifling tasks to those who live?</br>Ah, not a day has mortal man to spare!&mdash;</br>Let reason, truth, and knowlege be his prayer;</br>The moral lesson; &mdash; skill to scan the state</br>To which his being here is doom'd by fate,&mdash;</br>The talents, passions, whims of brother men;&mdash;</br>The movements that escape a hasty ken!&mdash;</br>To these alone the labours are confin'd,</br>That task a virtuous and a solid mind:&mdash;</br>Here is imagination's scope; &mdash; her light</br>Shews the deep secrets to the searching sight;</br>Shews all the subtlest workings of the breast;</br>Each throb that most beneath the veil is prest;</br>Each flying thought; each momentary aim;</br>The wish of honour, or the scheme of shame.</br>Not as the feeble fancy's vain conceit,</br>Not as proud labour, in factitious heat,</br>Would draw the picture of the scene of things,</br>Is the fair tale, from Helicon that springs!</br>Ah!  fairer far than toilsome Art can tell;&mdash;</br>More bright the visions of the Muse's well!&mdash;</br>Cold is the fiction, that the false pretence</br>Of empty bardlings offers to the sense:</br>Not to the eye the willing splendors rise,</br>Not to the heart a glow the verse supplies:</br>A waste of gorgeous words; &mdash; fantastic forms,</br>With which no vein of Nature's bosom warms!", "Of Bards most rich, most varied, most sublime,</br>Most tender, most intense, &mdash; whom ripening Time</br>Ne'er yet has equal'd, and will ne'er again</br>Reach in the height of Inspiration's strain,</br>Shakespeare, whose wand stretch'd o'er creation's range,&mdash;</br>Each outward, inward, shape, each subtle change!</br>Thou didst not seek, by tales which Truth disclaims,</br>To fill the wondering breast with childish flames!</br>The happiest notes of thy enchanting lyre,</br>Most touch'd by every Muse's purest fire,</br>True to each feature, shape, and tint, and shade,</br>Are nature's voice in nature's form array'd!", "Each step that we from Nature's likeness part,</br>Shews the weak efforts of a sickly art!</br>There is no strain but Truth's, the wise can hear;</br>There is no voice but Nature's, charms the ear:</br>All else is wasting on an idle theme</br>Hours, we too late must struggle to redeem!", "Strange is frail man's existence; grief and joy</br>And vice and virtue mingled form th'alloy;</br>When if the good alone could have its sway,</br>Earth would a perfect Paradise display.</br>Rapture is in the sight of hills and vales,</br>And woods and meads, and Ocean spread with sails,</br>And mountain-tops by rosy suns array'd,</br>And golden lights that billowy clouds pervade:</br>And rapture in the sound, when Nature's voice</br>Begins at the reviving Spring rejoice:</br>The low of herds, the bleat of lambs, the song</br>Of birds that in the opening foliage throng;</br>And when the falling leaf, all pale and sere,</br>Bemoans in gentle sounds the dying year;</br>And when from Summer clouds the lightning breaks,</br>And Winter's roaring storm in thunder speaks;</br>Rapture to all, in whom nor vice nor art</br>Has crush'd the simple movements of the heart!", "Ye Muses, sitting round the heavenly throne,</br>With harps all strung to a celestial tone,</br>Ye, when the great Creator's word gave birth,</br>Pois'd in mid air, to this great globe of Earth</br>Struck up with echoing hand your notes of praise,</br>Till Heav'n's whole concave trembled with the lays!</br>Ye, who thus sung its primal being, wait</br>With anxious hearts upon its passing state!</br>'Tis yours to teach the favour'd few, whose toils,</br>By worship pure inspir'd, have won your smiles;</br>To sing this work of the Creator's hand,</br>Such as it started forth at his command!</br>No struggle vain still fairer hues to throw,</br>And make its skies with brighter gold to glow;</br>Mankind to cast in moulds of heavenlier form,</br>And souls with more celestial fire to warm!</br>Enough, vain Bard, enough, that man should be</br>Such as he came on earth by heaven's decree!</br>"]
