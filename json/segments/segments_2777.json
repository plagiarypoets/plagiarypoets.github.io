["Sweet buxom Nymph, a foe to Care</br>To Sorrow, Grief, and black Despair,</br>And form'd to give delight;</br>With blooming Fancy by thy side,</br>And Wit, proud as an eastern bride,</br>Where splendor strikes the sight;", "Oh, thou that fir'st the Poet's page,</br>And deck'st the writings of the Sage,</br>With sprightly Attic grace;</br>Sweet Chearfulness!  where dost thou dwell?</br>In valley, grove, or mossy cell,</br>Where shall I meet thy face?", "What!  shall I climb the mountain's brow?</br>And dauntless view the vale below,</br>Unaw'd by pallid Fear;</br>Sweet Goddess!  strike thy airy lyre</br>With all thy force and native fire,</br>And I will listen there.", "The wretch, who o'er the midnight bowl</br>Absorbs the feelings of his soul,</br>And roves from Reason's way,</br>When lost amid the sweets of wine,</br>May think his boisterous mirth is thine,</br>And all his wit display.", "Or he, who wrapt in robes of state,</br>Possessing all the smile of Fate,</br>Vain transitory gleam!</br>He too may think t' enjoy thy charms,</br>But clasps a phantom in his arms,</br>He 'wakes &mdash; 'tis but a dream.", "If right I ween, thou lov'st the vale,</br>To listen to the shepherd's tale,</br>And soothe the pangs of life;</br>In sweet Contentment's mossy cell,</br>With happy swains thou lov'st to dwell,</br>Far from the haunts of strife.", "The Elves, the guardians of the night,</br>Shall hear thy music with delight,</br>And listen to thy song;</br>Oft shall they through the valley stray,</br>Brushing the pearly dew away,</br>And dance the evening long.", "Sweet Nature's charms, the blooming spring,</br>When high in air the lark shall sing,</br>Celestial Maid!  are thine;</br>Led by the healthful breeze of morn,</br>The sportsman, with his echoing horn,</br>Shall gambol at thy shrine.", "And if thy temple rears its head,</br>Where shady oaks their foliage spread,</br>The Druid's sacred tree;</br>Then, gentle Nymph, thy airy dome</br>Shall ever be my peaceful home,</br>And I will dwell with thee.</br>"]
