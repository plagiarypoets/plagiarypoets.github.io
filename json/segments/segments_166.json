["Thenot my deare, how can a lofty hill</br>To lowly shepherds thoughts be rightly fitting?</br>An humble dale well fits with humble quill:</br>There may I safely sing, all fearlesse sitting,</br>My Fusca's eyes, my Fusca's beauty dittying;</br>My loved lonenesse, and hid Muse enjoying:</br>Yet should'st thou come, and see our simple toying,</br>Well would fair Thenot like our sweet retired joying.", "But if my Thenot love my humble vein,</br>(Too lowly vein) ne're let him Colin call me;</br>He, while he was, was (ah!)  the choicest swain,</br>That ever grac'd a reed:  what e're befall me,</br>Or Myrtil, (so 'fore Fusca fair did thrall me,</br>Most was I know'n) or now poore Thirsil name me,</br>Thirsil, for so my Fusca pleases frame me:</br>But never mounting Colin; Colin's high stile will shame me.", "Two shepherds I adore with humble love;</br>Th' high-towring swain, that by slow Mincius waves</br>His well-grown wings at first did lowly prove,</br>Where Corydon's sick love full sweetly raves;</br>But after sung bold Turnus daring braves:</br>And next our nearer Colin's sweetest strain;</br>Most, where he most his Rosalind doth plain.</br>Well may I after look, but follow all in vain.", "Why then speaks Thenot of the honour'd Bay?</br>Apollo's self, though fain, could not obtain her;</br>She at his melting songs would scorn to stay,</br>Though all his art he spent to entertain her:</br>Wilde beasts he tam'd, yet never could detain her.</br>Then sit we here within this willow glade:</br>Here for my Thenot I a garland made</br>With purple violets, and lovely myrtil shade.</br>"]
