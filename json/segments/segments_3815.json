["Take quantum sufficit of meadows and trees,</br>While your zephyrs most wantonly play in each breeze;</br>Let Phoebus and Flora together combine,</br>To make the sky smile, and the meadows look fine.</br>Your nymphs and your swains must be sorted in pairs;</br>Your swains should be love-sick, your nymphs be all fairs:</br>Let them prattle awhile, as their hay they are tedding;</br>Then wind up the whole with a church and a wedding.</br>But if grief elegiac you'd wish to assail,</br>Your prospect must lour, your swains must look pale:</br>Let Damon ask Corydon why droops his head;</br>If his Celia's unkind, or his lambkins are dead.</br>\"No!\" let him reply, \"'tis not this gives me pain;</br>But young Colin is dead, the delight of the plain!\"</br>Then let him invoke skies, angels, and saints,</br>Trees, meadows, and riv'lets, to join their complaints:</br>Till Damon, to ease him, and end these sad cries,</br>Assures him that Colin has mounted the skies.</br>From this kind assurance his mind is at ease,</br>And they hie to their cottage &mdash; to eat bread and cheese.</br>"]
