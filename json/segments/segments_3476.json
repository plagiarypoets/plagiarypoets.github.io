["How happy a state does the Rustick enjoy</br>Whose breast with contentment e'er glows,</br>A stranger to bustle, no cares to annoy,</br>His time with sweet harmony flows.", "No thoughts to perplex or to ruffle his mind,</br>No cares but his Nelly to please;</br>Contented he laughs at the storms or the wind,</br>For his breast's ever calm and at ease.", "He gaily gets up with the Lark in the morn</br>And away to the field briskly hies,</br>To plow, or to sow, or to cut down his corn,</br>Whilst mirth ever beams in his eyes.", "Thus, with pleasure he passes the gay circling year,</br>Whilst each day with contentment is crown'd,</br>And at night, with a noggin of brown nappy beer,</br>They quaff it so merrily round.", "Or at even, with pleasure, his work being done,</br>He trips to the village I ween,</br>Where the Lads and the Lasses are jovially gone</br>To enjoy the gay dance on the green.", "Or with joy, to the wake, with his Nell doth repair,</br>Smartly deck'd in his holiday vest;</br>Or when with her at harvest-home, shearing, or fair,</br>Sure no villager e'er was more blest.", "Then search city or town, 'tis but bustle and strife,</br>There grandeur and wealth may abound;</br>But health, peace and contentment, the true joys of life,</br>In the cot are alone to be found.</br>"]
