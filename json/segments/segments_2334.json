["Hail to those sacred mansions great and high!</br>Methinks a glory near each chapel dwells,</br>Christ's colours streaming there of crimson dye;</br>Each offering like the balm of Gilead smells,</br>Which mixt with odorous gums all meaner scents dispels.", "Lord, on each holy pile each house of prayer,</br>Open still open be thy gracious eyes!</br>Bow down thine ear, be there thy special care;</br>Who after sun-set, and before sun-rise,</br>Those benedictions ask, thy bounty ne'er denies.", "Let thy good angels still the place frequent;</br>Send from thy treasures of coelestial grace,</br>Those gifts thy holy spirit oft has sent;</br>Send them, blest Father, on that chosen place,</br>Lift up thy light serene on those that seek thy face.", "Thou badst the heavenly meteor take its stand,</br>Over thy travailing temple in the way;</br>Where Moses led them through the barren sand;</br>As thou wert in that meteor, so I pray</br>Through younder sacred roofs dart thine inspiring ray:", "And thou that didst an orient cloud prepare,</br>To fill that house which fill'd the mouth of fame,</br>What day 'twas hallowed by its founder's prayer;</br>Greater than Solomon thou art the same</br>To shine on those that still invoke thy glorious name.", "Whoever there shall thee, dread Lord, adore,</br>And beg thy pardon with a broken heart;</br>Prostrate upon the consecrated floor,</br>That pardon they implore do thou impart,</br>Every disease from thence and every plague divert.", "All who are there with thy blest body fill'd,</br>And with thy precious blood, good angels fare,</br>To them against the foe be thou a shield,</br>They thine own servants, thy sworn servants are,</br>Let them in endless joys in endless glory share.", "Son of the Father, who the world didst frame,</br>And didst redeem the world with thine own blood,</br>And tak'st away our sin, O thou the Lamb,</br>To that blest colony of thine be good,</br>Wash them from earth for heaven in thy rich purple flood.</br>"]
