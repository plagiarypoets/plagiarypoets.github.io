["How dear to roam along the sunny hills,</br>When Autumn spreads her bounties on the plain;</br>When Industry his garner'd treasure fills</br>With richest stores from fields of ripen'd grain;</br>When slow across the fields the ponderous wain,</br>Deep laden with the yellow ears, is drawn,</br>While from wide trees, that overhand the lane,</br>The ripe red apples, shaden down at dawn,</br>Lie scatter'd thick and far along the level lawn.", "The winding rill along the sunny vale</br>Sings its sweet song to cheer the reaper's heart;</br>And oft its voice the pensive autumn gale</br>Will join, and cause the rustling leaves to start;</br>While scores of screaming blackbirds bear their part,</br>With varied notes, yet full of melody;</br>And troops of noisy boys, with dog and cart,</br>Are hasting to the hills with youthful glee,</br>To shake the clustering nuts from the tall walnut tree.", "But soon this beauteous pageantry shall fail,</br>And every mellow tint of Autumn fade;</br>A melancholy murmur fills the gale,</br>And sorrow saddens o'er the yellowing glade;</br>Through thickening clouds the suns of autumn wade,</br>And beauty sits upon the hills no more;</br>The verdure of the wood is prostrate laid,</br>And soon the autumn rains begin to pour,</br>And down the craggy rocks the swelling torrents roar.", "Such is the fortune of majestic man!</br>The leaves of fragrance round his forehead flow,</br>The laureate wreath, that gales of fortune fan,</br>For which he climbed so high or stooped so low;</br>But soon approach the tempest clouds of wo,</br>To mar the beauty of his brightest deed;</br>Yet while he mourns his fortune's overthrow,</br>He looks to heaven for some more glorious mead;&mdash;</br>Thus to the autumn winds I tune my Dorick reed.</br>"]
