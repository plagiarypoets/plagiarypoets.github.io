["Young Chloe's as gay as the Spring,</br>But will change like an April Day;</br>As rich as the Summer &mdash; dear Thing,</br>And will frolic like Lambkins in MAY.", "She's truly good-natur'd and meek,</br>If you catch her but when she's in Tune,</br>And if for her Virtues you seek,</br>They are bright as the Roses in JUNE.", "The Flowers of JULY can't compare</br>To the Fragrance that hangs on her Lip,</br>Nor the Plenty of AUGUST declare</br>The Nectar that thence one might sip.", "SEPTEMBER'S fine Fruits are more scarce</br>Than the Fruits of her elegant Mind;</br>The bright Beer of OCTOBER'S a Farce</br>To this the most bright of her Kind.", "Yet NOVEMBER'S dull Fogs hang about her,</br>And she'll make the poor Devil remember,</br>Who finds he cannot live without her,</br>That her Heart is as cold as DECEMBER.</br>"]
