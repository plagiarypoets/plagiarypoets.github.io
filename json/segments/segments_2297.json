["The glowing arch, that crowns the passing storm,</br>And sooths the angry thunders as they rise,</br>Lifts o'er the watry cloud its lovely form,</br>And sheds its glory o'er the bending skies,</br>With radiance caught from Heaven, but quick receding dies.", "The eye that loves to view its dazzling rays,</br>And rove with rapture o'er its melting grades,</br>And glad prolong its unabating gaze,</br>Yet strives in vain to mark the varying shades,</br>Where one soft tint begins, and where a softer fades.", "So shines the path of virtue, bright and fair,</br>With gentle traces, and soft blending lines,</br>Her train of duties scarcely shewing where,</br>One woos the soul, or one her charge resigns,</br>'Till in a stream of light, the finish'd glory shines.</br>"]
