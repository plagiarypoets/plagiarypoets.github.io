["Shrink not! &mdash; we have not learned</br>Those glowing terms to use</br>Which the weak love, unearned;</br>But noble minds refuse.</br>Proudly we woo the muse;</br>And proudly we despise</br>The craven soul which views</br>The Aonian mount, and cries</br>Humbly, on all who pass, for a little help to rise.", "Shrink not! &mdash; for thou hast won</br>A name that will not fade:</br>And vainly were it done</br>Another wreath to braid,</br>Than thy simple one, arrayed</br>With the flowers of heart and mind;</br>Which, when gaudier sink in shade&mdash;</br>When the tinsel all is tined,</br>Will be honoured by the good, will be cherished by the kind.", "Oh!  little do we deem</br>Of the gifted spirit's light,</br>If it live but as the beam</br>Which flashes but to smite.</br>And if ever, from the height</br>Of the jealous bosom's pride,</br>We would stoop, it were to write</br>Our homage where abide</br>Genius and generous thoughts in one warm heart allied.", "As little should we reck</br>Of laud and favour given</br>When through all gloom and check</br>Unaided we had striven;</br>Which, when the cloud was riven,</br>And our feet were on the hill,</br>Would welcome us to heaven,</br>With beams which could not thrill,</br>When our sojourn was below, and our very souls were chill.", "Such was not thy first greeting,</br>Thou friend unseen, yet dear!</br>'Twas when our light was fleeting</br>Before the critic's sneer,</br>That our names unto thine ear</br>Became a living sound;</br>And thy spirit, with a cheer</br>Which the cynic's whining drowned,</br>Shouted welcome to our feet upon fancy-haunted ground.", "Then, as we launch once more</br>Our shallop on the sea</br>Of fame, whose rocks and roar</br>Are safely passed by thee,</br>We will echo back with glee</br>Thy soul's unchanging tone:</br>And our light skiff, &mdash; let it be</br>Tossed, battered, rent, and blown,</br>So it win us from the world but one true heart like thine own.</br>"]
