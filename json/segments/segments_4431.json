["Hail happy Village, hail that sacred grove,</br>Where EMMA'S blushes bloom'd in HENRY'S love,</br>Where NEWTON studied, where th' immortal Bard,</br>Miltonick struck the grand inspiring chord,</br>Soaring to Heav'n, immeasurable span,</br>Paints the once bliss, portrays the fall of man.</br>Hail happy tenant of yon rural shade,</br>Ye fields, ye bow'rs, for contemplation made,</br>Where the high tow'ring lordly manor seat</br>Looks down on all, to give to all retreat;</br>Where lofty oaks in rude umbrageous form</br>Shelter the castle, and defy the storm:</br>In palaces like these e'en Monarchs reign'd,</br>Securely slept, and Angels entertain'd,</br>Till restless beings, covetous of store,</br>Fathom'd the mine, and grasp'd the precious ore;</br>Contentment barter'd for dissembling gold,</br>The wolf was left to prey upon the fold;</br>Cities were built, meek virtue went astray,</br>And vice eclips'd the sunshine of the day.</br>Still happy seat of innocence and ease,</br>Of harmless frolick, and of lasting peace;</br>Thy rural shades the rural mind invites,</br>And Nature dictates what the heart indites;</br>No din of war, no thirst of pow'r alarms,</br>And British freedom Britain's subjects warms.</br>Thus, when at dawn th' accustom'd carols ring,</br>Hodge smiling whistles, Long live GEORGE the King.</br>Sorrows unknown, save when at ev'ning close,</br>Sad Philomela tunes her midnight woes;</br>Tunes sweet distresses to remind the best,</br>That nought on earth makes man completely blest.</br>Yet calm as th' infant rock'd, no cries awake,</br>When reason leads us thro' life's thorny brake,</br>When unexampl'd virtue gains renown,</br>When vice can lay each bright temptation down.</br>Hark!  where beneath the summit of yon hill,</br>The reed sonorous to the purling rill,</br>Palemon tunes love's animating strain,</br>The cattle browsing on the verdant plain</br>Listen attentive, and the tinkling flock,</br>Quit the cool shelter of the stony rock.</br>Lull'd with chaste harmony th' inspired breeze</br>Forbore to ruffle e'en the poplar trees,</br>Save that which echo gave the trembling leaf,</br>Thus princely honour'd was Pan's rustick Chief.</br>But ah!  what strain describe, what language aid,</br>Collina's charms, Feronia's dove-ey'd maid:</br>She, while Palemon nurs'd the silver fold,</br>Sweet child of love, felt all the God foretold;</br>Her crook with blossoms wild was studded o'er,</br>Knots of white ribbon wove the hedge-blown flow'r,</br>Her cheeks like roses unimpair'd by time,</br>Her lips like Kentish cherries in their prime:</br>Her bosom heav'd a sigh, was heard to stray,</br>Collina vanquish'd, sudden swoon'd away.</br>Love too she sang, so pure the virgin drest,</br>That e'en the Robin plum'd his crimson breast;</br>Her words like flakes of milk-white feather'd snow,</br>Melted as falling on the neighb'ring bough.</br>To Nature's warblers what must mankind owe?</br>Tell me, Collina, thou alone canst know.</br>No parents here their dread commands impose,</br>But where love dictates, love resigns the rose.</br>Together train'd the fleecy charge to tend,</br>Virtues triumphant grace the bosom friend;</br>Love ever pure in infancy began,</br>The spark increasing till it blaz'd in man.</br>No village Fair Palemon's love supplants,</br>He nothing covets, and she nothing wants,</br>Wash'd by the rosy goddess blooming Health,</br>The bearded product golden gives them wealth.</br>Palemon rears the cot, 'gainst winds prepare,</br>While the sock lamb is fair Collina's care.</br>Nor woe they knew, save what the lambkin told,</br>When stray'd by chance, a bleat disturbs the fold.</br>At sight of her the lowing herd would speed,</br>To pay their tribute for the daisy'd mead;</br>Rob'd in her laylock skirt and primrose vest,</br>No courtly beauty more divinely drest:</br>Tho' Sunday clad, Collina not too fine</br>To pen the flock, to milk the yielding kine,</br>Hoard the rich treasure of th' industrious bee,</br>Palemon Shepherd, Shepherdess was she;</br>Palemon placid, never thought amiss</br>When he beheld a larger crop than his.</br>Vain sprouts the corn, still vain the burthen'd store,</br>If bless'd abundance makes us wish for more;</br>But if content, how mild, how calm thy ray,</br>How pure the thought, how happy shines the day&mdash;</br>Mark where the bush sweet Maia speaks the spring,</br>The timid bird essays the tender wing,</br>Bursting in glory o'er the pregnant earth,</br>To feed the sap, give vegetation birth;</br>Sol splendid rose his daily course to run,</br>The twig to paint, that bows to meet the sun.</br>The grateful glebe like olive green the shoot,</br>The bloom the orchard speaks the promis'd fruit.</br>In mazy windings wand'ring down the hill,</br>The crystal brook supplies the neighb'ring mill;</br>The verdant meads with modest cowslips crown'd,</br>The vi'lets purpled shed their odours round;</br>The full milch'd ewe the yellow'd fields adorn,</br>The full-blown fence now seems to bleach the thorn.</br>The thrush melodious courts the latent briar,</br>The songsters woodland join the rural quire;</br>Thrice happy spot to contemplation dear,</br>Like charming May you charm us all the year.&mdash;</br>Lo!  where the hamlets ivy'd Gothick tow'r,</br>With merry peals salute th' auspicious hour,</br>With sounds that thro' the chearful village bear,</br>The happy union of some wedded pair;</br>The modest look forbade a thought to sin,</br>Without how lovely, lovelier still within;</br>The vestal zone which bound her slender waist,</br>With valley'd lilies fair Aminta grac'd.</br>The wedding cake slow thro' the ring was led,</br>The stocking thrown across the nuptial bed.</br>The wheaten ear was scatter'd near the porch,</br>The green broom blossom'd strew'd the way to church.</br>Now Sunday come, at stated hour of prayer,</br>Or rain or shine, the happy couple there.</br>Where nymphs and swains in various colours dight,</br>Gave pleasing contrast to the modest white.</br>Yet early taught when for the Temple drest,</br>The plainer garb became the Damsel best.</br>Peerless in native innocence array'd,</br>The Bridegroom led the newly-brided Maid.</br>The constant village follow'd debonair,</br>Perfection knew not she was half so fair&mdash;</br>Behold yon Elms that grace the sacred road!</br>High rais'd, that leads to God's sublime abode.</br>The Church, bless'd mansion of serene delight,</br>Where groves of yew obstruct the hallow'd sight.</br>Spreading lone shelter to the solemn gloom,</br>Shedding their crimson'd berries on the tomb;</br>The cooling breeze on lofty Alders play'd,</br>The nodding Cyprus form'd the holy shade.</br>With reverential awe, and look select,</br>The broad-brimm'd beaver e'er commands respect.</br>Envy in vain could his perfections taint,</br>So liv'd on earth, he sure were born a saint;</br>Not ev'n a Stoick dare his virtues scan:</br>A truly rev'rend, and religious man.</br>His words attention every where diffus'd,</br>Foster'd the good, the bad alone accus'd:</br>His soul with honest zeal was daily arm'd,</br>His precepts cherish'd, and his virtues warm'd;</br>His doctrine such as practice soundly wrought,</br>Himself an image of the truths he taught.</br>He bore Heav'n's great commission in his look;</br>The tithe demands, but ne'er the poor forsook.</br>Settled disputes, what little had to spare,</br>He gave t' increase want's solitary fare.&mdash;</br>See where the village rang'd in comely row,</br>With hat in hand, and bowing humbly low,</br>The Squire attend until he comes to church,</br>Silent they stand, encircled round the porch.</br>Not that they ever for his Worship wait,</br>He knows the time, and never comes too late.</br>The service o'er, the health enquires of all,</br>And our good Vicar dines at Felix Hall.&mdash;</br>Next morn I ween the village charter'd Fair,</br>A day that's ne'er forgot throughout the year:</br>Soon as the lark expands her auburn fan,</br>Foretelling day, before the day began,</br>Then Jehu Ball, re-echos down the lane,</br>Crack goes the whip, and rattling sounds the chain.</br>With tinkling bells the stately beast grown proud,</br>Champs on the bit, and neighing roars aloud.</br>The bridles dotted o'er with many a flow'r,</br>The six team'd waggon forms a leafy bow'r;</br>Young Damon whistled to Dorinda's song,</br>The fiddle tuneful play'd the time along.</br>At length arriv'd, the statute fills the Fair,</br>Dorcas and Lydia, Bella too was there:</br>Favours and gauzes, variegated gay,</br>Punch loudly squeaks, the drum proclaims the play.</br>The pole high rear'd, the dance, the gambol, shew'd</br>Mirth and diversion to the gaping crowd:</br>Sam with broad smile, and Poll with dimpled face,</br>Revers'd the apron, shews she wants a place.</br>The race in sacks, the quoit, the circling reel,</br>While Prue more thoughtful buys a spinning wheel.</br>The grinning Andrew perch'd on folly's stool,</br>Proves th' artificial, not the natural fool.</br>For Hodge declares he thinks, devoid of art,</br>He must be wise, who acts so well his part!&mdash;</br>View now the vet'ran father of the fold!</br>By Temp'rance nurs'd, one hundred years had told.</br>A British soldier pious, prone to please,</br>Retired here to end his days in peace:</br>Soon as he came to join the jocund throng,</br>A lane was form'd through which he march'd along.</br>Shoulder'd his stick, with upright gait he led,</br>The many follow'd to King William's head:</br>For he himself, had for King William bled.</br>But yet with him, not deem'd a welcome guest,</br>Unless forbearance dwelt within his breast:</br>This wholesome precept was enforc'd to all,</br>The Squire put down each other place of call;</br>For if o'erta'en, the Vicar sure would chide,</br>As such, his Worship suffer'd none beside:</br>Th' landlord knew his task without being bid,</br>The beer high laughing overflow'd the lid,</br>His pipe he smok'd, drank to King George's health,</br>Despising all the luxury of wealth,</br>Observe he said, This day I shall command!&mdash;</br>Th' attentive Peasant wond'ring took his stand:</br>While on an oaken table smear'd with beer,</br>Trac'd with his pipe, the center, front, and rear,</br>Brandish'd his staff, display'd each honor'd scar,</br>And eager told whate'er he knew of war.</br>The siege describ'd, the memorable plain,</br>And zealous fought each battle o'er again.</br>Now ready shew'd where he in ambush lay,</br>Tempting the fortune of some doubtful day;</br>Here then he cried!  see there the open heath!</br>Where brazen trumpets rang the peal of death.</br>Here, though surrounded, Britain scorn'd to yield,</br>And thunder'd through the tempest of the field.</br>Vaunting so number'd those in battle slain,</br>Time seem'd disbanded, youth restor'd again:</br>Sudden now palsied shook his hoary head,</br>And wept to think how many brave lay dead.</br>Sorely lamented o'er another can,</br>That honor's purchas'd by the blood of man.</br>He paus'd, retreated from the well known shore,</br>The barren road grown fat with human gore.</br>Yet to one cause exclaim'd all battles tend:</br>The world's an inn, and death the journey's end.&mdash;</br>&mdash;Lo brumal ev'ning not to feasts obscene,</br>The rural tribe their rural race convene;</br>The cricket chirps; the pantomimic ray,</br>Diverts with Giant strides the fabled way,</br>The long mile shortens, while the length'ned tale,</br>Grows rich in fancy, as the shades prevail;</br>The glow worm's spangles spot the fairied road,</br>That leads to Virtue's ever bless'd abode:</br>While Cynthia pale reveals the plighted blush,</br>Wheels her wan course, and frolicks round the bush.</br>Happy alike when Summer's solar ray,</br>Converts the ripen'd grass to wither'd hay;</br>When the cool stream soft murm'ring rolls her wave,</br>Silver'd invites her wanton sons to lave;</br>Or 'neath some shady damask'd vale retreat,</br>Where jess'mine arbors scent the moss-grown seat;</br>Where fragrant suckles weave their lengthen'd bine,</br>Where briar'd sweets with roseate sweets intwine.</br>Glad'ning the morn, to pleasing tales invite,</br>Grateful vicissitude of day and night;</br>Or when autumnal joys enrich the field,</br>And golden products golden harvests yield;</br>Here scarce a weed among the corn is found,</br>So cultur'd well this little spot of ground:</br>Or when the Squire's known huntsman wakes the morn</br>With hollow shrill, or more enliv'ning horn;</br>With stern erect when Snowball snuffs the air,</br>Drags on the Fox, or finds the circling Hare;</br>Or when old Pero hunts beneath the copse,</br>Or Doll more daring, in the clover stops;</br>Each proud to shew the Squire what sport they can,</br>Hob marks the bird, and Ralph the chafe had ran.</br>No din was heard of strict manorial right,</br>His wish their pleasure, their's was his delight.</br>When he appear'd no tongue their joy could tell,</br>Happy to see, to hear, his Honor's well.</br>Meanwhile at home blithe innocently gay,</br>Papa's own image, skips the time away.</br>Diversions manlike press his feeble mind,</br>Acts as he acts, and as he thinks inclin'd.</br>If left to choose, a horse becomes his choice,</br>This he prefers to all his other toys;</br>In hopes e'er long a sportsman to become,</br>Rides on a stick, and travels sound the room.</br>Till tir'd at length, and having ran his course,</br>Down goes at once the rider and his horse;</br>Some ridge the carpet, or some fatal shred,</br>Mishap had thrown young master o'er his head.&mdash;</br>Still happy village, when bleak Winter's blast,</br>Makes mankind thankful for the seasons past;</br>When fields and groves, no longer form'd to cheer,</br>The rude, tho' thoughtful ev'ning of the year.</br>Yet the glad Peasant innocent of ills,</br>With studious care the fertile fallow tills:</br>The well stock'd market reaps from hence supplies,</br>The pamper'd earth resigns her hidden prize.</br>While born to labour the more aged swain,</br>Example gives to all the youthful train.</br>He good old man had never learn'd to roam,</br>His longest journey ne'er five miles from home;</br>Hoary with age he breath'd his native air,</br>Nor wish imbib'd beyond his elbow chair.</br>Daily the lessons and the collect read,</br>At ev'ning chimes the trembling taper led;</br>Nor yet forgot his long lov'd annual feast,</br>The Pilgrim's Progress, once a year at least.</br>The mind carousing no fond thought invades,</br>To break the calm that lulls her peaceful shades.</br>But orient like, the daily labour done,</br>All golden rises with the setting sun;</br>Which tho' fast shelving o'er yon snow topt hill,</br>Gives all the warmth more genial climes instil:</br>Though Heav'n's great lamp declines his brighter rays,</br>Love crowns the night, and shortens winter days.</br>No humours here infest the purer blood,</br>No dreams, sole cause of more voluptuous food,</br>That rend the curtains of the damask bed,</br>The restless case by dark intemp'rance fed.</br>But the meek housewife adds with prudent strife,</br>To nature's charms, what most embellish life:</br>She matron form'd each rural joy to crown,</br>Softness superior to the bed of down;</br>To teach by sweet example's sov'reign sway,</br>Her Girls to sew, her Boys to earn their play;</br>To teach that toil alone can still the grief,</br>Without the pain of asking for relief.</br>Train'd by her hand the Perecanther spread,</br>Mantling the casement with its cluster'd red:</br>The 'kerchief pinn'd, the modest cap put on,</br>The needle threaded, rural duty done:</br>The redden'd brick, the clean wash'd sanded door,</br>The lusty bantling, grappling on the floor.</br>The dreaming lurcher stretch'd before the fire,</br>Driving the game to meet the destin'd wire;</br>Runs the bare path the harmless sheep had made,</br>Now sprung the snare, now darting thro' the glade;</br>Brushes the slope, ascends the craggy rock,</br>Wakes the still musick of the slumb'ring flock;</br>With quiv'ring limb pursues the tim'rous flight,</br>As shock'd at deeds that shun the glare of light;</br>Wreathing the neck, sore grinds the fated prize,</br>Then licks the wound by which the victim dies:</br>While o'er his back Grimalkin's am'rous play,</br>Foretells, tho' fair, to-morrow's rainy day.</br>And haughty Mag by all the vale confest,</br>Undaunted struts a robber from the nest:</br>Raps at the coop, disturbs the speckled Queen,</br>The choice Sultana, Lady of the Green;</br>Peep'd though the chamber of her pregnant wing,</br>The feather'd promise of the early spring:</br>T' engage prepar'd the ruffled Partlet stood,</br>Screening the fondling of her latter brood;</br>The comb grew coral, and the pointed spear,</br>Arms the mail'd heel, half rais'd to guard the rear.</br>Like when a charger for the battle strong,</br>Disdains the curb to force the ranks along;</br>Th' eye streak'd with blood 'gainst th' adverse army neighs,</br>Bristles the mane, and all the line surveys;</br>Flaming with ire the scarlet nostrils blow,</br>Spurns the plough'd sand, and vaults to meet the foe.</br>The crested Heroine thus with sudden bound,</br>With hollow sounding pinion scores the ground:</br>The breast in discord bath'd and pent with rage,</br>Bursts thro' the railing of the ozier cage:</br>At length th' assistant vanquish'd, sprawling lay,</br>And left the Dame sole empress of the day.</br>With conscious preference now, and haughty stride,</br>She calls the youthier, perking by her side;</br>To where again, within the wicker space,</br>The crowing lineage court the warm embrace,</br>Where constant near the chimney corner fed,</br>With crumbs that fell from off the children's bread.</br>Here our own Susan daily told her gain,</br>Proud of the splendor of her milk white train.</br>But lo!  extinguish'd light's pale shiv'ring ray,</br>Clos'd the last remnant of the wearing day;</br>O'er the dark concave world's illumin'd glow,</br>Bright'ning the forehead of the Negro brow:</br>Snarling the cur steals sneaking to his watch,</br>To greet his master posted near the latch;</br>And the fond mother not less anxious sate,</br>To catch the wearied whistle at the gate:</br>The clock to count, that in the parlour clicks,</br>To hear the cuckoo sing the hour of six:</br>Then blames the mimic bird's deceiving cry,</br>The bird that told, what she detests, a lie.</br>For had not fleeting time's revolving stroke</br>Whirl'd the brass axle of the rolling spoke.</br>Pattern of truth, e'er now Tray's steady tongue,</br>Climbing the bank, had thro' the welkin rung;</br>Still where domestick care the hours employ,</br>The moment's trouble yields a certain joy.</br>When pleasing heard the well known tread approach</br>The pot has boil'd, the kilderkin abroach:</br>When wing'd she flies to see if she can trace</br>The new-born joy that plaits his honest face;</br>The sav'ry oven's wholesome banquet spread,</br>Which the rich golden neighb'ring fields had fed:</br>Sweet glean, that dreads nor iron hand of pow'r,</br>Nor gripe of wealth, that would that right devour:</br>Bless'd husbandman, thy hope, thy legal spoil,</br>The heav'nly product of thy sultry toil;</br>That heaps with store th' unenviable board,</br>That smiles obedience to the rustic lord;</br>The blazing hearth, the fam'd historick tale,</br>Warms the brisk tankard of the home-brew'd ale.</br>Prattling between these intervals of bliss,</br>The playful Infant courts the Father's kiss:</br>Climbs o'er his knee, and gently strokes his cheek,</br>Feign would say something could it only speak.</br>Learn hence, ye proud, that happiness can dwell</br>Supreme, beyond the pow'r of words to tell;</br>Where the brown loaf more solid gladness gives,</br>Than Greatness, thou, thy luxury receives.</br>But ah!  what means yon doleful sound of woe?</br>Procession moving, melancholy slow.</br>The Vicar leads the solemn dirge to join,</br>The Village pair'd unite in song divine;</br>Chaunting the hundredth psalm &mdash; The fun'ral knell,</br>Foretold th' old Soldier, old Acasto fell.</br>Alas!  alas!  the neighbours far and near,</br>Hasten to deck the good Acasto's bier:</br>The pall was borne by Shepherds &mdash; six were told,</br>That grac'd this ancient Father of the Fold.</br>The belt that girt his body to the war,</br>The huge broad sword, that gave the deadly scar:</br>Like trophies led to where his Fathers slept,</br>The 'Squire was there, and all the Village wept.</br>The Vicar's text, from that he never swerv'd,</br>Which gave him all the merit he deserv'd:</br>Excess, nor Winter's blast destroy'd his life,</br>Like Autumn fruit he fell when over ripe.</br>Conscious no force, nor flight itself could save,</br>Where cowards mingle with the fallen brave:</br>Life though he valu'd, not afraid to die,</br>Resign'd its comforts, nor yet heav'd a sigh.</br>Dying bequeath'd, though not on marble stone,</br>An epitaph, that might have graced one:</br>This to the Village left, 'twas all he had,</br>To cheer the good, to reconcile the bad.</br>While living, gave, whate'er he had to give,</br>As such, alas!  'twas all he had to leave.", "EPITAPH.</br>In this bless'd vale Acasto drew his breath!</br>Here too undaunted, dauntless smil'd at death:</br>Prudence, directress of his little store,</br>Oft' left a little for the needy poor:</br>Temp'rance to man best gift he early sought,</br>Follow'd the path which Wisdom soundly taught.</br>This length of days to old Acasto gave,</br>This spar'd so long his body from the grave:</br>Spar'd him perhaps t' adorn some future page,</br>When record tells, one hundred years of age.</br>With manly fortitude, with decent strife,</br>He war'd against the varied ills of life,</br>Then Soldier-like each earthly dart defy'd,</br>Thought he'd liv'd long enough, and nobly died.</br>Shepherds attend!  like him at close of night,</br>When ev'ning blushes with departed light;</br>When the rose brightens as the sun grows low,</br>And Death with gentle hand inflicts the blow;</br>When the lone sheep retires beneath the shade,</br>From storms recluse for contemplation made,</br>Think on Acasto, stay the passing tear,</br>Nor dread the thought of dissolution near.</br>Tho' frail existence with unwearied pace,</br>Points to eternity's unbounded space,</br>Still life's last slumbers garland crown'd shall wait,</br>To glad thy passage to a future state.</br>The soul reviving shall each glory meet,</br>And feel its own, its own inspired sweet.</br>Cold though the breeze, the bark with sail unfurl'd,</br>Shall waft Thee soaring to th' immortal world.</br>While here with comfort unperceiv'd decay,</br>Life, sweetly slumb'ring, softly steals away.&mdash;</br>"]
