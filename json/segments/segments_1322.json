["Faint gleams the evening radiance thro' the sky,</br>The sober twilight dimly darkens round;</br>In short quick circles the shrill bat flits by,</br>And the slow vapour curls along the ground.", "Now the pleas'd eye from yon lone cottage sees</br>On the green mead the smoke long-shadowing play;</br>The Red-breast on the blossom'd spray</br>Warbles wild her latest lay;</br>And sleeps along the dale the silent breeze.</br>Calm CONTEMPLATION, 'tis thy favourite hour!</br>Come fill my bosom, tranquillizing Power.", "Meek Power!  I view thee on the calmy shore</br>When Ocean stills his waves to rest;</br>Or when slow-moving on the surges hoar</br>Meet with deep hollow roar</br>And whiten o'er his breast;</br>For lo!  the Moon with softer radiance gleams,</br>And lovelier heave the billows in her beams.", "When the low gales of evening moan along,</br>I love with thee to feel the calm cool breeze,</br>And roam the pathless forest wilds among,</br>Listening the mellow murmur of the trees</br>Full-foliaged, as they wave their heads on high,</br>And wave their shadowy heads in wildest melody.", "Or lead me where amid the tranquil vale</br>The broken streamlet flows in silver light;</br>And I will linger where the gale</br>O'er the bank of violets sighs,</br>Listening to hear its soften'd sounds arise,</br>And hearken the dull beetle's drowsy flight,</br>And watch the horn-eyed snail</br>Creep o'er his long moon-glittering trail,</br>And mark where radiant thro' the night</br>Moves in the grass-green hedge the glow-worms living light.", "Thee, meekest Power!  I love to meet,</br>As oft with solitary pace</br>The scatter'd Abbeys hallowed rounds I trace,</br>And listen to the echoings of my feet.</br>Or on the half demolish'd tomb,</br>Whose warning texts anticipate my doom:</br>Mark the clear orb of night</br>Cast thro' the storying arch a faintly-varied light.", "Nor will I not in some more gloomy hour</br>Invoke with fearless awe thine holier power,</br>Wandering beneath the sainted pile</br>When the blast moans along the darksome aisle,</br>And clattering patters all around</br>The midnight shower with dreary sound.", "But sweeter 'tis to wander wild</br>By melancholy dreams beguil'd,</br>While the summer moon's pale ray</br>Faintly guides me on my way</br>To some lone romantic glen</br>Far from all the haunts of men;</br>Where no noise of uproar rude</br>Breaks the calm of solitude;</br>But soothing Silence sleeps in all,</br>Save the neighbouring waterfall,</br>Whose hoarse waters falling near</br>Load with hollow sounds the ear,</br>And with down-dasht torrent white</br>Gleam hoary through the shades of night", "Thus wandering silent on and slow,</br>I'll nurse Reflection's sacred woe,</br>And muse upon the perish'd day</br>When Hope would weave her visions gay,</br>Ere FANCY, chill'd by adverse fate,</br>Left sad REALITY my mate.", "O CONTEMPLATION!  when to Memory's eyes</br>The visions of the long-past days arise,</br>Thy holy power imparts the best relief,</br>And the calm'd Spirit loves the joy of grief.</br>"]
