["I.</br>'Twas at his House, in old Gabaa built,</br>Sad Saul lay conscious of his Guilt,</br>With Grace no longer bless'd,</br>Distracted, griev'd, oppress'd,</br>His Brain disorder'd, and his Soul possess'd.</br>See!  See!  He cries,</br>See the Fiends where they rise!</br>Oh!  Help, they o'erpow'r me!</br>They snatch, they devour me!</br>Then wild from his Couch all trembling he bounded,</br>In Terror, in Rage, and with Phantoms confounded.</br>His Friends around in Anguish wait,</br>They weep, they wail, they mourn his Fate;</br>In vain they mourn, they strive in vain</br>To calm his Soul, and sooth his Pain.</br>They heard of David's tuneful Fame,</br>For him they sent, and David came.</br>He cou'd to Wonder touch the Lyre,</br>Or gay or serious Thoughts inspire;</br>Cou'd soften Pain, and Grief asswage,</br>Now lull the Soul to soft Desire,</br>Now rouze it into Rage.", "II.</br>The Psalmist plac'd before the King,</br>Examin'd whence the Madness came:</br>He soon betray'd the hateful Spring,</br>And sought a proper Theme.</br>Upon the Harp his Head reclin'd,</br>To that his Ear intent was giv'n,</br>Coelestial Thoughts inflame his Mind,</br>And now and then he stole an Eye to Heav'n.</br>First in gentle Strains surprising,</br>Softly, sadly, sweetly rising,</br>Man, oh Man!  Why still pursuing,</br>Still, he sung, thy own Undoing!</br>Always Falling, then Repenting,</br>Wav'ring still, and still Resolving,</br>Now Rejoycing, then Relenting,</br>Now in Joys forbid Dissolving.</br>Cans't thou find, Oh!  find no Measure,</br>Know no Mean of Pain, of Pleasure!</br>The Notes prevail, kind soften'd Thoughts impart,</br>Steal on the Ear and sink into the Heart.", "III.</br>Now David sings in Numbers loud,</br>How Heav'n confounds th' Unjust and Proud,</br>Chastises those who doubt his Sway,</br>And those who don't, and Disobey.</br>He then began the Fate of those,</br>Who in the Desart against Moses rose.</br>Behold while they their Censers light,</br>And Incense burn in his Despight,</br>Corah, their Chiefs, their Goods and Temples round,</br>At once down swallow'd in the gaping Ground!</br>From Heav'n then pour'd a Tempest of Fire,</br>And in the Flame the Vulgar expire.</br>The King with Terror hears,</br>Reflects, reviews his Life;</br>He Trembles, Weeps, appears</br>All over Thought and Grief.", "IV.</br>The Prophet soon perceiv'd the Prince</br>Too sadly touch'd for his Offence;</br>His sorrowing Soul, o'ercome with Fear,</br>And Grief, declining to Despair.</br>Then sung in sprightly Lays,</br>His sinking Heart to raise:</br>Man is the Darling of the Sky,</br>God views us with a Parent's Eye;</br>For Heav'n he designs us,</br>From Error reclines us;</br>And while his Commands we obey,</br>We gain ourselves Treasures</br>Of Joys and of Pleasures,</br>Of Pleasures that never decay.</br>And tho' greatly and often we stray,</br>If Pardon repentant we pray,</br>With Joy he gives Ear,</br>With Grace crowns our Pray'r,</br>Why shou'd, why shou'd we, why shou'd we,</br>Why shou'd we then ever despair?</br>All over the Skies</br>Hosannas arise,</br>And Heav'n is declar'd forgiving and wise.</br>Reviv'd at the Sound,</br>The Prince star'd around,</br>He breath'd, and he hop'd, and Comfort he found.", "V.</br>But, lo!  the wicked Fiend within</br>Would fain pervert his Hope to Sin,</br>And to Presumption swell his Soul again.</br>Who'd lead a painful Life,</br>When Sighs, a Moment's Grief,</br>Regain departed Grace,</br>And blackest Crimes efface?</br>This the divine Exorcist hears,</br>The pleasing Med'cine soon prepares;</br>Kindly checks in feeling Measures,</br>All his Love, his Bent to Pleasures.</br>O Gideon!  Gideon!  once so great,</br>So dreadful in the listed Plain,</br>Now where is all the regal State,</br>How short-liv'd all thy pompous Reign!</br>The Great, the Just, the Glorious, Grave,</br>Like Madian fills the silent Grave:</br>Thousands no more confess his Sway,</br>In Dust he lies, a Reptile's Prey.</br>A doleful Murmur fills the vaulted Room,</br>While, each reflecting on his future Doom,</br>Saul checks his Pride, and ceases to presume.</br>Prostrate he falls, reveres the Skies,</br>With Pray'r propitiates Heav'n,</br>With lifted Hands, and flowing Eyes,</br>Implores to be forgiv'n.", "VI.</br>But hark!  how nobler Strains surprise!</br>Spreading and loud the solemn Notes arise,</br>And in exalted Sounds slow, length'ning, mount the Skies.</br>Oh!  Lord of Hosts!  how bless'd are they</br>Who act obsequious to thy Sway!</br>Thy Arm the Wicked lays in Dust,</br>Thy Arm exalts and shields the Just:</br>Thy Nod can shake the mighty Ball;</br>Before thy Thunder Armies fall;</br>From Thee all Good, all Life descend,</br>And thou art All in All,</br>Sole Lord of Heav'n, and Earth and Hell,</br>Unfelt, Unheard, Invisible;</br>Too vast for mortal Tongue to tell,</br>Or Thought to comprehend.</br>With Love and Fear of Heav'n inspir'd,</br>Saul stood in Raptures, and admir'd</br>The Psalmist's bless'd harmonious Art,</br>No more to Rage or Grief inclin'd,</br>Prospects divine engage his Mind,</br>And Gladness fills his Heart.", "VII.</br>Thus David's Harp cou'd mend the Soul,</br>The black Attempts of Hell controul;</br>And Musick thus, in former Days,</br>Resounded sweet Almighty's Praise,</br>Cou'd calm the Mind to Peace, and Heav'nly Raptures raise.</br>In After-Times its Force decays,</br>To soften'd Sounds confin'd,</br>Poorly content the Ear to please,</br>But not exalt the Mind.</br>Divine Cecilia came at length,</br>Improv'd its Sweetness, and reviv'd its Strength,</br>Her Author's Praise harmoniously renew'd,</br>And David's bold coelestial Strains pursu'd.</br>When the loud nervous Organ sounds,</br>We hear, we hear we know not what,</br>Something solemn, something great,</br>Wrapt in the Skies, ourselves no more,</br>Scorn earthly Things we sought before,</br>And fir'd with more than mortal Heat,</br>Contemn all narrow Bounds.</br>Swell all ye Organs!  inspire ev'ry Flute!</br>Leave, Heav'nly Minstrels!  no Instrument mute!</br>Revive ev'ry Lyre, awake ev'ry String,</br>And loudly resound the Virgin and King!</br>He cou'd a Prince's Rage appease,</br>A wicked Fiend disarm;</br>She cou'd to Heav'n an Atheist raise,</br>And did an Angel charm.</br>"]
