["And this was Scotland's noblest son of song!</br>How calm his mien &mdash; how still his look!</br>Where be the flashes, bright and brief, yet strong,</br>Of mirth that revels, though the wise rebuke?</br>Tell me, thou limner, in what secret nook</br>Of this expanse of chasten'd countenance,</br>There lurk'd the gibe and jest which often shook</br>The stolid crowd &mdash; in wit's omnipotence?</br>Why live not these in this? &mdash; and where their recompense?", "Lurks the rich treasure in that placid gaze&mdash;</br>In the deep meaning of these full-orb'd eyes&mdash;</br>In the veil'd lustre which, as through a haze</br>Of mellowing beauty, meekly lifts the guise</br>Of mere humanity, and shows what lies</br>In the far chambers of the soul still kept?</br>It does! &mdash; it does! &mdash; and, O!  more dear I prize</br>The soft, yet manly sadness that hath crept</br>O'er this, than would I all the heights by art o'erleapt.", "Look!  what a brow soars o'er these arched spells,</br>That fix my gaze, they look so sad on me!</br>See!  where hid meaning into language swells</br>Upon those lips, that seem as tremblingly</br>To heave, as leaves upon a wind-woo'd tree!</br>Yet prophet power hath touch'd them with its fire;</br>With burning balm love dew'd them thrillingly!</br>Have they not blazed, like lightning on a pyre,</br>As from them flash'd the words that speak a patriot's ire?", "O!  it is deeply true &mdash; no transient glance</br>Can tell the meaning of the poet's look;</br>For who shall say, who on one mood may chance</br>To wondering gaze, that he hath not mistook</br>The hue the moment's inspiration took,</br>For the deep shadows that from others hide</br>The broken hopes, the soul's self-urg'd rebuke,</br>Which in his breast for ever might abide,</br>Converting into gall, dear Burns!  thy heart's warm tide!</br>"]
