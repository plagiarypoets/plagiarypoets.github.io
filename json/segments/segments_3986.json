["Though I am wedded to far other lore,</br>And far severer, than the muse requires:</br>Friend! &mdash; I rejoice in Feeling's every pore,</br>At the pure fame of thy devout desires.</br>Some Bards have kindled their too brilliant fires,</br>At the gross altar, and unhallowed hearth;</br>Thou hast been joined to more exalted choirs,</br>And, uninspired to sing our second birth,</br>Hath poured the ointment of thy praise upon the joys of earth.</br>"]
