["I.</br>The Sun now posted to his watry Bed,</br>The Evening was with gloomy Clouds o'erspread,</br>When from a solitary Grove I home retir'd,</br>But found my self (alas) not now inspir'd</br>With any Genius for Poetry,</br>Such as on nice Occasions us'd to be;</br>But ominous Melancholy prest</br>My Spirits, and with strange infection fill'd my Breast:</br>The Faculties and Orders of my Soul,</br>Thoughts sad as Death did now controul.</br>I hastned to repose, but could not rest.</br>'Till with long watching tir'd, a troubled Slumber eas'd</br>My wearied Sense, or rather fatall Numbness seiz'd</br>My vital Parts all o'er, whilst to my Eye,</br>In visionary Scenes, was shewn this Prodigy.", "II.</br>A Royal Banquet in a spacious Place</br>Hung round with Arras, figuring the Race</br>Of Gods, of Heroes, and of Kings;</br>And wond'rous Stories of most wond'rous things</br>Methought I saw prepar'd; at which in State</br>The gracious Gloriana sate:</br>Around her all the Nobles of the Land,</br>Those that bore Office and Command,</br>Place, or Dependence from the Crown;</br>With others also that had none,</br>In order were; grave Heads that Mitres wore,</br>Grandees that held white Rods, Judges in Robes with Fur;</br>And round the Hall on large Degrees rais'd high</br>Another august Company,</br>The great Supporters of the Diadem,</br>And of the Nation's Glory and Esteem,</br>The English Commons sate</br>Like the Disposers of resolving Fate;</br>Who from the prying Croud did Rev'rence draw,</br>By Looks, with Signs of Knowledge grac'd, and legislative Awe.</br>Next these were mixt a Number more</br>Promiscuously that Office bore,</br>And each in's happy Station did reveal</br>The secret Joy his Heart did feel,</br>Down from the Pages that attend, up to the potent Seal,</br>A grand Affair there was to do,</br>Form'd to promote the national Interest,</br>As well as make the City blest;</br>And in a Charter newly wrote, presented to her View.</br>And here, methought, the Praetor of the Town,</br>With all his Brethren, Traders of Renown,</br>Wrapt up in Fur, with each a Chain embellishing his Gown,</br>Made the demure Petition on their Knees,</br>And never seem'd so well at Ease;</br>All with a Look sincere, in humble View,</br>Tho' perhaps perfect at the Heart but few;</br>(What cannot Citizens for Profit do?)</br>Whilst to their fam'd Recorder, grave and wise,</br>Th' attentive Sovereign, with a Smile,</br>Short Answer made, but in so kind a Style,</br>That now they thought their Feast well given;</br>Praising their Royal Saint,</br>In Expectation of her Grant,</br>Beyond the brightest Cherubin in Heaven.</br>And nothing now was heard and seen</br>But joyful Hums, and Grins, and Looks, half comick, half serene,</br>All closing with, Oh, happy we and long, long live the Queen.", "III.</br>But whilst this general Joy</br>In every Face appear'd,</br>All blest with Gloriana's gracious Eye;</br>Who pleas'd with what she saw and heard,</br>With Freedom gave her Satisfaction vent,</br>And full of easy Goodness shew'd her Liking and Content.</br>From the swol'n Bosom of a gloomy Cloud</br>A thunder Clap was heard so loud,</br>With such a frightful Sound</br>As when the mighty Saviour dy'd,</br>The sacred Temple did divide;</br>And divine Vengeance rent the trembling Ground.</br>Amazing Horror straight surpriz'd each Face,</br>Nor now could that Majestick Grace</br>That late in Gloriana shone, appear,</br>For even she grew chang'd with Fear:</br>Her chearful Face, with deadly Pale o'er-cast,</br>Lookt like a fragrant Flower struck with a withering Blast.</br>Then straight, methought, the Roof was seen to cleave,</br>Rafters torn out, the tott'ring Building leave,</br>Whilst Eastward from the Sky</br>A Radiant Form descending charm'd each Eye.</br>With Glories of immense Divinity:</br>Four Cherubs that on th' Angel came to wait,</br>Whose Looks a Pow'r display'd superior to Fate,</br>Went up where England's Guardian Regent sate;</br>Her seiz'd, then with their precious Load withdrew,</br>And thro' the wide expanding Air to their third Heaven flew;</br>Whilst Uriel, for now might each one see,</br>By his bright glittering Form, and lucid Front, 'twas he,</br>One of the glorious Seven that always stand</br>In sight of God's high Throne, on his right Hand,</br>And to the lower World first bears his dread Command:</br>With sacred Voice thus spoke, whilst every Stander by</br>On the blest Orator fixt a heedful Eye,</br>All charm'd with the Embassador, and thirsting all to hear his Embassy.", "IV.</br>Not yet, oh sinful People, are your Crimes</br>Blotted from the Eternal's Memory;</br>The Faults of past and present Times,</br>In the Omnipotent's All-seeing Eye,</br>Bear yet too fresh and deep a Dye</br>To let his Justice grant ye true Felicity:</br>Instead of that your vile Offences are</br>Writ in so large a Roll, he do's prepare</br>Severest Vengeance, greater still, and more</br>Then e'er yet scourg'd your stubborn Land, or Egypt heretofore.</br>The Plague of Frogs, of Locusts, and of Lice,</br>Or chrystal Currents turn'd to Blood;</br>When all the fetter'd Fish in vain devis'd</br>With finny Wings to 'scape the gory Mud,</br>Equals not half the Curse, not half the Punishment.</br>Your Queen, your earthly Goddess here below,</br>To whose excelling Virtue you your Blessings owe,</br>Whose Smiles, like the bright Ruler of the Day,</br>Made all things flourish, all things gay:</br>Your Gloriana, whom you so adore,</br>Ah!  wretched beyond Thought, shall bless your Eyes no more.</br>Thus has the angry Maker doom'd, and his Decree</br>Is thus pronounc'd by me,</br>The dear lov'd Genius of your Land shall die,</br>And pass thro' Nature to Eternity;</br>From mortal Cares immortal Blessings prove,</br>And leave a fading Glory here for lasting Joys above.</br>This spoke, the glittering Angel disappear'd,</br>And now, methought was heard</br>A confus'd horrid Noise</br>Of Shrieks, and Groans, and Cries,</br>The glorious Scene too chang'd, and in its stead</br>Infernal Night her blackest Fogs had spread</br>Over the baleful Place, dark as the Regions of the Dead.", "V.</br>'Till by some Flashes of aetherial Fire,</br>And fatal Fulgor, glimmering Light was lent;</br>Which shew'd a Cavern where the Fates retire,</br>And where in dreadful Shades their horrid Hours are spent.</br>Around the Place where ugly Shapes of Death,</br>Bare Skelitons, and all the Floor beneath</br>With Heaps of Skulls and Bones were scatter'd o'er,</br>Of Men that had been Mighty heretofore,</br>Mingled with Scrolls of human Names spotted and stain'd with Gore,</br>Brought thither by a grizly Train,</br>Which for that Work the Sisters entertain</br>DISEASES call'd, a foul mishapen Crew,</br>That thousands daily to Destruction drew.</br>And first, with numerous Scrolls, came FEVER, wither'd, lean,</br>His Heart and Intrails scorcht within</br>With unseen Fire, that long had flaming been;</br>Next him remorseless PLAGUE his Charge he sign'd;</br>Swol'n DROPSY then with slow CONSUMPTION join'd,</br>Their deadly Labels brought, more loiter'd too behind,</br>Down from the lowly Country Girl up to the Sovereign Queen.</br>But amongst all that on this Office came,</br>Death's Friends and Agents, Gouty, Blind, and Lame,</br>Methought I saw one bring a Scroll</br>That with new Terror fill'd my Soul;</br>A Scroll where in large Characters was Gloriana's Name.</br>Trembling at this I found, as near I prest,</br>His Title wrote in Blood upon his Breast,</br>Dead-doing APPOPLEX, whom when pleas'd Clotho saw,</br>She straight a slender Twine was seen to draw;</br>Which envious Lachesis soon on the Distaff put,</br>And Atropos, as soon prepar'd, with bloody Shears to cut.</br>Then each with dismal yelling Voice,</br>And hellish Grin, seem'd to rejoice</br>To know the World should lose such an inestimable Prize.", "VI.</br>'Twas here the Vision left my fetter'd Sense,</br>Here Fears anew 'gan to commence,</br>And Grief straight follow'd close; for scarce my Eyes</br>Had made their Opticks free from Sleep's Surprize,</br>But to my Ears the Horror enter'd in</br>Of dreadful News, the Sickness of the QUEEN.</br>Too true 'twas found, for now each Hour accurst</br>Flew with more fatal Tidings than the first;</br>From bad to worse, 'till the third dismal Day</br>We heard the Life of our Britannia lay,</br>The Prize of Death, just languishing away;</br>That darling Life, more precious than the Store</br>Of India's Jems, or universal Ore.</br>Oh Heaven!  maugre all our Tears,</br>Our fervent Wishes, and our Prayers;</br>The Skill which all the skilful Sons of Art</br>With nicest Judgment could impart,</br>One suddain curst Disease had Power</br>In a few Moments to devour,</br>And by Commission from eternal Will</br>Mock the Divine's, and the Physician's Skill.</br>Thus when Omnipotence do's Blessings give</br>He thus asserts his high Prerogative,</br>When serv'd bestows the Gifts we all partake,</br>And when his Grace we lose he calls 'em back;</br>Wisely demonstrating superior Right,</br>The Creature's Merit, the Creator's Might.</br>But now, oh Muse!  how can thy Influence</br>So far inspire my Sense?</br>How shall my ill-performing Pen and Hand</br>Describe the gushing Sorrows of the Land,</br>Shew the attending Mourners that stood by;</br>Who each with frighted Look and flowing Eye,</br>Made the vast Deluge swell so universally,</br>That all around Grief so immense appears</br>As if the World, a modern Way, were to be drown'd in Tears?</br>Our hapless Land a Woe particular,</br>Beyond the rest of Nations did prefer;</br>And whilst new Seas of Brine surround our chalky Shore</br>Albion was ne'er so true an Isle before.", "VII.</br>Oh, Albion, in thy Loss more curst by far</br>Than in all Ruins of thy Civil War:</br>Thy florent Soil's a barren Desert now,</br>Sad as thy Natives Weeds, and clouded as each Brow.</br>Bend thy aspiring Head, for Ashes crown</br>Thy haughty Front, and for past Crimes atone;</br>That like offending Nineveh of old,</br>Dire Desolation by this Blow foretold,</br>May by the humble Sackcloth be delay'd,</br>And Heaven's consuming Vengeance by Repentance stay'd.</br>And now my drooping Muse again is at a stand,</br>My Pen shakes in my trembling Hand</br>At my bold daring thus my Thoughts to raise,</br>On Gloriana's Theme or Praise:</br>Virtue that scarce has equall'd been, or will in future Days.</br>That Royal Virgin that so long maintain'd</br>The English Cross, and with such Judgment reign'd,</br>That forty Years the Joys and Toils of glorious Empire knew,</br>Ne'er such Applause or Adoration drew</br>As matchless Gloriana in her few:</br>That happy Princess govern'd when</br>Obedience was a Gift in Men;</br>When mild Allegiance bow'd to sovereign Awe,</br>And Duty was contiguous with Law.</br>But Gloriana fated to put on</br>The weighty Trouble of a Crown,</br>In a hot Ferment found the State,</br>Perplext with factious Jarring and Debate.</br>Yet still encourag'd by coelestial Aid,</br>The Royal Shepherdess divinely sway'd;</br>Held out her Crook, and the rude Herd obey'd.</br>And as the famous Thracian Poet once</br>Drew to his Lyre Birds, Beasts, and Trees and Stone,</br>So th' savage Inmates by mild Arts the mind;</br>Some curs'd the Cause, but not the Conduct blam'd,</br>Her Foes her charming Grace so much had won,</br>The worst but faintly envy'd her the Throne.", "VIII.</br>So Esther, who her Nation's Rights restor'd,</br>For Piety and Wisdom was ador'd;</br>And so will Gloriana's Name eterniz'd be</br>Thro' future Years to all Posterity;</br>The last of Female Sovereigns, and the best.</br>But ah!  the Saint is gone &mdash; and Miracles are ceas'd,</br>And well might she the Name of Saint deserve,</br>Who the Almighty did so truly serve:</br>Her regular Devotion every Day</br>Might even teach Piety it self to pray;</br>None could be wicked in her Service blest,</br>Her holy Flame divinely warm'd the Breast,</br>Example first the Good began, and Shame perform'd the rest.</br>Nor was her Wife-like Virtue less admir'd,</br>But every Breast where Honour was inspir'd,</br>So much, that even our sensual Nation</br>Began their brutal Crimes to see,</br>And honest Wedlock, Amity,</br>Began again to be in Fashion,</br>Thus all her Hours did strict Goodness sway,</br>Angelically thus she spent each Day;</br>Thoughtless of Ill, unless 'twere to prevent;</br>Her mirthful Minutes too so innocent,</br>As if a Life Divine she meant to try</br>Before she came to die,</br>And th' great Disposer of her Soul was always standing by.", "IX.</br>For Pity too, for heavenly Clemency,</br>None ever more renown'd than she;</br>Who Justice Scales so mildly did command,</br>And held the Sword in such guiltless Hand,</br>That even the Malefactors in the Land</br>In Murders train'd, and Traitors made for hire;</br>Nay tho' thy durst against her precious Life conspire,</br>And thereby Punishment more justly drew</br>Than th' rest of the incorrigible Crew;</br>Yet was she never found the more severe,</br>Nor even Death's black Warrant sign'd but wet it with a Tear.</br>Oh!  were that great Apostle here to see,</br>That preach'd Salvation gain'd by Works of Charity,</br>Her wond'rous Mercies in that kind,</br>And the unwearied Bounties of her Mind</br>Far above all the rest,</br>He'd still pronounce her blest;</br>And fix for her a heavenly Seat next the most high Degree.</br>She needed but a small Translation there,</br>Half of Perfection had the Angel here.</br>Poor Protestants, by foreign Vileness, driven</br>From their Abodes, for the dear sake of Heaven;</br>Forlorn and starving in the Fields,</br>Her Pitying Bosom sacred Manna yields,</br>Thus Numbers from the giving Saint receiv'd;</br>Thus Numbers daily her blest Hand reliev'd.</br>Oh!  sacred Virtue there is still in thee</br>So sweet a Charm, such true Divinity,</br>That when thou wilt unfold thy beauteous Face,</br>And with thy Beams fair human Nature grace,</br>How pall'd to thee the World's vain Pleasures are,</br>How sickly do they waste, how wretched they appear?</br>Thou, divine Essence, always did inspire</br>Blest Gloriana with thy hallow'd Fire,</br>The Royal Saint was full a Type of thee,</br>As thou art of angelick Piety.", "X.</br>Mighty in Power, yet mild still as a Dove,</br>A Temper form'd of Piety and Love;</br>Devout as Deborah at a Sacrifice;</br>Chaste like Susanna, and like Sheba Wise;</br>Like Michal, kind and dutious to her Lord,</br>And like a Saviour lost, lamented and ador'd.", "More Attributes, much more might be exprest,</br>But Sorrow stops my Pen, and hinders all the rest;</br>My Muse grows weary with this glut of Woe,</br>And now no more can do.</br>Onely methinks I see from high</br>A radiant Cherub, soaring thro' the Sky,</br>Saying, Let Women be no more defam'd,</br>Nor ever henceforth for past Frailty blam'd,</br>Th' unbounded Virtues of this One</br>Do amply for their Faults atone,</br>With the eternal Compensation make,</br>And all the rest of Female Kind are pardon'd for her sake.</br>"]
