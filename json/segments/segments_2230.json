["On this my pensive pillow, gentle Sleep!</br>Descend, in all thy downy plumage drest:</br>Wipe with thy wing these eyes that wake to weep,</br>And place thy crown of poppies on my breast.", "O steep my senses in oblivion's balm,</br>And sooth my throbbing pulse with lenient hand;</br>This tempest of my boiling blood becalm!&mdash;</br>Despair grows mild at thy supreme command.", "Yet ah!  in vain, familiar with the gloom,</br>And sadly toiling through the tedious night,</br>I seek sweet slumber, while that virgin bloom,</br>For ever hovering, haunts my wretched sight.", "Nor would the dawning day my sorrows charm:</br>Black midnight, and the radiant noon, alike</br>To me appear, while with uplifted arm</br>Death stands prepar'd, but still delays, to strike.</br>"]
