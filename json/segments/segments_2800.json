["O worthiest of esteem and love,</br>Of all the immortal powers above,</br>Hygeia, sweetest nymph!  with thee</br>May all my future days be free!</br>Nor thou with me refuse to dwell,</br>A willing inmate of my cell!", "For every joy which wealth bestows,</br>Which from the love of offspring flows,</br>Which towering empire gives, the height</br>Of human bliss, man's chief delight;</br>Whate'er from Beauty's magic fire,</br>Those darling objects of desire,</br>Whom, plac'd before our ravish'd view</br>We with impetuous speed pursue</br>Toward the snares, and hidden nets,</br>Which laughter-loving Venus sets;</br>If any other bliss from heaven</br>To soothe the soul of man is given,</br>Any sweet recompense is given,</br>With thee, and cherish'd by thy smile,</br>(Best of the immortal powers above!)</br>They flourish all; before thee rove</br>Each Grace, each Virtue, while the ray</br>Of pure content beams cheerful day.", "But from thy presence doom'd to part,</br>No transport strikes man's anxious heart;</br>Thick clouds of woe o'erspread his eye,</br>The Loves, and winged Pleasures fly.</br>"]
