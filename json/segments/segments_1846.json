["In Fancy-Land there is a burst of wo,</br>The spirit's tribute to the fallen; see</br>On each scarr'd front the cloud of sorrow grow,</br>Bloating its sprightly shine.  But what is he</br>For whom grief's mighty butt is broach'd so free?</br>Were his brows shadow'd by the awful crown,</br>The Bishop's mitre, or high plumery</br>Of the mail'd warrior?  Won he his renown</br>On pulpit, throne, or filed, whom death hath now struck down?", "He won it in the field where arms are none,</br>Save those the mother gives to us.  He was</br>A climbing star which had not fully shone,</br>Yet promised in his glory to surpass</br>Our champion star ascendant; but alas!</br>The sceptred shade that values earthly might,</br>And pow'r, and pith, and bottom, as the grass,</br>Gave with his fleshless fist a buffet slight;&mdash;</br>Say, bottle-holding Leech, why ends so soon the fight?", "What boots it t' inquire? &mdash; 'Tis done.  Green mantled Erin</br>May weep here hopes of milling sway past by,</br>And Crib, sublime, no lowlier rival fearing,</br>Repose, sole Ammon of the fistic sky,</br>Conceited, quaffing his blue ruin high,</br>Till comes the Swell, that come to all men must,</br>By whose foul blows Sir Daniel low doth lie,</br>Summons the Champion to resign his trust,</br>And mingles with Kings, Slaves, Chieftains, Beggars' dust!</br>"]
