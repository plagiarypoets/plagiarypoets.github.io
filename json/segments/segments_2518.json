["The bell of Arragon, they say,</br>Spontaneous speaks the fatal day</br>When, as its tones peal wild and high,</br>Iberia's kings are doom'd to die.", "Whatever dark aerial power</br>Commissioned, haunts the gloomy tower,</br>So deep the spell, each starts with fear</br>That strange unearthly sound to hear.", "O'er me, when death his arm hath flung,</br>May no such awful knell be rung;</br>But, breathing mild a last farewell,</br>Toll sad, yet sweet, some simpler bell!</br>"]
