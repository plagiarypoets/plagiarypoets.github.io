Death,</br>With vig'rous Wings, he rises from beneath:</br>With wond'rous Swiftness cuts his aeiry Way,</br>And soon in Distance lost, pursues his tim'rous Prey.</br>So strong, so swift, so in a Line upright,</br>The Fury mounted to the Coasts of Light:</br>Then to Iberia's Realm she wing'd her Way,</br>And at the Court arriv'd at Dawn of Day:</br>When Light and Shade contend with doubtful War,</br>Which shall possess the Empire of the Air:</br>When like Success, and equal Forces lay</br>In even Scales, the Fortune of the Day.</br>Now Trav'llers from their Eyes soft Slumber shake,</br>And for new Labour, Swains their Beds forsake.</br>The roaming Lion, surfeited with Spoil,</br>Comes to his Den fatigu'd with bloody Toil.</br>Now wand'ring Ghosts and Spectres leaves the Air,</br>And to their low, unlightsome Seats repair.</br>Of thickest Shades, that bounding Beams repel</br>And pitchy Smoke, cast from the Mouth of Hell,</br>A long black Robe the Fury did prepare,</br>Such as th' Ignatian, cruel Order wear.</br>She then the ambient Air with Art compress'd,</br>And in a Moment Human Members dress'd:</br>She did the Figure, Face, and Mien assume,</br>Of Loyola, the Prop and Pride of Rome.", "All Night th' Iberian Monarch wakeful lay,</br>Meeting with eager Eyes, returning Day:</br>To sooth reluctant Cares, and ease his Pain,</br>He turn'd from Side to Side, but turn'd in vain.</br>A thousand Terrors interrupt his Rest,</br>A thousand Troubles vex his anxious Breast:</br>The Thoughts of Belgia's long protracted War,</br>Corrode his Bosom, and his Heart-strings tear;</br>Whence daily Courriers bring him fresh Alarms</br>Or from Batavian or Britannick Arms.</br>Now to his Thoughts Eliza does appear,</br>Mauritius now, and now, the mighty Vere,</br>Who much provok'd his Hate, but more his Fear:</br>He thinks what wealthy Provinces were gone,</br>And what fair Towns were from his Empire won:</br>How white with Spanish Bones the Mountains grow,</br>Red with their Blood, how Belgick Rivers flow.</br>He hears their Shrieks, and lamentable Cry,</br>Who by his Order, did in Torment lye;</br>Or over whom accurss'd Assassins stood,</br>With Sword in Hand, prepar'd to shed their Blood:</br>The Ghosts of murder'd Men past by his Bed,</br>They show'd their Ghastly Wounds, and shook their Head.</br>Here Noble Horno's Form did threatning stand,</br>And there brave Egmont becken'd with his Hand:</br>Here Bergen groan'd, and there Don Carlos stood,</br>Shedding from every Vein Imperial Blood.</br>These were the Objects that enrag'd his Breast;</br>These Perturbations chas'd away his Rest:</br>If he compos'd himself with Hopes to find</br>Sleep to his Eyes, and Quiet to his Mind;</br>If Slumber softly crept, that by Surprize,</br>It might the Passes take, and shut his Eyes,</br>To calm his Thoughts, and lull his lab'ring Brain,</br>Some frightful Vision broke the downy Chain:</br>As when a Storm of Wind the Ocean moves,</br>And rolling Billows, this and that way shoves;</br>Uproar and Strife embroil the restless Deep,</br>Nor will the swelling Waves lye down to Sleep:</br>So on the King tempestuous Passions prest,</br>Tumultuous Thoughts did so distract his Breast,</br>So agitate his Soul, so drive away his Rest.", "In these Inquietudes the Mornarch lay,</br>And with impatient Eyes demanded Day:</br>When the fierce Fiend did with a reverend Grace</br>Enter the Room, and halted in her Pace;</br>Then low she bow'd, and thus the King addrest;</br>Hail Phillip, mighty Monarch of the West;</br>The Realms of unmollested Peace and Joy,</br>Where pure Delights do never fade or cloy:</br>Where the bless'd Saints in fresh Coelestial Bow'rs,</br>And endless Pleasures, pass their happy Hours:</br>I leave those anxious Cares to dispossess,</br>Which with their Weight your gen'rous Soul oppress;</br>To tell the Means, how Belgia to regain,</br>Extend your Pow'r by Land, and o'er the Main,</br>And Universal Empire give to Spain:</br>With fruitless Toil, for Belgia you contend,</br>While Albion's Queen does still fresh Succours send;</br>That raging Fire, you hope in vain to tame,</br>While Forreign Fuel still renews the Flame.</br>Eliza's Troops protect the Rebel State,</br>And still new Labour for your Arms create.</br>These Forreign Mounds, the Belgick State secure,</br>And stop the advancing Tide of Spanish Pow'r.</br>Would you your Glory with Success pursue,</br>Britannia's Kingdom you must first subdue;</br>Advance your Arms, and with one noble Blow,</br>Cut off the Spring, whence all your Suff'rings flow.</br>Equip your potent Fleet, embark your Arms;</br>Shake impious Britain, with your loud Alarms:</br>Transport your matchless Troops with speedy Care,</br>And thunder on her Coasts with unexpected War:</br>You will surprize the unprovided Isle;</br>An easy Conquest, and prodigious Spoil,</br>Will recompence your Hazard, and your Toil.</br>Rome's Holy Father will his Aid afford,</br>Bless all your Troops, and Consecrate your Sword:</br>He will your glorious Undertaking own,</br>And from Eliza's Head transfer the Crown:</br>Her Subjects Oaths he'll piously absolve,</br>And all her Friends in mortal Guilt involve:</br>He'll send his Thunder from his Sacred Tow'r,</br>And on her Head destructive Curses pour;</br>For Impious Hereticks, and such, 'tis known,</br>Eliza is, have forfeited their Crown.", "Kind Heav'n has rais'd you to Imperial Sway;</br>What num'rous Nations do your Laws obey?</br>By Land your Armies neighbour States controul;</br>By Sea your Navies run from Pole to Pole,</br>As far as Winds can fly, or Billows roll.</br>You some Returns of Gratitude should make,</br>And for kind Heav'n's, and for Religion's sake,</br>This pious Labour you should undertake.</br>This glorious Stroke will Heresy confound,</br>And give the odious Fiend a deadly Wound;</br>Will re-establish Rome's Imperial Pow'r,</br>Re-build her Altars, and her Priests restore,</br>Who with their Tears and Pray'rs your Aid implore.</br>Thousands of Holy Catholicks, that groan</br>Beneath th' Oppression of Eliza's Throne,</br>Will join their Arms to pull th' Oppressor down.", "When you vouchsaf'd to ask her for your Bride,</br>Can you forget how she, (prodigious Pride!)</br>Long with collusive Arts, your Passion fed;</br>But still despis'd so great a Monarch's Bed?</br>Britannia's Queen, as to the World is known,</br>To your Protection, owes her Life and Throne:</br>Yet does she succour your Invet'rate Foes,</br>Rebels protect, and your just Arms oppose.</br>If Albion you invade, you must succeed;</br>Just Heav'n will prosper, and applaud the Deed.</br>Batavia then deserted, must submit,</br>And lay her humble Neck beneath your Feet.</br>Thus o'er Europa you'll in Triumph reign</br>Lord of the Land, and Master of the Main:</br>Will gain immortal Honour and Renown;</br>And when you lay your Earthly Scepter down,</br>Will wear above, a bright Coelestial Crown.", "Then from beneath her Gown, the Fury drew</br>A Fire-brand partly Red, and partly Blew,</br>Kindled in Caves, in whose Recesses dwell</br>The most malignant Flames, and sharpest Fires of Hell;</br>Which secretly she with unerring Art,</br>Did at the Bosom of King Phillip dart:</br>That done, the Fury hast'ning to be gone,</br>Dissolv'd in Air, th' Appearance not her own;</br>No more the Object of the Monarch's Sight,</br>She to Britannia's Coast designs her Flight.", "Th' insinuating Flame his Veins possest,</br>And with Infernal Heats inspir'd the Monarch's Breast:</br>His Blood boil'd high, and on th' impetuous Tide</br>Wild Fury seated, did in Triumph ride:</br>His Pulse beat swift, his lab'ring Heart in Pain,</br>Did the uneasy Task of Life sustain.</br>He greater Rage, and more Disorder show'd,</br>Than in Iberian Princes is allow'd;</br>From the fierce Fury's Flame, this strange Emotion flow'd.</br>In this Disturbance, from his Bed he rose,</br>To vent his Passion, and his Thoughts compose.</br>Sometimes he walk'd, and cast his Eyes around;</br>Sometimes he stood, and fixt them on the Ground.</br>Oft clinch'd his Hands, and with an angry Look,</br>He now the Wall, and now the Portal strook.</br>With sudden Starts, walk'd swiftly to the Door,</br>Then turn'd as quick, and stampt upon the Floor.", "Some painful Hours the furious Monarch past</br>In this distracted manner, 'till at last</br>His Passion's high uncustomary Tide</br>Began to ebb, and by degrees subside.</br>The raging Tempest partly over-blown,</br>He to a Temper cool'd more like his own.</br>For tho' in Cruelty he did surpass</br>The fiercest Bigots of th' Iberian Race;</br>Yet was his Malice inward, cool, sedate,</br>And intellectual, more than passionate.</br>He with a Judgment more consistent, weigh'd</br>The Application by Ignatius made.</br>He saw, this high Design should he pursue,</br>What Acquisitions would from thence accrue,</br>And what the Dangers were, that might ensue.</br>What Profit to Religion, and to Rome;</br>What would to God, and what to Caesar come.</br>Britannia to subdue, were to ensure</br>The Western World's Submission to his Pow'r:</br>Then uncontroul'd Iberia would command</br>The Ocean by her Fleets, and by her Troops the Land.</br>Then Rome's Religion would exalt her Head,</br>On Nothern Heresy Triumphant tread,</br>And by the Sword supported, be by all obey'd.</br>But Heav'n's bright Glory, and immortal Crown,</br>That by his pious Arms might now be won:</br>Much with the superstitious Monarch weigh'd,</br>And more his Mind, than temporal Honour sway'd.</br>While all the Hazards which he had in view,</br>Against the Profit weigh'd, were light and few.</br>Thus having all things in his Mind revolv'd,</br>He Albion to invade, at last resolv'd.", ""]
