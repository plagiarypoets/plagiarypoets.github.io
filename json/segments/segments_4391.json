["The Eve the Sun went down in golden clouds,</br>A breath of violets was on the air,</br>The Robin's first sweet voice was in the woods,</br>In deeper splendour flush'd the Evening Star,</br>The Moon on the horizon's curve afar,</br>Pour'd on the sleeping stream a richer glow,</br>Laving its beams like silver bar on bar</br>On some smooth treasure floor; the stream's still flow</br>Reflected every Star, and was a Heaven below.", "Why was this peaceful pomp of Earth and Heaven?</br>'Twas at this hour our first fair mother gave</br>Her hand in Paradise, &mdash; and since that even</br>No wilder air must wander on the wave</br>Than the young violet's breath, on cliff and cave</br>The first bird sings, the cloudless Moon beams shine</br>To guide the lover, love's delighted slave&mdash;</br>To meet his beauty at the wild-wood shrine,</br>For this is thy delicious eve &mdash; St. Valentine.</br>"]
