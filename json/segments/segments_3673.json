["Here lays his head upon the chair's hard back,</br>A youth for sleeping to this club well known;</br>Good nature smil'd at birth of honest Jack,</br>And Somnus mark'd him for her own.", "Good was his heart as e'er warm'd human clod,</br>Heaven did not fail a recompence to send;</br>He gave to company ('twas all he had) a nod,</br>In each acquaintance he held fast a friend.", "No father seek his merits to disclose,</br>Nor draw his frailties, if any, forth to light;</br>Let him and them in slumbering ease repose,</br>Lost to the pleasures of a jovial night.</br>"]
