["Hence noise and tumult, pomp and power</br>And vain fantastic joys;</br>Hence, hence away, to courts repair,</br>Where the gay scene of trifling toys</br>To folly's votaries, ever dear,</br>Consume the precious hour:</br>Far, far from these, let me remove,</br>To some sequester'd cot;</br>Where unconfin'd the bard may rove,</br>Pleas'd with his happier lot:</br>Where solitude, companion meet,</br>And sage reflection, ever sweet,</br>With contemplation, most to chuse</br>Attracts the heav'n devoted muse;</br>Who scorning low, and trifling themes,</br>Romantic tales or idle dreams;</br>Delights to range, or thro' the wood,</br>Or o'er the lawn, in pensive mood,</br>To meditate on all that's good.</br>What rapture through the lonely walk</br>To stray, and with the druids talk;</br>Through moss-grown wilds, so hoar I deem,</br>So far remote, they sacred seem:</br>Here lay me by the lucid streams</br>Immers'd in more than mortal dreams,</br>Or silent sit, with stedfast eye</br>Pore o'er the brook that bubbles by;</br>Revolving former scenes of folly,</br>Indulging sacred melancholy;</br>Or wand'ring o'er my follies past,</br>Resolve that those shall be my last.</br>"]
