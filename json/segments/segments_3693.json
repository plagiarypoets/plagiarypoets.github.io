["The lark carols high on the morn;</br>The mountain ash waves in the breeze;</br>Fair Summer revisits the lawn&mdash;</br>But I have no pleasure in these:", "The Sun's peeping far in the East;</br>The rivulet winds thro' the glen;</br>The owlet's dull hooting has ceas'd;</br>And the wood-nymphs are sporting again:", "But the rivulet sprinkles for thee</br>A freshness which I cannot share;</br>And what are the wood-nymphs to me,</br>Who lament that my Jenny's not here?", "I care not a whit for the beam</br>That chases the orient dew;</br>It may gild both the forest and stream,</br>And delight such a lover as you.", "Yet oh &mdash; if my Jenny were here,</br>To admire the lark's early song,</br>I would follow his flight thro' the air,</br>And intreat him the strain to prolong.", "The lawn's fairest flower I'd raise</br>To repose on the breast of my love,</br>And to Echo would babble her praise,</br>Who should tell it again to the grove.", "She comes &mdash; and the moss-rose appears</br>More sweet as she passes the plain;</br>Tho' its bosom is moisten'd with tears,</br>It seems to be smiling again:&mdash;", "Ah, no &mdash; 'tisn't she &mdash; in its birth</br>Thus again hath my happiness flown,&mdash;</br>Oh, Corydon, stifle your mirth,</br>Or leave me to wander alone.</br>"]
