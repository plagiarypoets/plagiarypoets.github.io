["Next to human lives, I delight in the memoirs of animals, such as Sir John Harington's account of his dog, Bungey, &mdash; or Cowper's of his hares, &mdash; perhaps I even prefer them to some mens and women's biographies. &mdash; I am not singular, however, in my bent. &mdash; Almost every poet, but Shakspeare above all, was a naturalist, &mdash; and so Titania describes him to her elves:&mdash;", "Let no wild things astonish him or fear him;&mdash;</br>But tell them all how mild he is of heart;</br>Tall e'en the timid hares go frankly near him,</br>And eke the wildest roes yet never start,&mdash;</br>Nor yet shall fawns into the thickets dart,</br>Nor wrens forsake their nests amongst the leaves,</br>Nor let the speckled thrush move far apart,&mdash;</br>But bid the sacred swallows haunt his eaves</br>To guard his roof from lightning and from thieves;&mdash;", "And when he goes, the nimble squirrel's visitor,</br>Let the brown hermit show his hoarded nuts,</br>For tell thm this is Nature's kind inquisitor,&mdash;</br>Tho' men keep cautious doors that conscience shuts,</br>(For conscious wrong all curious quest rebuts,)</br>But bees shall not unsheathe their jealous stings,</br>However he may watch their straw-hatch'd huts,</br>So let him learn the crafts of all quaint things</br>Which he will hint most aptly when he sings.&mdash;", "And those who recall his description of a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle, &mdash; or of the temple-hunting martlet, by its mansionary proving that the air is delicate, &mdash; may judge if he was a materialist in vain. . . .</br>"]
