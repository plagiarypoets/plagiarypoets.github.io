["On every side, far as the eye could see,</br>'Twas one wide, wild, expanse of living green,</br>Fading in distance, till it seemed to be</br>Lost in a mild blue sky's descending sheen;</br>Here smooth as waveless ocean, and there seen</br>To rise in gentle undulations; all</br>Was motionless and still as nought had been</br>To break the listening silence, save the call</br>Of gently murmuring wood to distant water fall.", "Far in the west, a ridge of mist which shone,</br>Lit by the sun's fresh beams, a wave of fire,</br>Told where the winding Genesee rolled on,</br>Through vales as lovely as did erst inspire</br>Thy bards, proud Greece, or, England, wake thy lyre,</br>Thro' vales then wild, where now the clustering vine</br>Mantles the elm, the home of woodland quire,</br>Beneath whose umbrage countless flocks recline,</br>Its waters dark, to mix, Ontario, with thine.", "And northward far, thy sheeted lake serene</br>Shone like a purple cloud, which oft doth lie</br>Calmly, and mild as hope's unalter'd mien,</br>When the dim landscape fades in distant sky,</br>Oh 'tis a sight to win a seraph's eye!</br>And I have loved its deep tranquility,</br>Have gazed upon it, till a gentle sigh</br>Of happiness stole forth, and peacefully</br>My softened spirit sunk in sweet serenity.", "And didst thou place it there, great God, to show</br>An image of celestial loveliness?</br>To mock the strife and mad turmoil, which throw</br>A blight around us, and each joy oppress?</br>How beautiful!  Oh it hath power to bless!</br>The strife-worn bosom with a throb of heaven,</br>Did soothing thoughts upon its musing press,</br>Distant, revenge and hate afar be driven,</br>And every foe forgot, and every wrong forgiven.</br>"]
