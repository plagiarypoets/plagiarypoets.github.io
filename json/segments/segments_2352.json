["When sorrow presses on the care-worn breast,</br>And wakes to agony the nerve of pain;</br>When recollection paints the scenes once blest,</br>And the soul sickens at the vapid train</br>Of earth's delusive hopes, false, mutable, and vain:", "When sickness palls each effort to remove</br>The gloom of languor from the hour of care;</br>Blest be the impulse, which, from heav'nly love,</br>Leads the sad mourner to the house of pray'r</br>To seek the dawn of peace, the source of comfort there!", "There to pour out the heart which pants for rest,</br>With fervour kindling at Devotion's fane,</br>To him whose holy influence the breast,</br>By woe subdu'd, with firmness can sustain,</br>And where wild sorrows throbb'd, bid peace all soothing reign.", "And there the humble supplication raise,</br>Th' unutter'd pray'r, which sighs to be forgiv'n;</br>Or join to swell the grateful note of praise,</br>While the rapt soul, no more by tempest driv'n,</br>From hope's mild op'ning dawn, anticipates her heav'n.", "There, too, to listen to the sacred lore,</br>When heav'n-taught wisdom truths sublime display;</br>Blest truths!  which teach the suff'ring soul to soar</br>Above the toils of this drear, rugged way,</br>And seek, beyond yon radiant skies, still brighter day.", "O!  hope triumphant!  sorrow's blest relief!</br>Still o'er my soul diffuse thy balm divine:</br>Bid her press forward though the storms of grief,</br>Strew the dark path to death's allotted line;</br>Beyond, conceiveless joys, and ever during, shine.</br>"]
