["\"Yes, these are the meadows, the shrubs and the plains,</br>Once the scene of my pleasures, the scene of my pains;\"</br>Where oft with ELIZA I gaily did rove,</br>Who amply requited a parent's kind love:</br>\"But be still, my fond heart, thy emotions give o'er;\"</br>'Tis impious to think thou shalt see her no more.", "How oft in the corn-fields with her have I stray'd,</br>And cull'd the wild flow'rets to please the dear maid,</br>Who delighted tripp'd homewards the spoil to divide</br>With a parent enraptur'd to walk by her side:</br>But be still, my fond heart, thy emotions oh cease!</br>The skies have reclaim'd her, and she is at peace.", "What pleasure to view her mind daily expand,</br>Her sense to improve, and with wit at command!</br>For the Muses inspir'd her infantine lay,</br>But too soon droop'd the blossom, and hope fled away:</br>Yet be still, my fond heart, thy emotions restrain,</br>The bliss that surrounds her shall soften thy pain.", "With tender compassion all Nature she view'd,</br>And to her in vain the distressed never su'd;</br>To her friends with affection her heart overflow'd,</br>While her soul with celestial piety glow'd.</br>Then be still, my fond heart, thy Creator implore,</br>That again we may meet &mdash; and to lose her no more.</br>"]
