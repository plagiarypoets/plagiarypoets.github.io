["Beholding here below his scatter'd rays,</br>My soul a spark emitted from his fire,</br>Would fain attempt creation's Sun to praise,</br>Song far transcending loftiest Angels lyre!</br>And right it is toward him I should aspire,</br>Wise Architect!  who form'd my sight and tongue!</br>Children will lisp their fondness for a sire,</br>E'en by the birds to him are carols sung.</br>This theme shall flourish ever fair and young,</br>Unfading glories bloom in Paradise;</br>Ye mortal Poets, let your harps be strung</br>To deathless strains, to chant your Maker wise;</br>Awful in thunder, beauteous in each flow'r,</br>The world's great harmonist, and source of pow'r.</br>"]
