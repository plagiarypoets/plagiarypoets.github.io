["CICELY.</br>Ah well-a-day, in this same gap,</br>I lately sat in Cuddy's lap,</br>Cuddy, the neatest, blythest, swain,</br>That e'er tripp'd featly o'er our plain:</br>He's gone, and left me here forlorne,</br>Ah woe is me!  I deeply mourn;</br>The tears flow trickling from each eye,</br>So fast, I sure shall weep them dry:</br>He's gone I ween to meet with Sue,</br>Ah!  what mun slighted Cicely do?", "But see, o'er yonder hill I spy,</br>Is it not Cuddy's coming nigh?</br>I'll run and meet him with a kiss,</br>Sure Cuddy'l ne'er take that amiss.", "CUDDY.</br>What Cicely!  how I joy to see</br>My pretty Cicely meeting me:</br>Have I, my Cicely, still thy heart,</br>Or does some other share a part?</br>Thy Cuddy's faithful still, and true,</br>May I hope Cicely is so too?", "CICELY.</br>Sly Cuddy, how does Sukey fare?</br>She has your love &mdash; You've none to spare.", "CUDDY.</br>Whom?  Sukey!  The poor silly creature</br>Has neither wit, nor beauteous feature.</br>First view thyself &mdash; then think of she,</br>Who spreads as wide as o'ergrown tree.</br>No surely, &mdash; I've a better taste,</br>Why I can span my Cicely's waist,</br>Then who wou'd Cice for Sue forsake</br>A greyhound might for hedge-hog take.", "CICELY.</br>Ah, Cuddy, don't deceive me there,</br>I ne'er did you, I vow and swear.</br>Ha'st got my buckles in your shoe,</br>Or han you gave them happier Sue?", "CUDDY.</br>Han you my garter on your knee?</br>Sweet lovely Cicely, let me see.", "CICELY.</br>Fye, Cuddy, fye, no rudeness shew,</br>I'll ne'er admit it, that you know.</br>Ha'st got, my Cud, thine oaten reed?</br>Let's both go sit in yonder mead,</br>We'll play, and sing, a roundelay,</br>And spend most chearfully the day;</br>My good old dame left me some pelf,</br>And Cud shal have it all himself,</br>If he to me, will ween his plight,</br>We'll both live happy, day, and night.</br>"]
