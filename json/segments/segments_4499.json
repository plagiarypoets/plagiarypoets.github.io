["An oak, with spreading branches crown'd,</br>Beheld an ivy on the ground,</br>Expos'd to every trampling beast,</br>That roam'd around the dreary waste.</br>The tree of Jove, in all his state,</br>With pity view'd the ivy's fate;</br>And kindly told her, she should find</br>Security around his rind:</br>Nor was that only his intent,</br>But to bestow some nourishment.", "The branches saw, and griev'd to see</br>Such juices taken from the tree.</br>Parent, say they, in angry tone,</br>Your sap should nourish us alone:</br>Why should you nurse this stranger plant,</br>With what, your sons, in time, may want?</br>May want to raise us high in air,</br>And make us more distinguish'd there.", "'Tis well &mdash; the parent-tree reply'd;</br>Must I, to gratify your pride,</br>Act only with a narrow view</br>Of doing good to none but you?</br>Know, sons, tho' Jove hath made me great,</br>I am not safe from storms of fate.</br>Is it not prudent then, I pray,</br>To guard against another day?</br>Whilst I'm alive, you crown my head;</br>This graces me alive, and dead.</br>"]
