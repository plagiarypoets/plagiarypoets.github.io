["How oft have I curst in my mind</br>My wretched deplorable state;</br>No ease nor contentment I find,</br>For Chloe's still to me ingrate.", "She frowning refuses to hear</br>The humble request of her swain;</br>My hope's intercepted with fear,</br>My kindnesses meet with disdain.", "What scenes of unlimited woe</br>Her cruelty pours on my head!</br>What pains I for her undergo,</br>When sorrows encompass my bed!", "Each shepherd that pipes on the plain</br>His Phillis can please and delight;</br>Attentive she hears his soft strain;</br>But Chloe poor Strephon does slight.", "My flame it was ardent and just;</br>My bosom with tenderness glow'd;</br>My heart the sincerest, I trust,</br>That e'er was on mortal bestow'd.", "But since that my Chloe's unkind,</br>Adieu to the charms of the fair;</br>Some place I'll endeavour to find,</br>To breathe out my sorrow and care.", "No more will I frolic and rant,</br>But pensive I'll be as the dove;</br>No more shall the music enchant</br>My soul with the raptures of love.", "Ye banquets of pleasure adieu!</br>No more will I taste of your cheer;</br>But in this deplorable hue</br>To the shades of oblivion will steer.</br>"]
