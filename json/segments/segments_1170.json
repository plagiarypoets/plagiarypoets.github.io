["Sweet flow thy numbers, Oh!  ingrateful fair,</br>And tuneful error marks thy polish'd rhyme;</br>But know tho' mine to give the silver hair,</br>'Twas thy own Thyrsis, beg'd the boon of Time;</br>Thyrsis high glowing yet in manhood's hour,</br>Who prematurely sought an earnest of my pow'r,", "Mov'd by his pray'r those wintry wreaths I wove,</br>Twisting my snow-drops with the rose of youth;</br>But still 'twas Thyrsis's gentle fraud to prove</br>His Daphne's friendship, and his Daphne's truth:</br>\"Oh!  strew thy partial whiteness, thus he said,</br>Oh!  let thy snowy symbols strait invest my head.", "\"So shall I see, if chill'd by thy advance,</br>She with life's summer moment's shall recede;</br>So shall I see, if with youth's fleeting glance,</br>From age's menace, Daphne too shall speed.</br>So shall I triumph if I find the fair,</br>Defy the snowy wreaths, the monuments of care.\"", "Then wherefore tyrant?  Fair ingrate 'tis mine,</br>When falls man's short-liv'd blossom of an hour,</br>To touch affection with a bloom divine,</br>And proud expand truth's never-dying flower,</br>To lift fair constancy to seats sublime,</br>E'en 'bove myself &mdash; above the pow'rs of Time.", "Ah!  then let mem'ry and the Muses know,</br>Thou lovely satyrist shouldst bless my reign;</br>My pow'rs alone could deathless charms bestow,</br>Which prov'd the fondness that inspir'd thy strain.</br>Since but for those white omens of my sway,</br>The world had wanted Daphne's faithful lay.</br>"]
