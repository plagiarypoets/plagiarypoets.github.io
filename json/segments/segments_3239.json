["Farewell, dear France!  my sad heart's chosen home,</br>Land of my earliest joys, a last farewell!</br>Still o'er thy shores mine eyes delighted roam.</br>But ah!  the cruel winds the white sails swell;</br>And, when tomorrow dawns, my look shall dwell</br>Only upon the rushing waves that bear</br>My bark too swiftly on to reach its port of care!", "Alas!  alas!  till now I never knew</br>How sharp might be the thorns that line a crown!</br>Oh!  wo is mine that thus am doomed to view,</br>At once, the smile of fortune and her frown,</br>And find my spirit in the dust cast down,</br>When pride would bid me think on queenly state,</br>And spurn 'mid glory's dreams the humbler ills of fate!", "Yet ah!  how can the mournful widow's heart</br>Turn to the joys ambition might awake?</br>Doomed from the husband of my youth to part,</br>What pleasure now in glory can I take?</br>When most I prized it, 'twas for his dear sake&mdash;</br>My loftiest aim was but to share his throne;</br>How can my weak hand bear the sceptre's weight alone?", "Like yon pale moon must be my dreary way;</br>Lonely she shines, although so pure and bright,</br>And as she blends not with the sun's rich ray,</br>But waits his absence to diffuse her light,</br>So, only since my day has turned to night,</br>Has so much splendor gathered round my name&mdash;</br>Alas!  how happier far had I but shared his fame!", "But he is gone; and I his heavy loss,</br>Through many a lonely year, am doomed to weep.</br>Yet oft my thoughts the dark blue sea will cross,</br>To seek the spot where all I love doth sleep;</br>For in my husband's grave is buried deep</br>The all of joy that I could ever taste;</br>And glory but illumes my sad heart's blighted waste.</br>"]
