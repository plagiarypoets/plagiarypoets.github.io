["The ev'ning how calm it appears,</br>How tranquil!  how pleasant!  and cool;</br>From labour returning the steers,</br>Refresh at the green-crested pool.</br>Come, Celadon, pomp lay aside,</br>To grandeur no longer attend;</br>Thou foe to unciviliz'd pride,</br>To me thou unvarying friend.", "The shepherds sing carols of love,</br>The ploughmen are blithe on their way;</br>The turtles soft coo in the grove,</br>The green is all jocund and gay;</br>With music re-echoes the glade,</br>The valley with harmony rings;</br>The tabor and pipe in the shade</br>Make the rustics as happy as kings:", "In friendship together we'll walk,</br>And mark the decline of the day,</br>With chearfulness wander and talk,</br>Till Phoebus withdraw his last ray.</br>Then to my lov'd cottage repair,</br>And share the convivial glass;</br>What pleasure to hear you declare</br>The charms of your favourite lass.</br>"]
