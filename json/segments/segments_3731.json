["Not ceaseless falls the heavy shower,</br>That drenches deep the furrow'd lea;</br>Nor do continual tempests pour</br>On the vex'd Caspian's billowy sea;</br>Nor yet the ice in silent horror stands,</br>Thro' all the rolling months, on cold Armenia's lands.", "Fierce storms do not for ever bend</br>Gargania's vast and labouring oak;</br>Nor from the ash its foliage rend</br>With ruthless whirls, and widowing stroke;</br>But, Valgius, thou, with grief's eternal lays,</br>Mournest thy vanish'd hopes in Mystes' shorten'd days.", "When Vesper trembles in the west,</br>Or flies before the rapid sun,</br>Rise the lone sorrows of thy breast,</br>Not thus did aged Nestor shun,</br>Consoling strains, nor always sought the tomb,</br>Where sunk his filial hopes in life, and glory's bloom.", "Not thus, the lovely Troilus slain,</br>His parents wept the princely boy;</br>Nor his fair sisters mourn'd in vain</br>The blasted flower of sinking Troy.</br>Then cease thy fond complaints &mdash; Augustus' fame,</br>The new Cesarian wreaths let thy lov'd voice proclaim!", "So shall the listening world be told,</br>Medus, and froze Niphates, guide</br>(With all their mighty realms control'd)</br>Their late proud waves in narrower tide;</br>That in scant space their steeds the Scythians rein,</br>Nor dare transgress the bounds our victor arms ordain!</br>"]
