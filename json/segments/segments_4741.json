["Me often times the dark-brown'd wood</br>Invites when in a sober mood,</br>Where deep amid the twilight shade</br>Musing I roam the sylvan glade;</br>Or reclin'd in leafy bower,</br>I woo the sweetly soothing power</br>Of Contemplation's sacred fire,</br>To raise my dull phantasy higher,</br>And open to my mental sight</br>Fairest visions of delight.</br>A new Arcadia spreads around</br>O'er all the wide enchanted ground.</br>Where purest rivers softly flow,</br>And trees with constant verdure grow.</br>I see the vast extensive plan</br>Of happiness design'd for man,</br>When he to meet the great design,</br>His stubborn will he doth resign</br>Unto the will of Him who knocks</br>At hard'ned hearts untill his locks</br>Are wet with humid dews of night,</br>So constantly he doth invite.</br>I see, as ancient Seers foretold,</br>The wolf and lamb dwell in the fold:</br>The leopard and the kid are laid</br>Peaceful together in the shade;</br>Thus comes the happy halcyon day,</br>When cruel men, those beasts of prey,</br>Weary of war and hateful strife,</br>Shall learn to value human life.</br>Young lions tame with calves I see,</br>And fatlings all in harmony:</br>So gentle are they and so mild,</br>I see them led by a young child;</br>Thus shall the children of the great,</br>Descend from their exalted state,</br>And mix with those of low degree,</br>In virtue and equality.</br>The cow and bear together feed</br>Near both their young ones in the mead,</br>And men of a rough savage mind,</br>Become domestic and refin'd,</br>And all their children shall be brought</br>To Zion, and with hers be taught.</br>Now the fierce lion's hungry maw,</br>Ox-like is fill'd with simple straw;</br>Thus kings and heroes humbled low,</br>Aspiring passions shall forego,</br>And learn with other men to share</br>Nature's gifts as common fare;</br>Then rapine and oppression cease,</br>And all the Nations live in peace.</br>"]
