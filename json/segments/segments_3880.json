["Thy fane, AUBERT, with reverence I view,</br>And hail its noble use and sacred store;</br>Such as MINERVA'S temples never knew,</br>Nor all the ancient world with all its lore.</br>Here heavenly truth, and solid science charm,</br>Here Arts divine new faculties supply;</br>Mechanic powers give more than giant's arm;</br>And optics furnish more than eagle's eye:</br>Eyes which explore Creation's wondrous laws,</br>And teach us to adore the great designing cause.", "On these strong wings we mount ethereal space,</br>The wide machine of Heaven minutely scan;</br>GOD'S wisdom, power, and handy-work we trace,</br>The noblest privilege of little man.</br>New systems croud upon us as we climb,</br>Each star supports a train of circling spheres</br>Which run their stated rounds in punctual time,</br>Nor miss a moment in ten thousand years,</br>Perpetual motion in Heaven's high works maintain,</br>Which human art must imitate in vain.", "Then hail thy taste, sublime and skilful hand,</br>Which raised a fane those wonders to survey;</br>No private edifice so truly grand,</br>Few kings such heavenly treasure can display.</br>Nor should the muse disdain that rural grace</br>Which marks and decorates surrounding scenes.</br>May lasting beauties deck the learned place,</br>And laurels grow, and sacred ever greens;</br>And may unfading honours grace thy name,</br>And true ambition emulate thy fame!</br>"]
