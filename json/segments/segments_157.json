chalenge bold;</br>The time being come forth came the lustie Horse</br>With comely grace to runne th' expected course,</br>Who by his stately gesture gan to show</br>Stout signes in proud contempt of his base foe.</br>His crested necke hee often bow'd to ground</br>With foaming mouth as if he would confound</br>The earth at once, and from his nosthrils came</br>A fierie breath as from a furnace flame;</br>His pricking Eares stood startling on his head</br>And of a common custome inlye bred,</br>In jollity of pride which did abound,</br>His hollow hoofe still played upon the ground;</br>At last from his strong necke in neighing shrill</br>With sound thereof the Forrest hee did fill,</br>Seeming thereby to call upon Sir Asse,</br>That in this challenge the appellant was.</br>Who vainely vaunting with a gallant trayne</br>Came proudly prauncing on the ample Plaine;</br>Where when hee came beholding well the Horse</br>His comely grace, brave shape, and wondrous force:</br>Halfe in despaire hee did himselfe repent</br>Of his proud challenge and bold hardiment.", "Yet with the vayne applause of flattering mates</br>Being proudly prickt, with Courage bold he waites,</br>The time appointed to begin the race</br>Before the Forrest King being then in place;</br>The signe once given, Sir Asse, began to runne</br>With greedy hope great fame thereby t' have wonne.</br>But the brave Horse in pace away did goe</br>Like winged shaft shot from a Tuscan bowe,</br>Or like a Swallow in the welkin bright</br>That sheeres the subtle ayre with nimble flight,</br>Leaving the sluggish Asse with shame behind</br>To know himselfe to be an Asse by kind.</br>With mickle laughter bred in every place</br>Amongst the beasts that stood to see the race,</br>Which the Ape did well observe with slye intent</br>As he that knew, what would be the event;</br>For when the Asse, amongst the better sort</br>Was held in base contempt throughout the Court,</br>And left forlorne for his stupidity</br>The Ape alone, did keepe him company.</br>Whose doltish nature by his cunning wit</br>In all his actions done he did so fit,</br>That in the end by craft and cousening slye</br>Hee gull'd the simple beast and suckt him dry.</br>Who left forlorne returned all a mort</br>Unto his Country home, from Princes Court.</br>There helpelesse to bewaile in wofull wise</br>His lavish will and wanton riotize;</br>O wretched end of idle vanity,</br>Of misexpence and Prodigality.</br>You younger wits that spend your golden houres,</br>Your selves and substance in great Princes bowers;</br>That quaffe downe Court delights, and dayly swill</br>The seeming sugred Nectar of your ill;</br>That weare your large left patrimonies bare</br>In Drinke, in Dice, Dauncing and dainty fate.</br>That up and downe in Antick shapes doe jet,</br>And on your golden backs doe beare your debt,</br>And with a vaine bewitching hope struck blind</br>Of idle fame doe watch to catch the wind,</br>Yet thinke your selves all others to surpasse</br>In reaching wit.  Behold this forlorne Asse,</br>Who 'mongst the best, once jolly blithe and trim</br>In deepest waves of sweet delight did swim;</br>Now of his golden good he being bereft</br>And driven home, when scarce no home was left:</br>In stead of stately bower, where he had bin</br>An homely Cottage gladly enters in.</br>Where with sad sighes his wretched eyes doe fill</br>In stead of Arras and sweet paintings skill,</br>Upon the broken roofe and slender walls</br>Sticks smoakie black and Spiders dusty coales,</br>In stead of sweet perfumes, the bitter smoake</br>With foggy clouds his tender sight doth choake,</br>In stead of Silver plate, or purest Glasse</br>Hee with the Beggers dish now pleased was,</br>In which for Wine to glad his wofull hart</br>Hee takes cold Whey and water in good part,</br>His Courtly dyet fraught with many a dish</br>Of divers kindes of dainty Flesh and Fish,</br>Is now become the almes of some good house</br>Or homely morsell of some hungry Mouse.</br>The ground his board, greene grasse his Carpet makes</br>And for his Bed a pad of Straw he takes</br>In which distresse, by his owne folly bred</br>Hee weeps, he sighes, and shakes his wofull head;</br>Blaming his bitter Fate, but all in vaine</br>Since of his wealthy store naught doth remaine.</br>Meane time the Ape that liv'd upon his losse</br>Seeing the wretched fortune of the Asse,</br>Did laugh to scorne his wofull misery</br>And pitch'd his nets with fraud and subtilty;</br>To circumvent the weake and simple sort</br>That used to frequent the Princes Court.</br>But thus while th' Ape such things to passe did bring</br>About the pallace of the Forrest King</br>The greedy Wolfe his part did also play</br>In woods abroad t' obtaine his wished pray,</br>Who was a bloudy beast of wicked brood</br>And sought to live by spoyle of others good.</br>Yet had hee large possessions of his owne,</br>And in the woods was mighty wealthy growne,</br>Whereby he daily sought in Cruell wise</br>Upon the poorer Beasts to Tyrannize,</br>The Woods in Common, and th' adjoyning Plaine</br>Hee did convert unto his private gaine;</br>And meaner beasts that nigh his Den did dwell,</br>Hee from their owne abodes did oft expell.</br>'Mongst whom the Urchin and the Squirrill hight,</br>By the Apes helpe, he robbed of their right:</br>For in close thicket farre from sight of Sunne</br>Where in his darksome Den the Wolfe did wonne,</br>The industrious Urchin in his little Cell,</br>Not farre from thence alone did chance to dwell.</br>At whose good hap the Wolfe did much repine</br>And daily did behold with envious eyne,</br>How he in sharpest Winter did enjoy</br>The fruites of Sommers toyle without annoy;</br>For when Pomona did in winters scorne</br>The Woods greene heads with golden fruit adorne,</br>When fields doe seem to laugh, when flowers doe spring</br>When Beasts doe play, and Birds doe sweetly sing;</br>Then would the Urchin watch with curious eye,</br>When Boreas blasts did cuffe the Clouds in skye</br>And shake the Tree when like thicke showers of raine</br>The Fruit would fall, the which with mickle paine</br>Upon his brisled backe, the Urchin bore</br>Home to his Cell to make his winters store,</br>Whereby from winters thrall hee liv'd secure,</br>When other Beasts much sorrow did endure.</br>Now at the entry of the sterne Wolfes denne</br>The place of his abode had long time bin;</br>That 'gainst the State nought could be done or sayd,</br>But by the Urchin it might bee bewrayed.</br>The Wolfe likewise out of his greedy moode</br>Did seeke t' inlarge the place of his abode,</br>By proud incroaching of that little Cell</br>In which his neighbour, th' Urchin us'd to dwell;</br>Wherefore hee sought by death or some disgrace,</br>To dispossesse the Urchin of that place.</br>And on a time from home as th' Urchin went</br>Abroad into the Forrest with intent</br>As was his wont, to get such labours meed,</br>As Fortune in the Forrest had decreed.</br>Loe in the way the tavening Wolfe did watch</br>This silly beast within his pawes to catch,</br>Whom he did often thinke to make his prey,</br>Yet durst hee not at that time give th' Assay,</br>So well the Urchin did his body arme</br>With coate of proofe, 'gainst all intended harme.</br>The Wolfe therefore perceiving force to faile</br>Did seeke by flattering falshood to prevaile.</br>For in the way finding occasion meet</br>With fawning words, thus th' Urchin hee did greet.", "Now neighbour, quoth the Wolfe, you be well met</br>Upon what high atchievement be you set,</br>That you thus armed bee, seemes you doe stand</br>In dangers doubt, and feare some harme at hand.", "Nay certes, quoth the Urchin, nought I feare</br>Of harme t' ensue, this armed coate I weare</br>For no such cause; but that with paine I may</br>Upon my brisled hide, such fruit convay</br>To my poore home, which in the woods I find,</br>Least with the sluggard unto ease inclin'd,</br>On Summers pleasure I doe fondly feed,</br>And want in Winter to sustaine my need.", "The Wolfe replyed, y blessed be thy paine</br>And labour, that deserves to reape good gaine;</br>Yet let me now disswade thee to disarme</br>Thy selfe this once, and feare no future harme,</br>This day desist from toyle and goe with mee</br>Unto our friend, where wee will welcome bee;</br>For to all Beasts, this day is by the Bore</br>Kept festivall, where we shall finde good store</br>Of divers dainty Fruits, of which at will</br>Withouten labour thou mayest have thy fill.</br>This sayd, he used such kinde courtesie</br>Mix'd with such friendly Importunitie;</br>That the poore Urchin, thought his meaning good</br>And would with him unto the neighbouring Wood,</br>Whereas the Bore should wonne; but loe at need</br>A friend was by, to helpe him at that steed.</br>And sure the silly Urchin that same day</br>Unto the Ravening Wolfe had beene a prey,</br>But that the Squirrill from the leavie Tree,</br>Unseene to them the Wolfes intent did see;</br>Who to the Urchin, call'd with loude exclaime;</br>Fond foole said hee, what madnes is this same?</br>How darest thou credit that same cruell Beast,</br>That on thy Carkasse seekes to make his Feast.</br>Take heed, by his seducements bee not led,</br>If thou disarme thy selfe thou art but dead.</br>For hence I did behold how in the way</br>In secret covert hid, hee lurking lay,</br>And hadst thou not with stiffe quill'd pointed hide</br>Beene arm'd about; by him thou sure hadst dy'd.", "The Urchin hearing this, upon his chin</br>Did set his feet and drew his brisled skin</br>About his body round, as any ball</br>To shield himselfe, and shun his fatall fall.", "Which when the Wolfe perceiv'd, hee went his way</br>Inrag'd in minde, and vow'd without delay</br>To act a swift revenge upon them both,</br>And for his cause, unto the Ape he goeth;</br>To whom, Complaint against them he doth bring</br>To be preferr'd unto the Forrests King.</br>Hee told, how th' Urchin like a theevish wight</br>Did steale abroad in dead of darksome night,</br>Using to sucke the full-fed Kine unkept,</br>While the poore Neatheard all securely slept:</br>And how the Squirrill to augment his store,</br>Did rob the Forrest of the Fruit it bore;</br>And to his will, that he might better shape</br>The greedy fancy of the Begging Ape,</br>Hee wish'd him begge the forfeit of their Goods,</br>Since none amongst the Beasts about the woods</br>There was, with whom such treasure could be found</br>As with them twaine which chiefly did abound</br>With Nuts, and Aples, which the Wolfe could tell</br>Above all things, the Ape lov'd wondrous well.</br>And sooth to say these tidings did so please</br>Th' Apes greedy humor, that with little ease</br>The Wolfe obtain'd his wish for in small space</br>The Urchin and the Squirrill wanting grace</br>Of friends to backe their cause were from those Woods</br>Exil'd for aye, and forfeited there goods;</br>Whereby the Wolfe possession did obtaine</br>Of th' Urchins little Cell, and th' Ape did gaine</br>By begging Nuts and Aples which of yore</br>By others paines were hoarded up in store.</br>Thus dayly did the subtile Ape obtaine</br>Pleasure and profit both withouten paine,</br>By which I weene compar'd to all the rest</br>\"Amongst all Craftsmen Beggers are the best:\"</br>For ev'n the proud'st that thinkes paines taking's base</br>To turne oft Begger thinkes it no disgrace.</br>But whilest the Ape lull'd in security</br>Did swim in pleasures and felicity</br>Not wanting ought, for seldome did he crave</br>The guift of ought but he the same might have,</br>The noble Elephant that in the Court</br>Did beare chiefe sway amongst the supreame sort</br>Like a true Statesman, for the Forrest good</br>Against the Apes incessant begging stood.</br>Whereby the Ape did stoope his gallant minde</br>For though by information he might finde</br>Ought worthy begging, yet the Princes grant</br>Hee did not crave; because by th' Elephant</br>Oft to revoke his grant the King was mov'd</br>If to the state it prejudiciall stood;</br>Therefore the Ape that liv'd before secure</br>And thought his golden begging would endure</br>For ever certaine:  with a heavy cheere</br>Now hung the head; for well it did appeare</br>Hee might goe swinke and sweat to get his living</br>Since that the Forrest Prince did cease from giving,</br>Sir Reynald likewise that same crafty mate</br>That did in the Apes beg'd guifts participate</br>Now wanted meanes, whereby he might support</br>His bravery 'mongst the gallants of the Court</br>For long he watched had and cast about</br>By his fine wit to finde some purchase out</br>Some ancient Ruine of Antiquitie</br>Or ought that might be tearm'd inutilie,</br>But naught he found that in the Forrest stood</br>That was inutilie for common good,</br>Which when he did perceive:  halfe in despaire</br>Unto the Ape his friend he made repaire</br>Who to each other often though in vaine</br>Their sad mishap in secret did complaine.</br>Yet in the end the Fox did finde a fetch</br>\"For dire constraint, the wit at large doth stretch,\"</br>Hee well remembred that if any beast</br>Were found offensive to the Kings beheast</br>Or did infringe the Law through all the

the care the cunning Gardener takes</br>His hookes, his sythes, his pickaxe, spade and rakes,</br>Some fruitlesse weeds are growing on the ground:</br>So in our Kings owne Pallace may bee found</br>Amongst the number that praise-worthy bee</br>Some wicked Beasts of more then base degree.</br>And 'gainst such Vice, as they doe there support</br>Wee did inveigh; and not against the Court:</br>Ne did we say, that such have Beggers bin</br>That by desert doe Grace or favour winne:</br>But such as dayly use with restlesse gaping</br>With cloaked falsehood and with tedious begging</br>Of our dread Soveraignes golden guifts to crave</br>Although no merit in themselves they have;</br>This is the summe in briefe of what we spake</br>And this is it which they would treason make.\"</br>This said, dumbe silence for a certaine space</br>Did shut the lips of all that were in place</br>Till at the last, that great Heroe rose</br>Who of the Forrests treasure doth dispose</br>The noble Elephant, who as he stood</br>From his sweet mouth powr'd forth a fluent flood</br>Of honied eloquence, which wanting skill</br>If I expresse the same, soone should I spill</br>With sharpe invective, first against that sort</br>Of hungry Beggers that frequent the Court</br>Hee did inveigh, then by his powerfull wit</br>Hee shewed since he in Counsels seat did sit;</br>How many private States had changed bin</br>Which by observance he had mark't and seene,</br>Supplanted all by cousenage of the Ape</br>Or by some falsehood which the Fox did shape.</br>Then 'gainst the Ape, his speech he gan to frame</br>Hee shew'd what Beast he was and whence he came</br>How Jove at first, for his deceiptfull guile</br>Made him, of man a Beast, and in that Isle</br>Call'd Ape Isle of his name, alone him put</br>And how his taile at length for craft was cut.</br>Then question'd he the Fox, to know if hee</br>Against the Oxe and Sheepe would witnes bee</br>And what true depositions he could bring</br>That they intended treason 'gainst the King.</br>The Fox though halfe amaz'd with suddaine feare</br>To heare such words from such a mighty Peere,</br>Yet that his witnes might seeme more t' have troth</br>Hee did unbidden seeke to take his oath.</br>The booke was brought; but loe the Eternall Jove</br>Who by his power protecteth from above</br>The cause of Innocence, with dreadfull frowne</br>From Heav'ns high Palace cast his count'nance downe</br>And as the Foxe his oath began to take</br>As Jove but stirr'd, hee made Olympus shake,</br>And thundring horribly above the skie,</br>Through the ayre hee made a sulphurie flash to she,</br>Which fell upon the Foxe, for his foule sinne;</br>And for his judgement strange, so syng'd his skinne</br>That since, All Foxes smell of it and beare</br>A synged colour ever in their haire.</br>This suddaine change, amaz'd the standers by</br>Who all with one consent, gan glorifie</br>The name of Jove, and 's judgement forthwith gave</br>Against the Ape, who now no wit could save</br>From punishment; For 'bout the Forrest wide</br>They whipt him well, and soundly lasht his hide.", "So did the Begger bluntly end his Tale,</br>In which (your pardon I crave) if ought I faile</br>And if in reading, Beggerly you hold it,</br>Dislike it not, because a Begger told it.</br>"]
