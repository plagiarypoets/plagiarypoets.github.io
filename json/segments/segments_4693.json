["Hail, lovely harbinger of spring,</br>Sweet herald of the blooming May,</br>O!  how I'm charm'd to hear thee sing,</br>Dear songster of the flow'ry spray;</br>Nature enraptur'd hears thy voice,</br>The groves are charm'd, the smiling vales rejoice.", "Thine is the season of delight,</br>Thy notes revive the wak'ning flow'rs,</br>Thy ever charming songs invite,</br>Ere May leads on the smiling hours;</br>Joy ne'er salutes the youthful year,</br>Till in thy train the sportive loves appear.", "Gay are the flow'r-enamell'd vales;</br>What verdant foliage decks the green!</br>Sweet odours wing the balmy gales;</br>Love's smiles adorn the charming scene;</br>Now hoary winter sculks away,</br>And yields the sceptre to the lovely May.", "How sweetly swells the blackbird's note!</br>Sweet sing the woodlarks in the grove;</br>Hark how the linnet's tuneful throat</br>Warbles the melting strains of love!</br>But faintly strive the pinion'd choir,</br>Till the sweet Cuckoo strings the vernal lyre.", "Say, lovely guest, oh!  wilt thou stay!</br>Nor leave Britannia's favour'd isle,</br>So shall each joyful month be May,</br>Our landscapes wear the eternal smile:</br>Gladness still hail the new-born day,</br>And love shall bear an universal sway.", "Ah!  no, ere long thy pleasing note</br>No more shall make the groves resound;</br>No more the Cuckoo strain her throat,</br>And flow'rs shall cease to deck the ground;</br>Joy shall forsake the verdant lawn,</br>And mournful larks forget to hail the dawn.", "These charming sweets will shortly fade,</br>Bright summer must resign her crown,</br>Winter will soon these scenes invade,</br>Will soon resume its wonted frown:</br>(Ah!  gloomy scene) the tempests roar,</br>And warbling songsters charm the groves no more.", "Attend, fond youth! the lesson's thine,</br>Thus fly thy gay, thy heedless hours;</br>Alas!  thy bloom must soon decline,</br>And wither like the vernal flow'rs;</br>Thy May will shortly disappear,</br>And age will strew thy hoary paths with care.", "Let me employ the present hour,</br>In works of sweet benevolence,</br>So may I hail that heav'nly pow'r,</br>That Angel sent to call me hence:</br>My raptur'd soul shall wing its way,</br>To those blest climes where ev'ry month is May.</br>"]
