["At noontide, as Colin and Sylvia lay,</br>Within a cool jessamine bower,</br>A butterfly, wak'd by the heat of the day,</br>Was sipping the juice of each flower.", "Near the shade of this covert, a young shepherd lay,</br>The gaudy brisk flutterer spies,</br>Who held it as pastime to seek and destroy</br>Each beautiful insect that flies.", "From the lily he hunted this fly to the rose,</br>From the rose to the lily again:</br>Till, weary with tracing its motions, he chose</br>To leave the pursuit with disdain.", "Then Colin to Sylvia smilingly said,</br>Amyntor has follow'd you long;</br>From him, like the butterfly, still have you fled,</br>Tho' woo'd by his musical tongue.", "Beware in persisting to start from his arms,</br>But with his fond wishes comply;</br>Come, take my advice, or he's pall'd with your charms,</br>Like the youth with the beautiful fly.", "Says Sylvia, Colin, thy simile's just,</br>And yet to Amyntor I'm coy;</br>For I vow she's a simpleton blind that would trust,</br>A swain when he courts to destroy.</br>"]
