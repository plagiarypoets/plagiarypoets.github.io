["'Twas at a City-Feast for honours won</br>By Midas, Mammon's darling son,</br>Stuck up in solemn state</br>His purse-proud worship sat,</br>A sugar-cask his throne.</br>The wealthy Aldermen were plac'd around;</br>The least of whom was worth ten thousand pound;</br>So shou'd desert in industry be crown'd:</br>In all the pomp of Asia's pride,</br>There sat majestic Nabobs by his side,</br>Who the poor, prostrate Great-Mogul bestride:</br>Mighty!  mighty!  mighty band!</br>None but directors empires shou'd command.", "The more the feast to grace,</br>The city-music had their proper place,</br>Where to an antient harp new-strung,</br>A bard accompanying sung.", "His song began</br>With celebration of the man</br>Who, with noble thirst of glory fir'd,</br>To be a Member and Lord-May'r aspir'd;</br>But what was greater still,</br>With high protests and low-life'd words at will,</br>A famous orator he grew,</br>And all antagonists o'erthrew;</br>He speech'd it, rav'd, and bounc'd;</br>Till soon to bind his brows there was decreed</br>A garland of green oyster-weed,</br>While all, him God of Billingsgate pronounc'd.", "The listening croud catch at the striking sound;</br>A present deity!  the stucco roofs rebound:</br>Great Midas hears,</br>Elate appears,</br>Assumes the god,</br>Affects to nod,</br>And, bridling, shakes his ears.", "The praise of Plutus next enrich'd the strain,</br>The very worshipping of whom is gain:</br>The golden pagod, see!  in triumph comes:</br>Sound the trumpets!  beat the drums!</br>How bright his yellow face</br>Shines forth with a resistless grace!</br>Prepare your open palms; he comes!  he comes!</br>Plutus, ever winning, ever great,</br>The joy of hoarding did the first create:</br>Sublime the merit</br>Of such a spirit!</br>Plutus's blessings are in heaps of treasure:</br>Money-getting is a noble pleasure;</br>Rich the treasure</br>Sweet the pleasure,</br>Sweet the pleasure springs from gain.", "Though sooth'd and flatter'd with the strain,</br>Midas, high-rank'd among the money'd train,</br>Less avaritious still than vain,</br>Riches affected to disdain;</br>Which not quite grateful show'd</br>Where he his whole importance ow'd:</br>Then looking fine and bluff,</br>He swore he fortune had enough,</br>Peace and pension far above,</br>He courted nothing but the people's love;</br>Money he valued less than a good name;</br>And to confirm his claim,</br>Spoke all his speeches o'er again,</br>The frothy produce of a windy brain.", "The master sees the folly rise,</br>His swelling cheeks and starting eyes;</br>And while with bloated airs he sense defied,</br>Chang'd his note, and check'd his pride.", "A theme most pitiful he chose,</br>A theme replete with melting woes;</br>He sung of Midas's friend and great protector,</br>The patriot, orator, and hector,</br>(Of weathercocks oh!  wretched fate!)</br>Fall'n, fall'n, fall'n, fall'n!</br>Fall'n from the pinacle of state,</br>Where he perch'd had been of late,</br>Deserted, as he oft' had been of late,</br>By those of whom he once had been the admiration:</br>He now, alas!  while all men flout him,</br>With not a friend to care about him,</br>Dies, in a corner, like a poison'd rat.", "With downcast eyes the son of Mammon sat</br>Revolving on that foul disgrace,</br>Of levity the common case.", "The songster-bard well pleas'd to mark</br>Of sensibility some spark,</br>To cease his wild-goose chase of fame,</br>Wish'd him to understand</br>That often in this land</br>Vulgar and popular are quite the same:</br>The mob, he sung, were much abus'd</br>Who fair pretence too easily believ'd,</br>And if they chang'd, shou'd be excus'd,</br>They were not fickle then, but undeceiv'd.", "From pity next for his sad friend,</br>He moves him to the pity of himself,</br>Warning him not to split on the same shelf,</br>Nor labor hard t' atchieve no better end.</br>In the calm aeolian measure,</br>He sings, that virtue is true pleasure,</br>False honor but an empty bubble;</br>Vanity a toil and trouble;</br>A life so wretchedly employ'd</br>Cou'dn't well be call'd enjoy'd,</br>While not both Indies' wealth, nor vain expence,</br>Cou'd e'er true dignity bestow,</br>Or with a silly arrogance of brow</br>Supply the place of solid sense.", "The few applaud the well-meant song,</br>Unpleasing to a trivial throng:</br>From Mammon's son it no attention draws;</br>Reason, with him, was sure to lose her cause:</br>With native happiness oppress'd,</br>Nothing cou'd penetrate his callous breast;</br>Music, in vain, a deeper sound explores,</br>He yawns, nods, drops asleep, and snores.</br>"]
