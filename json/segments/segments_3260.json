["Happy the man whose weighty purse contains</br>Or yellow gold, pale silver, or the coin</br>Of ruddy copper; he on chearful thoughts</br>Enjoys a mental feast, nor pines with care.</br>The chink of gold with gold (transporting sound!)</br>Excels the timbrel, or the Syren's voice</br>Harmonious, or the whisper soft</br>Of Zephyr, warbled thro' the breathing flute</br>To sleeping Beauty, by assiduous Love,</br>In midnight serenade.  Gold, magic spell!</br>Secures from wants and woes, from bitter still</br>Extracts the sweets of life, and leaves the dregs</br>To Poverty and Me.  Say, favour'd youths!</br>When from the bag's wide mouth, or secret slit</br>Of fob, you conscious draw the glitt'ring gold,</br>What pride, what pleasure kindles in your breast!</br>Grief flies, nor Mem'ry, if she views, regrets</br>Home, happy seat of freedom and delight!</br>Where letter'd tyranny no more decries</br>The task laborious, but the vacant mind</br>Is free to ev'ry bliss, and lur'd by all,</br>Insatiate riots on parental love.", "But I nor join the gingling sport of chuck,</br>Nor chiming ring my coin, but debtor too,</br>Far from the tread of social foot, the shout</br>Of mingled joy, with slow and silent pace,</br>Alone thro' unfrequented glades I rove;</br>Lost in the mazes of distracting thought,</br>My mind too wanders, by no converse cheer'd.", "Thus, when the birds in sportive circles glide,</br>Or perch'd on some tall willow's bending top,</br>In joyful concert pour the blended strain;</br>The solitary bat, in chimneys dark,</br>Or hollow tree, absconds, nor dares enjoy</br>The noon-tide breeze of balmy spring; when eve</br>Steals o'er the fading landscape, thro' the gloom</br>She wings her solitary flight, while ghosts</br>Glide silent o'er the haunted green, or start</br>At the 'lone owl's shrill scream, ill-omen'd sound!", "But lo!  to sharpen pain with sights of bliss,</br>And scourge with Envy's scorpions, where, by years</br>Bent double, on her weary arm an hag</br>The leaden basket bears; tott'ring with haste,</br>And grinning she approaches:  see!  with joy</br>A welcome crowd surrounds her; money now</br>Bears off or nonpareil, or sweet permain,</br>Or rennet, golden fruit!  I, like the fam'd</br>Tho' wretched Tantalus, whom thund'ring Jove</br>Plung'd into hell's sulphureous deep abyss,</br>In midst of plenty, poor and meagre stand.</br>Yet Tantalus one wretched comfort boasts,</br>Society in woe; near him renew'd</br>Prometheus' liver, doom'd the living food</br>Of the still hung'ring vulture.  Sisyphus</br>Straining each nerve in unavailing toil,</br>Up the steep hill scarce moves the pond'rous stone.</br>Ixion, bound in galling chains, is whirl'd</br>Round with the restless wheel.  I, wretched I,</br>In Poverty, that complicated curse, sustain</br>The plague of each, no fellow suff'rer nigh.", "At night I quaff no sweet nectareous juice,</br>Nor laugh at merry pun nor jocund tale,</br>But, like the damn'd, when Orpheus charm'd the shades,</br>With face distorted screw a painful smile,</br>While others o'er the golden posset chat,</br>Whose yellow streams like fam'd Pactolus flow</br>Redundant, with a jug of small-beer flip,</br>Want's chearless potion, I deserted sit</br>Like meagre hermit in a gloomy grot,</br>With trees embower'd, and far from human sight.</br>To such retreat, from all things vile and vain,</br>The glare of wealth, and blandishment of joy,</br>O lead me, god of Silence!  hide me here</br>From Insolence and Scorn; where Poverty</br>Presides, the poor have peace.  Receive me, then,</br>Pale Goddess!  from the shine of gold I fly.</br>So, when the gaudy sun in glitt'ring car</br>Arises, lo!  afar the gloomy shades</br>Depart, and vanish from the rosy morn,</br>With chaos mixing and maternal night.</br>"]
