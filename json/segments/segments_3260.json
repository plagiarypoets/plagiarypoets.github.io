["By the side of the sweet river Tay,</br>Or else on the banks of the Tweed,</br>Young Colin he whistles all day,</br>Or merrily pipes on his reed.</br>His mind is a stranger to care,</br>For he is blithe, bonny, and free;</br>At harvest, at wake, and at fair,</br>No swain is so chearful as he.", "At eve, when we dance on the green,</br>How sprightly he joins in the throng;</br>So pleasing his air and his mien,</br>So gailey he trips it along;</br>The lasses his manners adore,</br>And strive his affections to gain,</br>When absent, for him they deplore,</br>All sigh for the smiles of the swain.", "But I am the girl of his mind,</br>He chose me above all the rest,</br>And vows that to me he'll be kind,</br>With me he will ever be blest.</br>The maidens all envy my bliss,</br>And tell me I'm simple and vain;</br>Yet I'm not displeased at this,</br>Nor heed their contempt and disdain.</br>"]
