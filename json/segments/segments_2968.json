["Sister of Youth and laughing Joy,</br>Sweet PLEASURE, Sorrow-soothing Queen,</br>Daughter of Venus, ever young,</br>And Bacchus wreath'd with Ivy green;</br>Whom on their Laps the rosy-bosom'd Hours,</br>And all the Graces nurst beneath Idalian Bow'rs.", "O lead me to thy blissful Vale!</br>Where Hope and Health in sprightly Round,</br>Leisure with Freedom Hand in Hand,</br>In Dance fantastic beat the Ground;</br>Where'er they tread while fairest Flowers arise,</br>Embroid'ring all the Green with ever-varying Dies.", "Let the stern Pedant love to waste</br>In studious Search the tedious Night,</br>Attentive to the learned Page,</br>By musing Taper's glimmering Light,</br>Whose pensive Ear no wakeful Sounds alarm,</br>Save the lone Owl, slow Clock, or Bell-man's drowsy Charm.", "Me let the chearful Dance engage,</br>Swift-urg'd along the lighted Dome;</br>While with new Warmth the Virgin glows,</br>Her Cheek all flush'd with fresher Bloom;</br>Motion and Musick tend'rest Thoughts inspire,</br>And all her yielding Soul relents to soft Desire.", "Let the sage Hermit shun Mankind,</br>With pale-ey'd Penitence to dwell,</br>To freeze at Midnight Hours of Pray'r</br>Within a solitary Cell;</br>Penurious on the verdant Herb to sup,</br>And of the chilling Stream to drain the Beechen Cup.", "Be mine, amid the social Band,</br>The Raptures of Champaign to taste,</br>Whose vig'rous Juice new Relish gives</br>To mutual Converse, Reason's Feast,</br>While old Anacreon seems to rise, and say,</br>\"Begone, ye Toils of Life; ye busy Cares, away!\"</br>"]
