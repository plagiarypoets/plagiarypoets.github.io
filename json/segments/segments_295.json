["CYMOTHOE, GLAUCUS.", "CYMOTHOE.</br>Think, Glaucus, you were once a fishing swain,</br>Till urg'd by potent herbs you left the plain;</br>That you were bred on earth, you fully prove,</br>And thence you know to feign deceitful love.</br>But think, ingrate, when first you hither came,</br>How strange you look'd, how awkwardly you swam.</br>When artless first you try'd the unknown sea,</br>I taught you how to plow the liquid way;</br>I show'd you all the secrets of the deep,</br>And vaulted rocks where weary Tritons sleep.</br>I show'd you islands yet unknown to men,</br>Where wanton Nereids meet, and sport unseen.</br>Oft have I wound in plaits the yielding reed,</br>And plac'd the well-wrought garland on your head.</br>Oft have I choicest fish with labour caught,</br>And the sweet prey to you a present brought.</br>To me in vain love-sick Palaemon cry'd,</br>While I regardless past with sullen pride;</br>Oft the kind youth would near Cymothoe swim,</br>And fondly ask, if I would bath with him.</br>Yet you, an earth-born wretch, ungrateful prove,</br>No more Cymothoe, but Cyano love;</br>Blue-ey'd Cyano love, that matchless fair,</br>Though flat her nose, and thin her falling hair;</br>The Nymph, whom most despise, and none admire,</br>Glaucus alone pursues with fond desire.</br>Since then I am (too credulous) betray'd,</br>I'll live no more a wretched worthless maid;</br>Since you are false, I'll leave the hated sea,</br>And yield my self to fishermen a prey.</br>I shall on shore be as a monster shown,</br>And trumpeted for pence through ev'ry Town,</br>While you well-pleas'd with lov'd Cyano toy,</br>And in some conscious cliff the beauteous Nymph enjoy.</br>Thus sadly plaining fond Cymothoe said,</br>And Glaucus thus appeas'd the angry maid.", "GLAUCUS.</br>Cymothoe wrongs her Glaucus, and her self,</br>To think I languish for that scaly elf.</br>The wanton Nymph indeed has often strove</br>To bribe my service, and engage my love,</br>With gifts of shining pearls, and thought to please</br>With coral twigs, and fragrant ambergris;</br>But still I sought the trifling maid to shun;</br>(Your love preserves what first your beauty won)</br>Nor shall I e'er that happy time forget,</br>When first I left my boat, and fishing-net;</br>And how you taught me artfully to swim,</br>To dive for pearls, and steepy rocks to climb;</br>You taught to hunt the shark, and boldly stride</br>The flouncing horse, and quell his foamy pride.</br>Believe not, Fair, that I can prove untrue,</br>Or any Water-beauty love, but you.</br>No, first the waves shall lose their biting salts,</br>The winds shall cease to sound in hollow vaults,</br>And wanton fish shall leave their native seas,</br>And bask on earth, or browze on leavy trees.", "CYMOTHOE.</br>If Glaucus will be kind, and constant prove,</br>Let us review those scenes of former love,</br>And sink embracing to th' abyss below,</br>Where spiry herbs, and lovely coral grow;</br>The ocean has its groves, and gloomy shades,</br>And crystal springs below, and cooling glades.</br>Fond you once thought that nothing here cou'd please,</br>But we have fairer meads, and taller trees</br>Than you on sun-burnt, sapless earth cou'd boast,</br>Whose fading beauties are too quickly lost.</br>The glories of their spring are soon defac'd</br>By miry storms, and tost by ev'ry blast.", "But see, the birds in noisy troops are join'd,</br>I hear the distant murmurs of the wind.</br>The vapours into dark confusion blend,</br>And will e'er long in sudden spouts descend.</br>The angry waves begin their uncouth noise,</br>And teeming clouds bring down the falling skies.</br>Hast then, my Glaucus, to those peaceful meads</br>And reedy plains, where hoary Phorcys feeds</br>His numerous herds; where neither storms nor rain</br>Molest the trees, nor incommode the swain;</br>Where unmixt waters are as crystal clear,</br>And warm as summer glooms, and fine as air.</br>A faintish light shines through the watry green,</br>And lets us see enough, but &mdash; not be seen;</br>The spangl'd glories of the plain reveals</br>With Pebbles checquer'd, and with azure shells.</br>Dive, Glaucus, swift, and let us sinking move</br>Down to the center of the world, and &mdash; Love.</br>"]
