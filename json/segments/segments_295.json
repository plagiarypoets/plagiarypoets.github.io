["Awake, fair Muse; for I intend</br>These everlasting lines to thee,</br>And, honour'd Drayton, come and lend</br>An ear to this sweet melody:</br>For on my harp's most high and silver string</br>To those Nine Sisters whom I love, I sing.", "This man through death and horror seeks</br>Honour by the victorious steel;</br>Another in unmapped creeks</br>For jewels moors his winged keel.</br>The clam'rous Bar wins some, and others bite</br>At looks thrown from a mushroom favourite.", "But I, that serve the lovely Graces,</br>Spurn at that dross which most adore;</br>And titles hate like painted faces,</br>And heart-fed care for evermore.</br>Those pleasures I disdain which are pursu'd</br>With praise and wishes by the multitude.", "The bays, which deathless Learning crowns,</br>Me of Apollo's troop installs:</br>The satyrs following o'er the downs</br>Fair nymphs to rustic festivals,</br>Make me affect (where men no traffic have)</br>The holy horror of a savage cave.", "Through the fair skies I thence intend,</br>With an unus'd and powerful wing,</br>To bear me to my journey's end:</br>And those that taste the Muses' spring,</br>Too much celestial fire have at their birth</br>To live long time like common souls in earth.", "From fair Aurora will I rear</br>Myself unto the source of floods;</br>And from the Ethiopian bear,</br>To him as white as snowy woods;</br>Nor shall I fear (from this day taking flight)</br>To be wound up in any veil of night.", "Of Death I may not fear the dart,</br>As is the use of human state;</br>For well I know my better part</br>Dreads not the hand of Time or Fate.</br>Tremble at Death, Envy, and Fortune who</br>Have but one life:  Heaven gives a poet two.", "All costly obsequies away,</br>Marble and painting too, as vain;</br>My ashes shall not meet with clay,</br>As those do of the vulgar train.</br>And if my Muse to Spenser's glory come,</br>No king shall own my verses for his tomb.</br>"]
