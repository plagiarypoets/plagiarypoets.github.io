["While his sheep play cheerful around,</br>And crop the fresh grass off the plain,</br>The notes of soft Music resound,</br>The notes of young Marcus the swain:&mdash;</br>To Eliza he tunes his sweet voice,</br>In grace and in beauty array'd,</br>The vallies responsive rejoice,</br>While silence and stillness pervade.", "On the bank of yon smooth gliding brook,</br>With aspect in sweetness serene,</br>As she gracefully lean'd on her crook,</br>The lovely Eliza I've seen:</br>While pensive the flood she survey'd,</br>Which stole in soft murmurs along,</br>Unnoticed I lay in the shade,</br>While the birds tun'd their evening song.", "Eliza!  ah, who can describe?</br>Who her beauty and charms can unfold?</br>Who can paint great Sol in his pride,</br>When he mounts his bright chariot of gold?</br>Her curling and beautiful hair</br>O'er her back hung gracefully down;</br>Like the snow her loose garments were fair&mdash;</br>There grace and simplicity's found.", "Eliza I've oft seen before,</br>Tho' nought but our eyes have yet spoke;</br>Her in silence I calmly adore,</br>For her now the Muse I invoke;</br>My bosom now points to the day,</br>When I with this maid shall be known,</br>When we'll pass the swift hours away,</br>When my passion for her I may own.", "With his tinges of beautiful hue</br>The sun is now gilding the sky,</br>All Nature is charming to view,</br>The scene draws the heart's pensive sigh:&mdash;</br>Come my sheep, return to your fold,</br>While your shepherd points the known way,</br>Who covets nor honour nor gold,</br>The crook, not the sceptre to sway.", "Thus Marcus indulg'd his soft strains,</br>While graceful reclin'd in a shade,</br>I, thoughtfully rambling the plains,</br>Directed my steps where he lay'd.</br>Congenial in sorrow and thought,</br>His musical notes struck my ear;</br>I pensive survey'd the fond spot,</br>And dropt to Eliza a tear.</br>"]
