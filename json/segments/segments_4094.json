["Ye Shepherds who make the cool grove</br>With your pipe's rural music resound,</br>Be dumb whilst I sing of my love</br>To the woodlands and vallies around.", "Still &mdash; still you intrude your fond lays,</br>Then let me reveal her dear name;</br>'Tis Eliza her Shepherd would praise,</br>Sure that your attention may claim!", "Not all the sweet blossoms of Spring,</br>Nor Summer's more gorgeous attire,</br>Not all that ripe Autumn can bring,</br>Can paint the dear Girl I admire.", "For soon shall rough Winter appear,</br>And the groves and the vallies lie waste,</br>While every gay child of the year</br>Shall perish before the cold blast.", "But tho' the rude winter of age</br>O'er the cheeks of my love may prevail,</br>Her soul must for ever engage,</br>Her sweetness for [ever?] avail.", "With a form which the Graces might wear,</br>Are the Loves and the Virtues combin'd;</br>There is witchcraft, 'tis true, in her air,</br>But 'tis weak to the charms of her mind.", "How gayly the moments would glide,</br>Tho' a cottage were all my domain,</br>If Eliza would sit by my side,</br>If Eliza would smile on her swain!", "In vain might the summer depart,</br>In vain might the winter appear,</br>If his Charmer refuse not her heart</br>Say!  what has a lover to fear?</br>"]
