["Hapless the traveller who in Country Town</br>Lights at that Inn where the Assembly's held,</br>Where all attention is thereby absorbed.</br>More hapless still, if placed beneath the room</br>Where pipe and tabor, by him partly heard,</br>Inspire with sprightly mirth the jocund youth,</br>Whose nimble feet shake the rude window-frame,</br>That lights the solitary caitiff's room.</br>There sits he musing on the joys above,</br>Not to the unknown traveller allowed,</br>Where the spruce mercer, or the lawyer's clerk,</br>Once in a month, casting all care aside,</br>Meets the fair milliner, whose dimpled cheek</br>Smiles approbation on the gentle squeeze,</br>Which, crossing over right and left, affords</br>Occasion to express:  not unobserved</br>By the grave aunt who sits on bench to spy,</br>Herself all disengaged, what passes there,</br>And at next morning's breakfast gravely reads</br>A solemn lecture, to th' unbelieving maid,</br>Of simple hearts by Man's false vows betrayed.</br>Heedless of this, so oft repeated, she</br>Enjoys the pleasant hour &mdash; and sure 'tis mirth</br>That well befits the joyous days of youth,</br>Never condemn'd but by those gloomy souls</br>That know not, or forget, they once were young.</br>"]
