["AUGUST, OR MANS YOUTH.", "When Phoebus doth with chast Astrea meete,</br>Crowning the fruits and fields with influence sweet</br>Then plants bring forth their fruits, after their kinde,</br>Not all alike, some good, some bad we finde,</br>So man in Youth shewes by his conversation,</br>His towardness, and former education,</br>Like as the fire which long hath lurkt in ashes,</br>When it gets stronger fewel, flames and flashes,</br>So nature which in weaknesse long did lurke,</br>Doth now in heate of blood begin to worke:</br>Or like strong wines  in caske, when first they vent,</br>They shew themselves in motion vehement,</br>So man in leavned age, and youthfull prime</br>Gives passions most violent for a time;</br>Tinder nor flaxe takes not with Vulcanes ire</br>More quickly, than youths bloods set on fire,</br>And oft condemnes the Stoicke apathie,</br>As by his passionate valour we may see.</br>So Pellas flower did conquer all the East,</br>Alcides kill'd the many-headed beast,</br>Jason with the noble Youths of Greece,</br>In spight of dangers wonne the golden fleece:</br>This passion as it is a whetting  stone</br>To goodnesse, so to evill it spurreth on.</br>Loves passion made Perithous descend</br>To Plutoes house t' attend his lustfull end;</br>Anger made Eteocles kill his brother,</br>Nor could their funerall smoake agree together;</br>Revenge did cause Orestes put to death</br>His mother, who did give him life and breath;</br>So griefe made Ajax turne his wrath from Troy,</br>And with the fatall sword himselfe destroy: </br>This age still in extremes can scarce obey</br>Reason, cause passion beares so great a sway,</br>And oft, when reason and affection too</br>Concurre, the danger's, not to overdoe.</br>It leadeth us unto a forked way,</br>Where the great Hercules was sayd to stay,</br>The one is broad, plumed on every side,</br>With Damaske Roses, and with Flora's pride,</br>There Ceres gifts in great aboundance grow,</br>And Bacchus cupps with nectar overflow;</br>There's downy beds stuffed with swanlike plumes,</br>There every thing is sweetned with perfumes;</br>The winged quiristers with their sweete throates,</br>Doe warble forth their care-bereaving notes;</br>And painted pleasure lyeth all along</br>Upon her downes, the fragrant flowers among,</br>Her lookes are lovely, and her eyes are cleare</br>Much like to Venus, when she did appeare</br>First from the sea; the honey's not so sweete,</br>As are her words, she's outwardly compleate,</br>But O if one should see her breast within,</br>Farre different would he finde it from her skinne.</br>Whatever she pretends she meanes no lesse</br>Than death, destruction, gall, and bitternesse;</br>Her eyes, like Basiliskes, they see and kill,</br>Her voyce like Sirens doth entise to ill;</br>Beleeve bee no wayes, when she sheddeth teares,</br>For like the Crocodiles, they're full of feares;</br>She gives Circean cuppes giddy wine,</br>Mixt with toades poyson, and the Lotish rine,</br>And turnes man into Goate, or mimicke Ape,</br>Or Wolfe, or Lyon, which doth roare and gape;</br>Oft times she with her cupps so doth them drench,</br>That without blood their thirst they cannot quench;</br>But which is worst of all behold the end,</br>To misery and death they are condemn'd.</br>A little swinish pleasure deare they buy,</br>With Gout, Consumption, or the Pleurisie,</br>And brings upon themselves such misery,</br>That they can choose, or doe nothing, but dye.</br>Perhaps one Polemo who in her waies,</br>Hath lavish'd out his young and tender dayes,</br>When he a wise Xenocrates doth heare,</br>Will be ashamed, and his garlands teare;</br>But he is one amongst a thousand, who</br>Farre otherwayes, then he hath done, will doe;</br>For vitious custome puts them so in ure,</br>As that it doth their hearts and minds obdure;</br>Their better Parts from Heav'n it doth deface,</br>And tyran-like usurpeth Natures place,</br>Then nothing profits carefull education,</br>And hope is gone of healthfull reformation.</br>O what a pitty's this!  Nature brought forth,</br>A towardnesse,which gave some hopes of worth;</br>Their mother suffred paines, and gave them sucke,</br>And dandled them with songs of happy lucke,</br>Then were they put to Schooles, and learning taught,</br>And now when tis their prime, all is for naught.", "The other is a steepe and narrow path,</br>And, beside which you make, no passage hath,</br>Its straw'd with briers, thornes all along,</br>Through which, who ere so walkes, he needes must throng;</br>On every side are monsters such as dwell</br>In Plutos prisons, and the pits of hell:</br>Here sits gray-headed, and heart killing cares,</br>Here lyes palefaced, and joynt-shaking feares;</br>Here warchfull Dragons, whose unsleepy eyes,</br>The care-relenting Morphews never sees;</br>There vaine and phreneticke labour rowles a stone</br>Like Sisyphus the craggy rocke's upon;</br>At last Despaire drooping and almost dead,</br>Scarcely can pull the rope over her head.</br>On th' other side, the furious Passions stand,</br>Marching with armes along, in traine-like band.</br>Angry with fiery eyes and frownes doth threat</br>To pull high thundring Jove downe from his seate:</br>Next comes Contention with her cursed brands</br>Seeking to set on fire both sea and lands;</br>Then Hatred in her hollow heart doth keepe</br>Revenge and for occasion forth doth peepe;</br>There Rashness, on a rope hangs by the toe,</br>And of her boldnesse makes a foolish show:</br>Vaine Hope with waxen wings doth love to flye</br>Like Icarus, above the Azure sky.</br>Fierce monsters doe this narrow passage bound,</br>And deadly dangers it encompasse round.</br>Yet Vertue doth her followers safely guide,</br>Least they should goe astray on either side.</br>Prudence through the darke windings doth them lead,</br>Safely with Ariadnes clew of thread.</br>Then Vertues ushers, Courage, Constancy,</br>Doe hearten them on against adversity:</br>And show them Vertues Castle, how on high,</br>It stands resplendent all with Majesty.</br>If they doe stumble gainst a blocke or stone,</br>Then Constancy saies, stay not here, goe on;</br>And Hope proclaimes afarre:  Loe here you shall</br>Have joy for sorrow, Hony for your gall.</br>Here peace and joyfull rest, for ever dwell</br>Which neither crosse nor time shall ever quell,</br>So when they have these hideous monsters past</br>With joy they reach the mountaines top at last.</br>Where Vertues pallace stands on pillars square</br>The courts of gold, the gates of of chrystall are,</br>And all this glorious castle's founded on</br>The Chrysolite, Saphire, and Berill stone.</br>Before the stately gates, blacke Envy lies,</br>Tormented with the aspect of her eyes;</br>On whom, when once these Champions doe trample,</br>Through Vertues Courts, they enter Honours Temple,</br>Then Glory doth eternall Trophees raise,</br>And Fame Seraphik-like, their name doth blaze.</br>There but two ways; and yet where one dare venter</br>On this, a thousand by the other enter:</br>Vertue, oft, all alone doth goe and dwell;</br>Pleasure doth lead whole colonies to hell.</br>Nay, I dare say, the most of men doe stray</br>At first, and enter in the broader way;</br>Happy are they who doe returne, before</br>They runne too deepe in cursed pleasures score,</br>Darke ignorance doth blindfold many so,</br>That from the meane into th' extremes they goe.</br>Their ship scarce from the shore her course doth take,</br>When she on deadly-rockes doth shipwracke make;</br>Others have knowledge and the best desire,</br>But crost with stormes and fortunes spightfull ire,</br>There strength and meanes answer not to their mind,</br>And so poore soules they're forst to lag behind.</br>Amongst so many thousands of this age</br>How few with faire applause goe off the stage;</br>And yet those few like Gideons fleece, we see</br>Tith'd by untimely fates mortality.</br>When fruites are almost ripe, storme can them shake,</br>When Youth is almost man, death may him take.</br>Search you deaths Lime pits, and youle finde therein,</br>As oft the Young Steeres as the Oxes skinne;</br>Oft time old gray-haird wrinkles swim in teares,</br>For youthes who dyed in their prime of yeeres;</br>The ancient Pollard Oake ofttimes doth see,</br>The overthrowing of a Young Beech tree,</br>This onely law is propper unto man,</br>To dye, or soone, or late, doe what he can.</br>One way he comes to life, if Fates dispose</br>Will once of him, a thousand wayes he goes.", "The stormy seas doe not with waves so fret,</br>When roaring surges, glowming clouds doe threat,</br>As with contrary tides my breast doth swell,</br>And doubtfull thoughts my plunged soule doth quell;</br>Which furious anger doth me headlong lead,</br>And shaking feares doe strike me almost dead;</br>While hope doth raise and sorrow downe me cast;</br>Lord after storme, shew forth thy calme at last.</br>Chase anger, feare, vaine hope and griefe away,</br>That joy and rest of soule, enjoy I may.</br>The first fruites of my young age sanctifie,</br>With strength of body, strength thy grace in me,</br>Direct me Lord along thy narrow path,</br>Which may lead me to Heaven, by saving faith,</br>Strengthen me with perseverance to the end,</br>From Satan, and Hels monsters me defend:</br>So when I shall come to Heavens rest, I'le sing,</br>O cruell death,where is thy deadly sting:</br>And when I shall triumph in Heaven with thee,</br>I'le say, O Grave, where is thy victory,</br>Before I want this rest, I had rather goe</br>Through thousand Lab'rinths of this mortall woe.</br>These worldly crosses, last but for a day,</br>And like the Eastwind, quickly flye away:</br>But sure I am when earthly sorrow's past,</br>Heav'ns thought-surpassing joy shall ever last.</br>"]
