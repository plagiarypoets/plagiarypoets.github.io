["He comes &mdash; shall my Muse wake the reed?</br>Ah, where are the notes of the bough!</br>When whilom the beech on the mead</br>Attested the Villager's vow:</br>When Philomel's pastoral lay</br>Pour'd forth her melodious pain;</br>The kids with the lambkins in play,</br>Skip'd frolicksome over the plain.", "Of visage deep wrinkled with care,</br>His temples a chaplet surround,</br>With oak-leaves and acorns his hair,</br>And star-wort and saffron is bound.</br>The damsen its purple bestows,</br>A sash o'er his shoulder to throw;</br>In negligence easy it flows,</br>Immingled with spots of the sloe.", "His right hand a scorpion suspends,</br>That, high-lifted, writhes in the air;</br>From his left, a rush basket impends,</br>Repleat with the walnut and pear;</br>His franchise it is to convoke</br>Thick fogs of blue mist on the hill,</br>Ascending like columns of smoke,</br>Exhal'd from the vale-loving rill.", "No more to the Brook must I stray,</br>From the whisp'ring valley exil'd;</br>No longer these zephyrs shall play</br>Round Delia, that linger'd and smiled;</br>When near the smooth lapse of the brook,</br>I sought thro' the whispering vale,</br>The roses, which painting her crook,</br>Compar'd to her blushes were pale.", "Farewell to the white-flaunting hop,</br>The garden so sweet to the sight;</br>The woodbine faint blooming I'll crop,</br>Convey to my fair with delight;</br>I'll gather autumnal perfume;</br>The suckle rejects not her sweet,</br>Convolvulus offers its bloom</br>To decorate Delia's retreat.", "But who is this envoy of woes,</br>That wakes with Aurora's first ray,</br>His song of complaint to disclose</br>From the vine, or the jessamine spray?</br>He sings desolations to come,</br>Stern Winter predicts from aloof;</br>My shed, social bird, be thy home,</br>Securely perch under my roof.", "Dost grieve that the Summer is past?</br>The trees their green ornaments shed?</br>The omens of Winter in haste</br>Impending press over thy head?</br>Prolong, tuneful Red-Breast, thy strains;</br>Contagions shall usher thy moan;</br>My sympathies share in thy pains,</br>Thy sorrows, poor bird, be my own!</br>"]
