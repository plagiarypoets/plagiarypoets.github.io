["Upon a bank with spreading boughs o'erhung,</br>Of pollard oak, brown elm, and hornbeam grey,</br>The faded fern and russet grass among,</br>While rude winds swept the yellow leaves away,</br>And scatter'd o'er the ground the wild fruits lay;</br>As from the churchyard came the village throng,</br>Down sat a rural bard, and rais'd his mournful song.", "\"Nature's best gifts, alas, in vain we prize!</br>The powers that please, the powers that pleasure gain!</br>For O with them, in full proportion, rise</br>The powers of giving and of feeling pain!</br>Why from my breast now bursts this plaintive strain?</br>Genius, my Friend!  with all its charms was thine,</br>And sensibility too exquisite is mine!", "\"There low he lies! &mdash; that head in dust repos'd,</br>Whose active thought scann'd every various theme!</br>Clos'd is that eye, for ever, ever clos'd,</br>Whence wont the blaze of sentiment to beam!</br>Mute is that tongue, whence flow'd the copious stream</br>Of eloquence, whose moral lore so rare</br>Delighted and improv'd the listening Young and Fair.", "\"Witness for me, ye rain-polluted rills;</br>Ye desart meads, that one brown hue display;</br>Ye rude east-winds, whose breath the dank air chills;</br>Ye hovering clouds, that veil the Sun's faint ray!</br>Witness, as annual here my steps shall stray,</br>How his dear image thought shall still recall,</br>And oft the sigh shall heave, and oft the tear shall fall!\"", "As cease the murmurs of the mantling pool,</br>As cease the whispers of the poplar spray,</br>While o'er the vale the white mist rises cool</br>At the calm sunset of a summer's day&mdash;</br>So softly, sweetly ceas'd the Shepherd's lay:</br>While down the pathway to the hamlet plain</br>Return'd, with lingering steps, the pensive rural train.</br>"]
