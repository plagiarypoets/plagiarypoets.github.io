["Bandusia's spring!  more glittering-clear than glass,</br>Thy due the mellow wine, with no scant flowers,</br>A kid at dawn is thine:</br>Whose brow, just bourgeonning</br>With firstling horns, decides for love and war</br>In vain:  the stripling of the wanton fold</br>Shall tinge with ruddy blood</br>Thy crystal, cooling rills.</br>Thee the fierce dog-star in his blazing hour</br>Despairs to touch:  thou welcomest the herd,</br>Yoke-harrass'd, and stray flock,</br>With thy voluptuous cool.</br>Thy place is with the famous streams:  for I</br>Have sung the green oak that o'ercanopies</br>Yon cave-worn rocks, whence leap</br>Thy bubbling water-falls.</br>"]
