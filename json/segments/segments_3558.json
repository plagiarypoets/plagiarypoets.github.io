["In elder times, one Poet prais'd</br>Another's lines, nor envy felt:</br>And, by that Candour, oft-times rais'd</br>A fame himself, so justly dealt:", "SPENCER prais'd many, tho' above</br>All praise himself &mdash; sweet DRAYTON too,</br>Spoke in his rhimes a Poet's love</br>For other Bards &mdash; gave each his due:", "Stern JOHNSON, tho' his praise came hard,</br>As thinking he could fame confer,</br>To BEAUMONT shew'd most dear regard,</br>And was his Muse's harbinger&mdash;", "Nay tho' 'twas thought he somewhat grudg'd</br>That fame, 'bove all great SHAKESPEAR gain'd,</br>Yet, in his praise BEN toil'd and drudg'd,</br>Nor can we think such praises feign'd!", "Why should not modern Poets, then,</br>Give to their thoughts like honest vent?</br>Why be denied &mdash; like rough old BEN,</br>To strive repay the pleasure lent!", "Thy verses HARLEY, are so sweet,</br>Thy thoughts so tender, Tales so rare;</br>Thy turns, thy points, so terse, so neat,</br>With COWPER thou may'st well compare:", "Oh!  hapless Bard!  may his sad lot</br>Ne'er be my HARLEY'S luckless fate!</br>Whether in palace or in cot,</br>Be thy life happy &mdash; thy death late!</br>"]
