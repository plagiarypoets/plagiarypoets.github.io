["Hence, sons of riot!  hence away!</br>Away who noisy mirth pursue!</br>You who to hurry give the day,</br>The muse's song is not for you!&mdash;</br>She sings to those who can disdain</br>Of power and wealth the splendid train,</br>Who love the great, the wise, the good,</br>And court the modest charms of meek-ey'd Solitude.", "Hail, Solitude!  celestial maid!</br>Mild patroness of truth and song!</br>Come in simplicity array'd,</br>And let us fly the busy throng!</br>Yon sweet, sequester'd woodbine bower,</br>By Nature gemm'd with every flower,</br>Close by the crystal murmuring stream,</br>Embrac'd by woods, will shield us from the noon-tide beam.", "Come, lovely subject of my song,</br>With friendship come, whose tender glow,</br>Thy consecrated bowers among,</br>Will balm afford for every woe!</br>We'll range the fruitful fields below,</br>Bask on the mountain's sunny brow,</br>Love the wild music of the shade,</br>The hum of mountain bees, the flower that decks the glade.", "Lo!  the indulgent Goddess hears,</br>She comes, and listens to my strain!</br>She comes, and folly disappears,</br>And folly's light fantastic train.</br>Pride, pomp, and grandeur haste away,</br>Deceit and envy dare not stay,</br>Vice, cruelty, and murder fly,</br>Fly the mild radiance of her heavenly-beaming eye.", "Here, heaven rapt meditation's glow,</br>Truth's steady step and piercing eye,</br>And wisdom's calm majestic brow,</br>The world's bewitching smiles defy!</br>Philosophy, heaven's darling child,</br>And modest virtue walk the wild;</br>Sweet poesy attunes her lays,</br>And with creative eye all nature's charms surveys.", "Oft, revelry!  I've left thy bowers,</br>To muse, with wisdom's pensive eye,</br>O'er yon lone abbey's mouldering towers,</br>Where low the fair and mighty lie!</br>O'er its fall'n walls the cypress pale</br>Sighs mournful to the hollow gale;</br>There, to eternity's dread shore,</br>Nature directs the eye, and teaches man her lore!", "From hoary cliffs, here, woods depend,</br>And shade the stream that glides below!</br>Hoarse, murmuring notes the turtles send,</br>Responsive to each other's woe.</br>The birds harmonious numbers sing,</br>The music floats on zephyr's wing;</br>And white-rob'd innocence and love</br>Sweet Solitude invoke, and court the peaceful grove.", "When evening shuts the eye of day,</br>And soft repose o'er Nature steals,</br>The pale moon rising on her way</br>Gleams faintly o'er the eastern hills;</br>Then melancholy heaves the sigh,</br>Slow falls the tear from sorrow's eye;</br>Lone Philomella echo wakes,</br>And sad in night's dull ear her amorous moan she makes.", "When from the busy world I fly</br>False friends avoid the sacred ground;</br>Ambition's towers in ruins lie,</br>Nor flattery's smile has power to wound;</br>Strength cannot hurt, nor art prepare</br>For simple innocence a snare;</br>Nor pride can draw my heart astray</br>From virtue's heaven-ward path to vice's dangerous way.", "Teach me, O Solitude!  to know</br>Myself, mankind, life's little span,</br>Regarding all events below</br>As part of Heaven's stupendous plan.</br>To trust in Heaven's protecting care,</br>To cherish virtue, charming fair!</br>T' enjoy young pleasure's smiling train,</br>Or welcome Sorrow, and the pale-ey'd race of pain!", "Would Heaven my glowing wishes crown,&mdash;</br>Where Tweed's clear waters wind along&mdash;</br>Sweet Solitude!  I'd be thine own,</br>And artless raise the rural song!</br>My soul on native wings would tower</br>Above the toys of pomp and power,</br>'Till death should close this scene of woe,</br>And lead me to the realms where joys eternal flow!</br>"]
