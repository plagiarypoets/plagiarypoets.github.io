["Palemon, seated by his fav'rite Maid,</br>The Sylvan Scenes with Extasy survey'd:</br>Nothing could make the fond Alexis gay,</br>For Daphne had been absent half the Day;</br>Dar'd by Palemon for a Pastoral Prize,</br>Reluctant (in his Turn) Alexis tries.", "PALEMON.</br>This Breeze by the River how charming and soft!</br>How smooth the Grass Carpet!  how green!</br>Sweet, sweet sings the Lark! &mdash; as he carrols aloft,</br>His Music enlivens the Scene.</br>A thousand fresh Flowrets, unusually gay,</br>The Fields and the Forests adorn;</br>I pluck'd me some Roses &mdash; the Children of May!</br>And could not find one with a Thorn.", "ALEXIS.</br>The Skies are quite clouded &mdash; too bold is the Breeze!</br>Dull Vapours descend on the Plain;</br>The Verdure's all blasted that cover'd yon Trees,</br>The Birds cannot compass a Strain!</br>In Search for a Chaplet my Temples to bind,</br>All Day as I silently rove,</br>I can't find a Flowret, not one, to my Mind,</br>In Meadow, in Garden, or Grove.", "PALEMON.</br>I ne'er saw the Hedge in such excellent Bloom,</br>The Lambkins more wantonly gay!</br>My Cows seem to breathe a more pleasing Perfume,</br>And brighter than common the Day!</br>If any dull Shepherd should foolishly ask,</br>So Rich why the Landscapes appear?</br>To give a right Answer, how easy my Task!</br>Because my sweet Phillida's here.", "ALEXIS.</br>The Stream that so muddy moves slowly along,</br>Once roll'd in a beautiful Tide;</br>It seem'd o'er the Pebbles to murmur a Song,</br>But Daphne sat then by my Side:</br>See &mdash; see &mdash; the sweet Maid, o'er the Meadow she hies!</br>Quite alter'd already the Scene!</br>How limpid the Stream is! &mdash; how gay the blue Skies!</br>The Hills and the Hedges how green!</br>"]
