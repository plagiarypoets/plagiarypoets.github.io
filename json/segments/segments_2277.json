["Beside a stream, and 'neath a shade repos'd,</br>A form accoutred in a vestment rare,</br>High curv'd his arching brow, his eyes were clos'd</br>In sleep, which seem'd unruffled with a care;</br>Ah!  who could gaze upon his features then,</br>And deem them his &mdash; the Outlaw of the glen,</br>He of the blood-stain'd hand, unknown to spare&mdash;</br>But that his fire arms, and his belted blade,</br>And cold dank bed, confess'd his ruthless trade.", "He slept, he dream'd, for in repose he smiled,</br>Fancy seem'd ranging 'midst the scenes of youth,</br>Ere he for crime was from his home exil'd,</br>(That dear abode of innocence and truth)</br>Or sought by lawless enterprise to live,</br>Happy with all his humble home could give,</br>His heart embued with tenderness and truth:</br>Thus fancy ranging back with boundless scope,</br>Tinted his cheek with the bright hues of hope.", "Alas!  that youth should from such happy sleep,</br>To scenes of rapine, and to bloodshed wake;</br>Long did the night breeze low-ton'd breathings keep,</br>Nor did the slightest branch of willow shake;</br>But a change came &mdash; dark clouds pass'd o'er the moon</br>With hurrying sweep, and a wild blast rose soon;&mdash;</br>And chill'd, the dreaming youth did sleep forsake,</br>And suddenly arous'd, gaz'd wildly round</br>For scenes of bliss &mdash; alas!  no longer found.", "Those scenes were fled, yet left a record strong</br>Upon his mind, of years so fair, so bland,</br>That he in waking, could not think of wrong,</br>And smiling, gaz'd upon his blood-stain'd hand,</br>Unconscious how 'twas red, &mdash; till the loud clang</br>Of pistol shots, from the deep ravine rang,</br>And thrice the bugle sounded a command:</br>He faulteringly obey'd &mdash; his heart was still</br>Amidst far dearer views of mountain, grove, and hill.</br>"]
