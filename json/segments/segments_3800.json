["Young Colin, the pride of the plains,</br>As blithesome and blooming as May,</br>Lay breathing his soul in soft strains,</br>To Phebe the lovely and gay.", "He told her the innocent tale,</br>Of lovers whose case was his own;</br>With smiles which so often prevail</br>On hearts that are obdurate grown.", "But, alas!  how regardless she stood!</br>Nor favour'd the swain with a look:</br>But lavish'd her charms on the flood,</br>That murmuring ran down the brook.", "At length she return'd to her cot,</br>Well pleas'd with the conquest she'd made:</br>And pausing, Ah!  should she or not,</br>A sigh her fond bosom betray'd.", "The swain his addresses renew'd,</br>And Phebe then granted a smile,</br>With rapture the nymph he pursu'd,</br>Till Hymen rewarded his toils.</br>"]
