["Why heaves my fond bosom with sighs,</br>Which I anxiously wish to conceal?</br>And why do my tale-telling eyes,</br>The cause of my sorrow reveal?", "Why cannot I gladly enjoy,</br>The pleasures that daily invite?</br>And why do the pastimes now cloy,</br>Which once were my greatest delight?", "My flute was once sweet to my ear,</br>When breathing the soft swelling strain;</br>Its notes now no longer can cheer,</br>They serve but to cherish my pain?", "What pleasure my fond heart did feel,</br>When with ANNA I join'd in the dance?</br>What transports my eyes did reveal,</br>When her's met my heart-speaking glance?", "What exquisite raptures o'erpour'd,</br>My love-stricken heart when we stray'd,</br>From the sun's piercing rays 'till imbower'd,</br>In the grove we enjoy'd the cool shade!", "When she sung!  her sweet notes of accord,</br>To my heart thrill'd so pensively sweet,</br>What music her voice did afford!</br>Methought I could fall at her feet.", "Why seems the green wood and the grove,</br>Where music and melody reign,</br>To look sad &mdash; and the warblers now rove,</br>From the trees to the sweet scented plain.", "'Tis the absence of ANNA they mourn,</br>They sing not their notes with true glee,</br>Then haste, my dear ANNA, return,</br>And cheer the sad songsters and ME.</br>"]
