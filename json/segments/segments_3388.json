["When bellowing warfare lords it round,</br>And death and loud uproar abound,</br>When Gallia, wild ambitious foe,</br>Oh!  Britain aims thy overthrow;</br>When proud Iberia drains each mine,</br>Big with the same accurst design;</br>When Belgia's bold rapacious knaves</br>Have basely join'd th' aspiring slaves,</br>And foul rebellion, with averted eyes,</br>Rejects the offer'd terms, and all thy pow'r defies,", "When thus with foes encircled round,</br>And not a friendly pow'r is found;</br>Is this a time, Oh Britons say,</br>On Pleasure's lap to die away?</br>Is this a time for long debate,</br>For narrow views, and factious heat?</br>Is this a time for calm repose,</br>When half the warring world are foes?</br>Oh!  Britons rouse to patriotic deeds,</br>For oh!  oppress'd with numbers, see your country bleeds.", "Where is that glowing ardent zeal,</br>That spirit Britons wont to feel?</br>Where are your bold exertions gone,</br>And where the public virtue flown?</br>Heavens!  how alter'd, how supine,</br>How slow t' embrace each great design,</br>How worthless pride and coward fears,</br>Keep thin your corps of Volunteers;</br>But languish Britons, view to your disgrace,</br>What animation marks Hibernia's manly race.", "When danger shew'd her frightful mien,</br>No impotent attempts were seen.</br>No frigid meeting stain'd their land,</br>They rose a bold, a patriot band:</br>No narrow views, no dastard fear,</br>No supercilious pride was there,</br>All ranks, all parties feel the flame,</br>And glow at Freedom's sacred name;</br>All, all self-arm'd and self-array'd appear,</br>And at the artist's side is seen the noble Peer.", "'Twas thus they rose, and thus they stand,</br>The guardians of a rising land,</br>Disdaining ease, respected, fear'd,</br>And with a nation's plaudits cheer'd;</br>Oh!  that Britannia's sons would rise,</br>Like them intrepid, bold, and wise,</br>Like them deserve the patriot name,</br>And rise from apathy to flame&mdash;</br>Ambition soon wou'd give the contest o'er,</br>And soon wou'd meek-ey'd peace be wafted to our shore.", "Tho' baleful anger spreads around,</br>Yet sparks of virtue still are found,</br>SUFFOLK, whose sons shall live in fame,</br>And thee, Oh!  LOWTHER, thee, whose name</br>Can never die, whose noble mind</br>High-soaring, tow'rs above thy kind.</br>Oh!  Britons, join this godlike man,</br>Swift, swift, adopt his patriotic plan,</br>Your country then may raise her awful form,</br>And with unequal fury hurl the warring storm.", "Each envious state wou'd loath the sight,</br>And curse a flame so wond'rous bright;</br>Ambition, with desponding mien,</br>And nerveless arm would then be seen;</br>Despair wou'd sit on Treachery's face,</br>And Craft, dismay'd, would point at Peace;</br>Ingratitude wou'd drop her crest,</br>And fold a parent to her breast,</br>And Albion then invincible wou'd stand,</br>Ride o'er the boist'rous surge, or wave the olive wand.", "Then Britons rouse, your strength combine,</br>And baffle every fell design:</br>Oh!  emulate your sires of old,</br>Whom pride or danger ne'er controul'd,</br>Rouse, and defend this spot of earth,</br>This sea-girt isle that gave you birth,</br>Let every arm prepare the blow;</br>Then, like a wounded lion robb'd of prey,</br>Wou'd Britain strike her foes with terror and dismay.</br>"]
