["Otway had never starved in such a clime:</br>The peasants would have crowned him; their quick eyes'</br>Intelligent purpose, mellow voices' chime</br>Have drunk the beaming brightness of their skies;</br>Thus, beauty never there neglected lies:</br>The swift perception of what exquisite grows,&mdash;</br>The variegated woof which nature dies</br>With myriad colours; or the thought which flows</br>Through the worn poet's breast, reflected in them, glows.</br>"]
