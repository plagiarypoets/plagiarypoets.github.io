["Swells not with indignation ev'ry vein,</br>When parts and Churchill pour the manly strain?</br>Affecting Freedom, slave to Faction's band,</br>He points his bitterest thoughts at her command;</br>Makes murth'rous lies in proudest numbers shine,</br>\"Whilst Reputation bleeds in ev'ry line.\"</br>(O!  dire disgrace to great Apollo's court!)</br>Shews fire and swords, to please, in wanton sport.</br>How great a genius is by Faction stain'd!</br>And like Andromeda to rocks is chain'd!</br>With pow'rs to tear the wreath from Dryden's brow,</br>Make Butler laugh, and Pope submissive bow;</br>Whilst gentle Spencer gently waves his hand,</br>To point the beauties of the Fairy Land:</br>Pow'rs that can lead at will th' Aonian throng,</br>And awe the Earth with majesty of song.</br>O!  that such pow'rs, as dare the highest height,</br>Shou'd rake the kennels, and lick Tyburn's feet!</br>And even there, (so god-like is his skill,)</br>(For fallen angels are immortal still)</br>He calls forth flow'rs, as from Arabia's trees,</br>Makes carrion sweet, and villains gibbets please.</br>"]
