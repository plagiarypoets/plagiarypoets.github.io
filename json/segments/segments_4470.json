["While the lass of my heart did remain,</br>Still constant and faithful to me;</br>From sorrow, from envy and pain,</br>My breast was entirely free.</br>But now that she's fled from my arms,</br>And gone &mdash; gone for ever away!</br>My rival has bliss with her charms;</br>She's left me to weep night and day.", "My heart swells with rancour and spleen,</br>To him that has won o'er her love;</br>And whilst other's dance o'er the green,</br>I sullenly stalk through the grove.</br>From eve to the blush of the dawn,</br>I'm restless, I weep and I moan;</br>Then rise and stray over the lawn,</br>Unheeded &mdash; unpitied &mdash; along.", "They tell me variety's charms,</br>Can banish or lessen the pain;</br>We feel when we're forc'd from the arms,</br>Of those whom we love but in vain.</br>But ah!  'tis all folly to say,</br>When love once takes root in the breast,</br>And is cross'd, that by night or by day;</br>We can ever find comfort or rest.</br>"]
