["Ah!  I see, beneath yon Abbey wall,</br>Where thick the mantling ivy grows,</br>Crown'd by wide  yew and cypress tall,</br>Which shade the stream that mournful flows;", "There, prone on the bare, joyless bank,</br>A sullen spectre listless lies:</br>Nor heeds bleak winds, nor vapours dark,</br>But earth, and air, and Heav'n defies.", "In tatter'd garb this fiend appears,</br>With felon cordage firmly bound;</br>And in the bandage vile he wears</br>Pistole and sheathless blades hung round.", "One wither'd hand a cup sustains,</br>Drugg'd to the brim with liquid fire;</br>That spreads like lightning thro' the veins,</br>And instant makes the wretch expire.", "The other grasps beneath his vest</br>A dagger of envenom'd steel;</br>Whose slightest touch might pierce the breast,</br>Whose slightest wound no art might heal.", "Around his blood-stain'd eye-balls glare,</br>Each wildly bent to quit its sphere;</br>Nor will the ardent orbits bear</br>The moisture of a single tear.", "Now upward would the monster scowl,</br>But that each dark impending brow,</br>Still spreading as the loud winds howl,</br>Confines the impious sight below!", "O shield me, Heav'n! &mdash; What means that light</br>Which pours such radiance o'er the stream?</br>&mdash;It is Religion's banner bright;</br>The fiend is vanish'd &mdash; like a dream.</br>"]
