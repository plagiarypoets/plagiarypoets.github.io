["Blest Bard!  to whom the Muses, grateful, gave</br>That pipe which erst their dearest Spenser won,</br>As once they found thee, pensive and alone,</br>Strewing sweet flowers upon his hallow'd grave;</br>Then had thy fancy glow with sacred fire,</br>And softest airs thy rural verse inspire.", "Again the elfin Faies and Sylphids come,</br>At dusky eve, or in the moon-light pale,</br>To the accustom'd mead, or shadowy dale,</br>Or where the wild wood sheds a browner gloom,</br>Where oft, unseen, they listen'd to the lay</br>Of their loved Colin-clout, till peep of day.", "Once more they listen, while with mimic hand</br>Thou tun'st his rustic reed; and oft their feet,</br>Charm'd by thy simple verse and music sweet,</br>Forget the dance, and all in silence stand;</br>They hush the breeze, and chide the brook to peace,</br>And Philomel is mute till Damon cease.", "But most thy strains my raptur'd spirits raise,</br>When love of virtue prompts thy tuneful tongue;</br>When Richardson's lov'd name adorns thy song,</br>What honest heart but echoes back thy praise!</br>Sing on, sweet bard!  prolong the darling theme!</br>Hush'd be the breeze!  and mute the babbling stream!", "Fain would I, shepherd, catch the pleasing note,</br>And vainly try to learn thy wond'rous skill;</br>So the young linnet, when with varied trill</br>The Woodlark shakes his wildly-warbling throat,</br>Delighted, flutters quick her trembling wing,</br>Tries her weak voice, and twitt'ring, aims to sing.</br>"]
