["O shepherds, how sweet are the bow'rs,</br>That rise on the verse of yon grove!</br>I wove there a garland of flow'rs,</br>To give to the nymph whom I love.", "In native attractions array'd,</br>Till Nature decay she will reign;</br>Her praises be sung by each maid,</br>And ENVY will flout her in vain.", "Her air has the magic of ease,</br>Her manners are artless and free;</br>Her voice is as soft as the breeze</br>That stirs the green leaf on the tree.", "Long, long on the plains has she smil'd</br>With sweetness, untaught to deceive;</br>The light of her eye is as mild</br>As the sun-beam, when mellow'd at eve!", "Oft on some soft bank she reposes,</br>To catch all the sweets of the gale;</br>Her garlands are made of the roses,</br>That bloom in the grove or the vale.", "Her breast, that is always at ease,</br>The wild notes of Nature approves,</br>The streamlet that plains to the breeze,</br>And the music that comes from the groves.", "Her songs to the Shepherds can give</br>A sweetness that softens the breast;</br>Can bid brightest images live</br>In the bosom that SORROW has prest.", "This Damsel (the theme of my praise),</br>Who steals from the notice of Fame,</br>In vallies and woodlands oft strays&mdash;</br>SIMPLICITY there is her name.</br>"]
