["How sweet are the strains of the Muse</br>Which Nature and Fancy inspire!</br>Her strains which so softly diffuse</br>Thro' the bosom each gentle desire!", "To thee all the merit belongs;</br>The nymphs, in the jessamine bower,</br>With rapture repeat thy soft songs,</br>And the shepherd confesses their power.", "But not to thy numbers alone,</br>Thy merit, dear youth, we confine,</br>For our praises would still be thy own,</br>For thy noble, thy godlike design.", "In summer we've oft seen the plain</br>Burnt up by the sun's pow'rful ray,</br>But a show'r will revive it again,</br>And make every object look gay.", "And as the soft show'r chears the field,</br>Which without it had soon been laid waste,</br>So thy soft-flowing numbers will yield</br>Relief to the sick and distrest.", "Pale Sorrow no longer shall mourn,</br>The wounded shall rise from his bed,</br>And the widows and orphans forlorn,</br>Shall weave a fair wreathe for thy head.", "The gods shall thy labours reward,</br>Thy country to praise thee shall join,</br>And tho' my esteem and regard</br>Are trifles, dear shepherd, they're thine.</br>"]
