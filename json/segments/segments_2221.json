["As late, where BRITAIN rears her tow'ring head,</br>With blood-stain'd arms and warlike trophies crown'd,</br>The Genius of the isle his warriors led,</br>Their brows with roses and with laurel bound,</br>From his high throne he saw his nobles stand,</br>And shook War's dreadful trump, grasp'd firm within his hand.", "Quick flash'd the light'ning of his flaming spear,</br>Deep ting'd with gore on CRESSEY'S purple field;</br>He wheel'd the blazing faulchion in the air,</br>And o'er his shoulders spread the sable shield;</br>Then, as around he cast his sanguine eyes,</br>His kindling fury rose and shook the low'ring skies:", "For there, O blot on BRITAIN'S godlike name!</br>Immers'd in bliss, he saw its sons of peace</br>Contemn the glories of immortal fame,</br>And sink the slaves of luxury and ease.</br>In mimic shapes he saw his nobles move,</br>And softly murmur through the melting strains of love.", "The doubling drum no more resounds; no more</br>The brazen trumpet pours its thund'ring strain;</br>No faulchions blush with streams of foreign gore;</br>No heroes sigh to sweep the embattl'd plain:</br>By nerveless pleasure lull'd, they sing supine,</br>With truncheon'd warriors court THALIA'S comic shrine.", "The warlike mien, inform'd with glorious rage,</br>Yields to the smile which softer charms disclose;</br>The sword resign'd, each champion treads the stage,</br>And sighs and murmurs through the fancied groves:</br>While music pours for soft melodious lay,</br>The prompting Duke, enraptur'd!  pants, and dies away.", "O glorious scene!  O noble thirst of fame!</br>Who would not strut his hour upon the stage?</br>Where Lords and Dukes the envied palm obtain,</br>And stand the scourgers of a venal age:</br>Where plans are drawn, to save a threaten'd land,</br>Behind the latent scenes, by such a nerveless hand!", "Soon as the Genius cast his eyes below,</br>Burst from his soul the sympathetic sigh;</br>Sudden the tears of anguish seem to flow,</br>And feed the rage of his impassion'd eye.</br>He shook the streaming glories from his head,</br>And thus inflam'd with godlike indignation, said:", "\"Where now are all the Patriots that I knew,</br>The godlike chiefs, the hardy sons of yore;</br>Hands that I taught whole nations to subdue,</br>To plant new laurels on my fav'rite shore?</br>Where blooms their offspring, where each godlike name?</br>Not here, where impious folly dulls the crown of Fame.", "\"Ah!  what avails that CHATHAM blest this scene,</br>That once I mark'd his flow'r-encircl'd head,</br>Dwelt on the grace of his celestial mien,</br>And saw whole nations croud beneath his shade?</br>While from his lips they heard the words of fate,</br>Enthron'd upon his brow majestic Wisdom sate!", "\"Ah!  what avails that MARLBRO' once arose,</br>Wrapp'd in the burnish'd folds of warlike state;</br>Swept o'er the world, and, midst presumptuous foes,</br>Plung'd the destructive thunderbolts of fate;</br>When heirs to folly dare their titles claim,</br>And blast their blooming honours with eternal shame.\"", "He paus'd and sigh'd; then, with a withering frown,</br>Beam'd forth destructive vengeance from his eyes;</br>\"He threw the blood-stain'd sword in thunder down,</br>And swept along the fire-emblazon'd skies,</br>To where great RODNEY, wrapt in virtuous shame,</br>And noble ELLIOT, crown'd with wreaths of glory, came.\"", "Here stopt the vision, and, with bounteous look,</br>Gaz'd on the triumphs of each godlike soul;</br>Then from his side the trump of glory took,</br>And rais'd a blast that echo'd to the pole.</br>Twice round their brows his brandish'd launce he spread,</br>While radiant crowns infold each mighty warrior's head.", "Then, turning round, he shook the blazing shield,</br>And said, \"Immortal HARRINGTON!  arise;</br>'Tis thine to sweep the blood-empurpled field,</br>And reap the glories of indulgent skies,</br>'Tis thine to lead, the unconquer'd phalanx form,</br>Sweep worlds before your arms, and pour the embattled storm!", "\"See!  stars directing, point the glorious way;</br>See!  future battles rise in prospect round,</br>Hark!  glory calls; haste, HARRINGTON!  away,</br>While war, denouncing vengeance, glares around.</br>The sword on each rough peasant's thigh be worn,</br>And war's green wreaths the shepherd's manly front adorn.\"", "The Vision spake, then roll'd his orbed eyes,</br>Clash'd his dread arms, that light'ned on the plain;</br>Fierce Vengeance led his charriot through the skies,</br>And Justice, Peace, and Glory, clos'd his train.</br>Before their steps the clouds obedient yield,</br>And stars of op'ning glory light th' etherial field!</br>"]
