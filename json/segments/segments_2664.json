["'Tis now the pensive hour of early night!</br>The moon-beam glistens on the passing wave!</br>Around the bat revolves his whirling flight;</br>And watch-words hoarsely break a silence of the grave.", "Save where in feeble gusts the hollow wind</br>Bears to the heart the seaman's hollow cry!</br>And hark!  (sweet music to the wistful mind!)</br>The distant plaintive chimes in solemn pauses die.", "Hapless the day, when fraught with cruel speed</br>Relentless fate the warrior's eyelids clos'd!</br>Unknown, unwail'd he fell; and doom'd to bleed,</br>Far from the shores belov'd, where every wish repos'd;", "Far from that widow'd bed, where dreams of fright</br>Embittered joys, that hope presented still:</br>Far from those eyes, that wak'd so oft at night,</br>Dim with a fervent tear, that wept some presag'd ill.", "Here first at early morn, with jocund air,</br>His smile contagious soften'd every pain:</br>His lightsome whistle banish'd peevish care</br>And spoke the merry heart, and well-contented swain.", "The iron load of toil on him was light,</br>And laughing stars did at his birth preside;</br>He mock'd the terrors of destructive fight,</br>And bless'd the glorious day, when first his zeal was tried.", "Whether by duty call'd he trod the waste,</br>Where the dread thunder of the mortar flies;</br>Or, speeding homewards with paternal haste</br>The busy crowded hearth illum'd the parent's eye.", "Tranquil his soul. &mdash; At night the busy hum</br>Of garbling infants stunn'd the cricket's song:</br>Some on his knee he toss'd; while proudly some</br>Strutted the house, with sword and bayonet along.", "Again the wonted tale of former days</br>Fix'd the fond ear of his complacent wife;</br>As still she heard, thro' many a wordy maze,</br>The thousand hair-breadth hazards of her husband's life.", "She fear'd not yet the luckless cast of fate,</br>Nor dream'd of future grief and helpless need:</br>She heard him many a comrade's death relate</br>But little thought she then, his own so soon decreed.", "On foreign plains he lies!  the wint'ry wind</br>Wails through the thorn o'er his sepulchral sod;&mdash;</br>His bones these arms in their lone cell confin'd:</br>With patriot's spirits flown, his soul awaits her God!</br>"]
