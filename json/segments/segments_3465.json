["O impious man!  from av'rice blind,</br>Blind to the sacred light of truth,</br>Not to discern the lineal mind,</br>The lineal features in the youth.</br>Can noble things from base proceed?&mdash;</br>Not so the lion springs, not so the steed;</br>Nor from the vulgar tenants of the grove,</br>Sublimed with pageant-fire, the strong-pounced bird of Jove.</br>"]
