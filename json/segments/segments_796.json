["How swift, alas!  the rolling years</br>Haste to devour their destin'd prey,</br>A moth each winged minute bears,</br>Which still in vain the stationers</br>From the dead authors, sweep away,</br>And troops of canker worms with secret pride,</br>Thro' gay vermillion leaves, and gilded covers glide.", "Great B&mdash;nt&mdash;y!  should thy critic vein</br>Each day supply the teaming press,</br>Of ink should'st thou whole rivers drain,</br>Not one octavo should remain,</br>To shew thy learning and address.</br>Oblivion drags them to her silent cell,</br>Where great king Arthur and his nobles dwell.", "Authors of every size and name,</br>Knights, squires, and doctors of all colours,</br>From the pursuit of lasting fame,</br>Retiring there a mansion claim;</br>Behold the fate of modern scholars!</br>Why will you then with hopes delusive led,</br>For various readings toil which never will be read.", "With silver clasp, and corner plate,</br>You fortify the favourite book,</br>Fear not from worms, nor time your fate,</br>More cruel foes your works await,</br>The butler, with th' impatient cook,</br>And pastry nymphs with trunk-makers combine</br>To ease the groaning shelves, and spoil the fair design.</br>"]
