["At the vernal approach of the year,</br>The birds they delightfully sing;</br>Nature's flow'rets in graces appear,</br>And the grottoes with melody ring:</br>The swain of all cares unpossest,</br>Views his flocks on their verdant abode;</br>As he views he seems happily blest,</br>No cares can his peace incommode.", "He rises at dawn of the day,</br>And carelessly trudges along;</br>To drive dissipation away,</br>He whistles, or muses a song:</br>With joy he his Phillis beholds,</br>Unaccustom'd to rancour or spite;</br>To the plains he his feeling unfolds,</br>In raptures of rural delight.", "The emblem of innocent love,</br>The lambkin alertly displays;</br>Concordant their murmurs they move,</br>To nature addresses of praise:</br>With gayness their pastimes combine,</br>By the fountains their gambols they play;</br>Co-mutual their pleasures conjoin,</br>Sweet pleasures, that brook no allay.", "Mankind in expectance pursue</br>The bubbles of honor and fame,</br>And eagerly seek to renew,</br>The shadowy boasts of a name;</br>Whilst the shepherds and swains of the grove,</br>In contentment and happiness reign;</br>Exempt from all passions &mdash; but love,</br>And nothing their joys to restrain.</br>"]
