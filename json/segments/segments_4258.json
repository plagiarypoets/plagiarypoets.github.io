["To the woods and the groves I'll complain,</br>I'll sing to the echo alone,</br>For mankind but sport with my pain,</br>And laugh at my amorous moan:</br>But no peace can their jeerings impart,</br>Nor their laughter my sorrows remove,</br>&mdash;Ah me!  how contracted the heart,</br>Till refin'd and expanded by love!", "No swain was more jocund than I,</br>To mirth I devoted the day;</br>But now to the breezes I sigh,</br>And breathe out my sorrowful lay:</br>How sad and how lonely the scene!</br>What a change has the grove undergone!</br>No joys can I find on the green,</br>For, alas!  my FLORELLA is gone!", "She's gone &mdash; ah, there's death in the sound!</br>She's gone &mdash; and her absence I mourn:</br>I will dig me a cave in the ground,</br>I will weep till FLORELLA return.</br>O ye linnets, give over your lay,</br>And abroad let the nightingale stroll,</br>With the stock-dove I'll groan thro' the day,</br>And at night I'll lament with the owl.", "A chaplet of willow I'll twine,</br>(Meet garb for the shepherd that mourns,)</br>But in trappings more gaudy I'll shine,</br>When my faithful FLORELLA returns:</br>Then haste, lovely maid!  to the grove,</br>And thy swain from his cloister release;</br>One glance all his pains will remove,</br>One smile will recover his ease.</br>"]
