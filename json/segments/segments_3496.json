["All-pow'rful Love then gently touch'd the lyre,</br>The throbbing bosom felt the kindling fire;</br>And whilst the pleasing pain</br>Ran quick through ev'ry vein,</br>How did each beating pulse proclaim</br>His influence o'er the human frame!</br>His harmony imprest</br>Upon the feeling breast</br>A joy which love, and love alone, can e'er inspire.", "From the soft flute he breath'd so sweet a strain,</br>Gladness diffused a smile o'er all the chearful plain;</br>Responsive echo lengthen'd ev'ry note,</br>And on the playful breeze did heav'nly music float.</br>Such the sensations he did now impart,</br>That ev'ry plaintive murmur reach'd the heart.", "The latent flame, erst carefully conceal'd,</br>Each tender maid reveal'd;</br>The little birds on ev'ry waving spray</br>Resistless pow'r obey:</br>The sportive lambkins frolick round,</br>And frisk it o'er th' enamel'd ground.</br>His sounds melodious charm'd th' attentive throng,</br>All nature listen'd and approv'd the song.</br>"]
