["When fam'd Eliza reign'd, a SPENCER liv'd;</br>Whose fame almost his Mistress's surviv'd:</br>And on Great William's glorious acts attends,</br>One, whom each man, each country too commends;</br>Fam'd ADDISON, whose worth to all is known,</br>And by fame's trumpet round the world is blown.</br>Shall our great Monarch then a Poet want?</br>And is the English Genius grown so scant?</br>"]
