["\"Hail, INDOLENCE,\" meek power, whose placid birth</br>Was celebrated in the sacred East,</br>By the hoar BRAMIN'S flame,</br>Fann'd by thy MOTHER'S breath.", "Thee, the proud LORD of DAY'S creative heat,</br>As he in fainting rapture on the breast</br>Of the WEST WIND reclin'd,</br>Gave to the early World:", "The whiles around thy cradle spicy gales</br>Breath'd aromatic odours, and refresh'd</br>Thy infant sense; delight</br>Beyond the hope of toil.", "Benign Restorer of the World, though there</br>Thy dearest haunts remain'd, and gentle EASE,</br>Thy sister, spread her arms,</br>For thy perpetual couch:", "Yet mindful of mankind, thy darling care,</br>Stole to the shiv'ring native of the NORTH,</br>And lull'd him to the roar</br>Of the rude Winter's song.", "NECESSITY, thy foe, stood charm'd awhile,</br>Nor so imperiously his daily task</br>Enjoin'd incessant, but</br>Permitted his repose.", "Soon GENIUS cheer'd his darkness with her lamp,</br>And SCIENCE with far-reaching arms, procur'd</br>His comforts from the waste,</br>That frown'd on him before.", "'Twas INDOLENCE inspir'd the Muses gifts;</br>And bade their wild notes murmur from his cave,</br>In song thus haply free,</br>Unfetter'd ev'n by rhyme.</br>"]
