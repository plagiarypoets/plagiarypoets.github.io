["Hither, all ye Loves and Graces,</br>Hither with your smiling faces;</br>Frolic Mirth with aspect wild,</br>(Sweet Good-humour's lovely child)</br>Come and make the scene more gay,</br>Welcome in the sprightly May.", "Hence, ah!  Melancholy hence,</br>Nor thy baleful gloom dispense;</br>But hither haste ye jocund train,</br>Assemble on the verdant plain;</br>Come and chaunt a rural lay,</br>Welcome to the sprightly May.", "Thalia come, thou laughing muse,</br>And thy gaiety diffuse;</br>Come, and with thy comic face,</br>Fill with pleasure every place;</br>Leave Parnassus for this day,</br>Welcome in the sprightly May.", "Nymphs and swains, ye merry throng,</br>Charm the ear with rustic song;</br>Let music echo thro' the grove,</br>Softest notes of peace and love,</br>While the warblers on each spray,</br>Join the welcome to the May.</br>"]
