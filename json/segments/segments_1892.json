["There is a charm in friendship's sacred flame,</br>A soft endearment in its pleasing smiles,</br>That shoots extatic feeling through the frame,</br>And makes this earth a heaven.  It beguiles</br>The frowns of fate, and life's annoying broils;</br>Bedecks our chequer'd path with fragrant flowers;</br>Plays, like a sun-beam, on our many toils;</br>Gives brighter shades to bliss; wings the dull hours;</br>Dispels the cloud of sorrow when it threat'ning low'rs.", "These were the gifts your friendship made to me,</br>Th' ingenuous tribute of your faithful heart.</br>These did I dream mine 'till eternity&mdash;</br>But, like a dream they're vanish'd, and I part</br>Divided, &mdash; torn with many a madd'ning smart,</br>From **** shores where first our friendship grew.</br>Perhaps, when absent, you may yet impart</br>One kind remembrance, though ne'er more to view</br>Him in whose breast a heart beat, and will beat for you.", "Receive than here, a long &mdash; my last farewell!</br>And with it, too, they force their ways, these tears!</br>My bosom's feelings all I cannot quell&mdash;</br>I cannot hush all sorrows.  Future years</br>Seem dark as chaos.  Endless doubts and fears</br>Present themselves wher'er my eyes I cast.</br>And then the past in beauteous rays appears,</br>Like a bright star amidst the tempest's blast,</br>And gives an edge.  But, oh!  farewell!  We part &mdash; all's past!</br>"]
