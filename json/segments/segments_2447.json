["'Tis Night &mdash; and now the scowling sky comes down</br>In one wild blast that hurls its load of snow;</br>Darkness and death!  the air is all a frown,</br>The storm is pelting, and the winds they blow!</br>So dark, the traveller might only know,</br>By the white robe upon him thickening fast,</br>What enemy was warring on him so;</br>And as he casts his eye down, fears the blast</br>His limbs is bleaching, starts, and hurries o'er the waste.", "But even now his heart is fluttering,</br>To feel the storm his mortal mansion rack,</br>To see the tempest out upon the wing,</br>And feel it fling his mantle to his back;</br>But nothing to the traveller seems to make</br>So close his vestments cling, his heart so warm,</br>As that which wraps its flutterings to partake</br>Of the congenial spirit of the storm,</br>Until he sees, and shrinks, abroad the Almighy's form.", "Again it raves itself to ease &mdash; again</br>It comes as if \"'twould crack its cheeks,\" and heav'n</br>Had wag'd to lay earth's honors on the plain:</br>By the wild wind the birds are chased and driv'n;</br>Loud cracks the oak, a sign that he has giv'n</br>His honors over to the furious foe;</br>Again it comes, it comes, &mdash; 'tis burst, 'tis riven</br>From all the thousand ties that chained below,</br>And from its venerable base of long ago.", "O!  wind, that art the poet's element; &mdash; O!  thou,</br>That art the fanning of his restless deep;</br>The goaded fancy longs to burst the brow,</br>And beats against the boundaries that would keep</br>It from its fellow bird before the sweep</br>Of tempest, tost and bandied in the sky,</br>Till in its headlong haste, it fain would leap</br>Itself, and lost in liberty to fly,</br>Would wing its way to heav'n and win eternity.</br>"]
