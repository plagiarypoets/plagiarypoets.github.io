["Hence!  far hence, corroding care,</br>Envy foul, and black despair:</br>Hence be banish'd every pain,</br>Looks demure, and cold disdain.", "Welcome mirth, and festive song,</br>Welcome all thy jocund throng;</br>Be thou, and only thou our guide,</br>Ev'ry gloomy thought deride.", "Blythsome let us sing and play,</br>All the gladsome, live-long day:</br>Life was form'd for joy and love,</br>Emblem of the state above.", "Fill, then, fill the flowing glass,</br>Chearful let the goblet pass;</br>While the sprightly health goes round,</br>Let the jovial rebecs sound.", "Happy!  truly happy he!</br>Ever tranquil, ever free,</br>Who enjoys a state so blest,</br>By nor cares or fears distrest.</br>"]
