["From themes impertinent, the thick-scrall'd pane</br>At length a respite craves. &mdash; The jest obscene,</br>Acrostick's fulsome note, or slander's sting,</br>Alike I hate &mdash; detest &mdash; Be it my wish,</br>In grateful lines, justly to celebrate</br>A NORFOLK DUMPLING'S praise; &mdash; Belov'd repast!</br>With extasy I name thee!

Oh, could I paint thee</br>In different vestments clad!  When at Meridian</br>Joan waits her faithful messmate, how thou'rt seen</br>Majestically rob'd!  Whilst round thy throne</br>Molosses rolls his salutary tide</br>Luxuriant! &mdash; Nor in estimation less</br>Art held, when wallowing in the golden flood</br>Of pease and bacon soup!....", "&mdash;Here bait, my pen!</br>Lest like thy poet thou grow'st faint describing</br>What taste alone can prove! &mdash; Be Norfolk then</br>For Dumplings, Nogg, and Plenty ever fam'd!</br>"]
