["Scotch fiddle, fare the well!  the night dogs bark,</br>Their wild notes with thy drowsy tones are blending,</br>Rouse from his reverie som boozy spark,</br>From porter-house or tavern homeward wending;</br>Resume thy case again, thou wantest mending,</br>And thy worn strings make droning minstrelsy;</br>The squeaking tone with city vespers blending,</br>Mixe with the distant hum of nightly glee,</br>In drowsy concert sleepy maketh me.", "Yet once again, farewel, Scotch fiddle dear</br>(For dear thou art to those that buy thy lay)</br>Ah!  little recked I of thy tones so clear,</br>That scare love making catlings far away.</br>How often have I scraped whole nights away,</br>And murdered tunes the world hath never known;</br>What time to dancing wights and damsels gay,</br>I tuned thy strings, and fiddled all alone:</br>That I survive these nights, sweet fiddle, is thine own.", "Hark!  as my lingering footsteps slow retire,</br>Some airy minstrel wakes thy worn out string!</br>'Tis Church's ghost, come from Tartarean fire!</br>\"Scotch ointment,\" stead of rosin pure he brings.</br>And hark!  how sweet th' annointed fiddle rings!</br>Fainter and fainter in receding swell,</br>As the pure spirit spreads his singed wings,</br>My fingers itch to play the wizard spell,</br>But 'twill not be &mdash; SCOTCH FIDDLE, fare the well!</br>"]
