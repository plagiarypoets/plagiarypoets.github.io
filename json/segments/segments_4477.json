["My groves and my woodlands are green,</br>Fair lilies my vallies adorn;</br>Each rose in her splendour is seen,</br>Nor wishes th' approach of the morn;</br>No frosts of the winter are here,</br>So killing to love and to flow'rs;</br>The ri'lets their heads they now rear,</br>And eglantine graces my bow'rs.", "My brooks glide with murmur along,</br>Their streams are transparently clear;</br>While birds in an elegant song,</br>With music salute my glad ear;</br>My trees in their glory are seen,</br>Where branches the leaves now adorn,</br>O!  colour a beautiful green;</br>Yet please not my bosom forlorn.", "But ah!  would sweet Phillis come here</br>And grace with her presence m bow'r;</br>What joys!  and what transports sincere,</br>On a bosom so tender she'd pour.</br>Then Phillis the fairest of fair,</br>No longer fly from the fond swain,</br>Whose doom, if not lov'd, is despair;</br>For nought can alleviate his pain.</br>"]
