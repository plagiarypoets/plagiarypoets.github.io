["In a Theatre sad and alone,</br>An Actor forsaken complain'd,</br>And whilst he accus'd the false Town,</br>Conscious worth to support him remain'd.</br>The wind that blew round shrill and keen</br>Return'd all his sighs with a sigh,</br>And the trees of the nodding side-scene</br>Seem'd to murmur a mournful reply!", "\"Alas!  simple youth that I was!\"</br>Thus sadly his grief he display'd,</br>\"Oh!  ere I had seen this fine place,</br>'Twere better I never had play'd!</br>I appear'd, and enraptur'd they gaz'd!</br>I spoke, and they cried, how divine!</br>I mov'd, ev'ry action they prais'd!</br>When was Kemble himself e'er so fine!", "\"Ah, why!  by this favour deceiv'd,</br>Did I fancy no change would ensue!</br>And could I not tell I receiv'd</br>The homage to novelty due?</br>To think that a town of such wit</br>Should prove so preposterous and wild,</br>Great Kemble and Siddons to quit,</br>And exclusively favour a child!", "\"What though, touch'd with tragical fire,</br>My temples Melpomene crown'd!</br>What though, when they see me expire</br>The ladies sit weeping around!</br>Ah, Roscius, thy hopes are in vain,</br>Thy visions delusive forego!</br>See to Kemble the Town turn again,</br>On him all its smiles to bestow!", "\"For you imitative young fools,</br>Impell'd by no impulse divine,</br>Repair to your nurseries and schools,</br>Nor longer in tragedy shine!</br>Though o'er the wide kingdom you rov'd,</br>'Tis in vain you your fall would resist,</br>'Tis mine to be courted and lov'd,</br>'Tis yours to be laugh'd at and hiss'd!", "\"Now let me this kind Town engage,</br>To see me play here once again,</br>To hear my heroical rage,</br>And list to my amorous pain!</br>Oh!  then, if I fail to delight,</br>If Roscius no longer can please,</br>If, grown disagreeable to sight,</br>He's lost all his graces and ease.", "\"Then, Criticks, to Kemble repair,</br>And engross the wide Pit's foremost seat,</br>Squeeze, press, crowd, and languish for air,</br>And faint in December with heat!</br>While Roscius forgotten and gone,</br>No longer your thoughts shall engage,</br>Unless by a pale paper-moon,</br>His ghost should glide over the stage!\"</br>"]
