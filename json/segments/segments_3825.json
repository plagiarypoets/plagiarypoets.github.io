["We've seen the soft season of Spring,</br>When verdure bedeck'd every grove,</br>When harmony touch'd every string,</br>And nature was transport and love.</br>With roses and myrtles array'd,</br>The graces and loves in his train,</br>Hot summer his visit has paid,</br>Maturing the fruits of the plain.", "And now yellow Autumn appears,</br>Fair waving on Britain's rich shore;</br>With prospects of plenty he chears,</br>And Ceres displays all her store.</br>But soon horrid WINTER will come;</br>Inclement his breezes will blow;</br>No more shall we carelessly roam</br>Where the sweet-fabl'd rivulets flow.", "No more shall we hear the gay note</br>Of choristers hailing the morn;</br>No rapturous accents shall float,</br>From the woodland, the brake, or the thorn:</br>No more shall be heard in the dale</br>To pass the sad moments away,</br>But tempest descend in the gale,</br>And Nature's whole beauties decay.", "Then hasten, ye virgins, be kind,</br>While the swains their fond wishes declare,</br>O!  throw not their vows to the wind,</br>Nor give them to doubt and despair.</br>'Ere Winter deforms every scene,</br>To her swain if my Phillis will yield,</br>Content in his cottage shall reign,</br>Tho' tempests may rage in the field.", "How sweetly the moments will roll,</br>When Phillis her strains shall rehearse!</br>While THOMSON shall ravish the soul,</br>Or SHENSTONE dissolve with his verse.</br>What more can a shepherd desire!</br>Ye gods!  let this fortune be mine;</br>And let love still with bountiful fire,</br>Each pleasure improve and refine.</br>"]
