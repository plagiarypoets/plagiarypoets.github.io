["I.</br>Descend, descend, ye sweet Aonian maids,</br>Leave the Parnassian shades,</br>The joyful Hymeneal sing,</br>And to a lovelier Belle</br>Than fiction can devise, or eloquence can tell,</br>Your vocal tributes bring.</br>And you, ye winged choristers, that fly</br>In all the pensile gardens of the sky,</br>Chant thro' th' enamel'd grove,</br>Stretch from the trembling leaves your little throats,</br>With all the wild variety of artless notes,</br>But let each note be love.</br>Fragrant Flora, queen of May,</br>All bedight with garlands gay,</br>Where in the smooth-shaven green</br>The spangled cowslips variegate the scene,</br>And the rivulet between,</br>Whispers, murmurs, sings,</br>As it stoops, or falls, or springs;</br>There spread a sofa of thy softest flowers,</br>There let the bridegroom stay,</br>There let him hate the light, and curse the day,</br>And dun the tardy hours.", "II.</br>But see the bride &mdash; she comes with silent pace,</br>Full of majesty and love;</br>Not with a nobler grace</br>Look'd the imperial wife of Jove,</br>When erst ineffably she shone</br>In Venus' irresistible, inchanting zone.</br>Phoebus, great god of verse, the nymph observe,</br>Observe her well;</br>Then touch each sweetly-trem'lous nerve</br>Of thy resounding shell:</br>Her like huntress-Dian paint,</br>Modest, but without restraint;</br>From Pallas take her decent pace,</br>With Venus sweeten all her face,</br>From the Zephyrs steal her sighs,</br>From thyself her sun-bright eyes;</br>Then baffled, thou shalt see,</br>That as did Daphne thee,</br>Her charms description's force shall fly,</br>And by no soft persuasive sounds be brib'd</br>To come within INVENTION'S narrow eye;</br>But all indignant shun its grasp, and scorn to be describ'd.", "III.</br>Now see the bridegroom rise,</br>Oh!  how impatient are his joys!</br>Bring zephyrs to depaint his voice,</br>Bring light'ning for his eyes.</br>He leaps, he springs, he flies into her arms,</br>With joy intense,</br>Feeds ev'ry sense,</br>And sultanates o'er all her charms.</br>Oh!  had I Virgil's comprehensive strain,</br>Or sung like Pope, without a word in vain,</br>Then should I hope my numbers might contain,</br>Engaging nymph, thy boundless happiness,</br>How arduous to express!</br>Such may it last to all eternity:</br>And may thy lord with thee,</br>Like two coeval pines in Ida's grove,</br>That interweave their verdant arms in love,</br>Each mutual office chearfully perform,</br>And share alike the sunshine, and the storm;</br>And ever, as you flourish hand in hand,</br>Both shade the shepherd and adorn the land,</br>Together with each growing year arise,</br>Indissolubly link'd, and climb at last the skies.</br>"]
