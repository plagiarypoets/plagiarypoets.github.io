["Hence, loathed Gout!  most dreaded fiend to Ease,</br>When born, or of what lineage, unknown;</br>Vain all research to quell the stern disease,</br>Physic in trial a defeat must own;</br>Med'cine cannot the fev'rish torrent stem,</br>Nor at the secret source its subtilty o'erwhelm.", "Whether it sprang from high Patrician race,</br>By season'd viands, and distemper'd cates,</br>When at nocturnal feasts, (O dire disgrace!)</br>To please the taste, were lavish'd whole estates;</br>Or from Lycurgus' meagre fare it came,</br>When he, by wholesome laws, advanc'd the Spartan fame:", "Too deep the myst'ry for my Muse to tell.</br>To check its rage, and mitigate the pain,</br>She knows, alas!  by sad experience, well,</br>And brings the lenient Sisters in her train;</br>But chief is She, who bids us ills endure,</br>The other three by time may form a partial cure.", "But what is life, without love or wine,</br>Without the orgies of the mystic bowl?</br>Let moralists their mental joys define,</br>But sweeter far the midnight flow of soul.</br>Gout!  then attack &mdash; I'll brave thy greatest ill,</br>And fall, like valiant BEVILL, on the topmost hill.</br>"]
