["'Tis sweet to watch the gems that stud the sky,</br>Strewn o'er the concave, ebon vault of night;</br>'Tis sweet to watch the meteors as they fly,</br>With streaming blue, and dazzling wild-fires bright;</br>'Tis sweet to view the pale and icy light</br>Of the fair moon, the brightest gem among</br>The purple diadem with silver dight,</br>And veil'd with thin grey clouds, that fly along</br>Through the wide air in hasty, varied throng.", "'Tis sweet to watch the bosom of old ocean,</br>Hurrying from out his coral, crystal caves,</br>And rocking to and fro, with cradling motion,</br>Lulling the vessel with his briny waves;</br>While Cynthia dancing on his grassy graves,</br>Shows the lone mariner &mdash; who to the low</br>Sound of his oar against the water &mdash; braves</br>A song &mdash; while quicker still he strives to row,</br>To reach his humble home, and smile away his woe.", "'Tis sweet to watch the shadows stealing slow</br>Along the vale of eve &mdash; the sun decline;</br>'Tis sweet to see the sun-beams gently go</br>Down the bright path of Sol, with ray divine;</br>'Tis sweet to see the star of evening shine:</br>But at this hour, with sacred silence blest,</br>While other thoughts are absent be it mine,</br>Of men and of their minds, to fly in quest,</br>While their dread passions, pleasures, all are lull'd to rest.</br>"]
