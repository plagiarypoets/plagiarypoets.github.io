["As gallant DUNCAN and his squadron ride</br>In Yarmouth waves, the welcome tidings greet</br>His raptur'd ears, that on the foaming tide</br>At length appear Batavia's hostile fleet:</br>Forthwith his sailors loose the spacious sail,</br>And give, with joyful shouts, its bosom to the gale.", "Now on the main his mighty castles roll,</br>And soon advance Batavia's ships in sight:</br>Unbounded transport fills his veteran soul,</br>He burns with ardour to begin the fight;</br>His fearless seamen, to their country true,</br>Like angry lions pant to meet the foes in view!", "At once, undaunted, through their yielding line</br>Immortal DUNCAN makes his dreadful way,</br>Expiring groans and uproar huge combine</br>T' increase the horrors of the bloody fray;</br>Like trembling XERXES, hosts of Dutchmen stand,</br>And view, with anxious hearts, the conflict from the land!", "Nor of DE WINTER, of no vulgar fame,</br>The humble Muse withholds her share of praise:</br>So brave a warrior and so great a name</br>Demand, at least, a portion of her lays,</br>Pleas'd, she proclaims that generous Britons know</br>How great the pleasure is to laud a valiant foe!", "Long time DE WINTER, on his blood-stain'd deck</br>With dauntless courage, bids his cannons roar,</br>Nor cease their thunders 'till his ship a wreck</br>Is made, and strew'd with horrid carnage o'er;</br>Then adverse fate compels him to resign</br>Himself, and nine large tow'rs &mdash; the noblest of his line!", "Oh, may BRITANNIA of the ocean reign</br>Alone the Queen, 'till time shall be no more!</br>May no cabals her list of glories stain,</br>Nor banish peace and commerce from her shore:</br>But ever ready may her thunder be</br>To lay the tyrant low &mdash; and set th' oppressed free!</br>"]
