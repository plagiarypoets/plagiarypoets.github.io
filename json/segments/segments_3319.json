["Poets, Sir Blue, have maul'd Thee sore,</br>Just like great Burleigh heretofore;</br>Spencer to Him a Foe We see,</br>And P&mdash;pe was never Friend to Thee;</br>But Prose extols a Cecil's Name,</br>And Cambden gives a Right to Fame;</br>Who then, most admirable Knight,</br>Thy matchless Actions shall recite?</br>Say, what Historian wilt Thou fix on,</br>P&mdash;t, N&mdash;r&mdash;n, A&mdash;u&mdash;l, or Oldm&mdash;n?</br>"]
