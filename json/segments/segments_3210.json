["Here rests from song and bacchanalian mirth,</br>A wag, to music, glee, and song well known,</br>Apollo frown'd not on his humble birth,</br>And rosy Bacchus mark'd him for his own.", "True to that god, sincere as to his lass,</br>The god an ample recompense did send;&mdash;</br>He gave the minstrel all he had &mdash; a glass;</br>'Twas all he wish'd &mdash; 'twas dearer than a friend.", "But of his failings here no more disclose,</br>He had his virtues, let them step between,</br>And say, \"Poor Charley!  sleep in soft repose,</br>'Till Nature's God shall change the gloomy scene.\"</br>"]
