["When first my sage Mother began to advise,</br>\"Dearest Nancy (said she) to be virtuous and good,</br>To treacherous Man shut your Ears and your Eyes.\"</br>I promis'd for certain I wou'd if I cou'd.</br>On the Green when I danc'd, and the Lads call'd me fair,</br>While sighing and flatt'ring on Tip-toe they stood,</br>They begg'd I believe them, their Vows were sincere;</br>I told them I certainly wou'd if I cou'd.", "And when my dear Jockey appear'd on the Plain,</br>Each elderly Maiden and ill-natur'd Prude,</br>All bid me beware of the blooming young Swain;</br>I said, with a Sigh, I wou'd if I cou'd.</br>He approach'd with Delight, and call'd me sweet Maid;</br>Then whisper'd with all the Respect that he shou'd,</br>If I offer'd my Hand, you'd refuse, I'm afraid;</br>I, laughing, reply'd, I wou'd if I cou'd.", "Those Smiles are propitious, the Shepherd then cry'd,</br>Thy Meaning, tho' humble, be soon understood,</br>We'll meet in the Morn, and I'll make you my Bride;</br>I promis'd, with Blushes, I wou'd if I cou'd.</br>We met this blest Morning, and hasten'd away,</br>For my Shepherd is honest, and faithful, and good:</br>And I, simple I, said I've love and obey;</br>But certainly meant, that I wou'd if I cou'd.</br>"]
