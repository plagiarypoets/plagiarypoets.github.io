["Dear shepherd, how came you to say</br>That our grief was succeeded by mirth,</br>When the soul of the BARD flew away,</br>And his body scarce cold in the earth.", "For myself I will answer with truth,</br>Altho' it is twelve years and more</br>Since wedlock did join me (in youth)</br>To a swain that I love and adore;", "Yet surely I may be allow'd</br>Young CORYDON'S death to bemoan,</br>For, amongst a numerous croud,</br>I am not dejected alone.", "Each night, when the nymphs and gay swains</br>Gather round me to spend the cool eve,</br>I silently steal from the plains,</br>And wander away to his grave.", "Whilst thro' the lone church-yard I stray,</br>I gather some cypress and yew;</br>Pale Luna's soft beams show the way</br>To his grave, where these mourners I strew.", "When prostrate I lay on his urn,</br>Fancy brought all his form to my view;</br>But, alas!  he can never return,</br>He had wav'd an eternal adieu.", "In great perturbation of mind,</br>I follow'd in hopes to embrace;</br>But I found that I grasp'd at the wind,</br>Tho' fancy still view'd the dear face:", "Then shaking his head, seem'd to mourn,</br>Saying STELLA, go home to thy love;</br>Thy CORYDON ne'er can return,</br>He's singing with seraphs above.", "The garland I wore he did make,</br>With buds from his own, he did say;</br>While he liv'd I did wear't for his sake,</br>But now I will throw it away.", "His wreath sweetly blossom'd at morn,</br>While on his dear brow it did sit;</br>But at eve thrown into his urn,</br>No brow but his own it would fit.", "That wreath by the muses was giv'n;</br>They with myrtles immortal did twine,</br>And now he's immortal in heav'n,</br>While his works will immortally shine.</br>"]
