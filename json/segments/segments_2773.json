["Come rosy health, celestial maid,</br>Why this delay to yield me aid?</br>Swift from the rural cell advance,</br>The rural cell of temperance,</br>For well I trow in such a cell,</br>And not in courts thou lov'st to dwell.</br>Fair source whence all our pleasures sprung,</br>Come rosy health, and with thee bring</br>The gallant ever chearful crew,</br>Of youthful joys, thy offspring true.", "At thy appearance black Despair</br>With Pain, stalks off, a sullen pair,</br>Pale Fear of Melancholy bred,</br>Sickness that hangs the drooping head,</br>Slowly retreat; in Chloe's face</br>Revives the long-forgotten grace:</br>The bloom of beauty on thee waits,</br>Which Art but faintly imitates.", "If thou art absent, who can say,</br>How irksome moves the tedious day!</br>What can enable man to bear</br>So long a trial, so severe?</br>Patience alone can give relief,</br>Patience along can smile at grief,</br>Patience can comfort in the hour,</br>When ev'ry limb has lost its pow'r,</br>When, to take up the cumb'rous word,</br>The tongue can scarce the strength afford.</br>Tully of old taught how the wise</br>The violence of the pain despise.</br>Happy, who learns from that fair page,</br>How weak, how impotent, its rage!</br>Happy who learns from Shaftesbury,</br>That Vice alone is misery.", "If thee, fair Health, but deign to come,</br>The active limbs their use resume,</br>The tongue, in that propitious hour,</br>Hap'ly regains its former pow'r.</br>The soul at thy return revives,</br>And all the man within us lives.</br>From dreary couch of Sickness free,</br>We taste the sweets of Liberty.</br>"]
