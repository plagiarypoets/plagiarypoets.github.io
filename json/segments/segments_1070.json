["In a dark cave which never feels a ray</br>Of vivifying light from Phoebus' beam,</br>Where spiders weave their webs, and crickets play,</br>Or softly singing, like a virgin scream;</br>Trees which a century past full old did seem;</br>Elms, oaks, and firs in mournful order grow:</br>This we the cave of Melancholy deem!</br>Sweet Melancholy!  blessing unknown to few!</br>And Solitude enjoy'd beneath the withering yew.", "A yellow paleness spreads all o'er her face,</br>Nor wanton art in mazes weave her hair;</br>A wither'd leaness, to the fair disgrace,</br>And tear-stain'd eyes, sad tokens of despair,</br>Are the indisputable marks she bear;</br>Pensive and slow with even steps she goes,</br>Giving a thought to every murd'ring care,</br>All noisy pomp, and worldly pride her foes,</br>And to the silent ruins vents she all her woes.", "Oft by the lustre of the moon she walks</br>On the low bank of some pellucid fountain,</br>Or to herself in wild distraction talks,</br>At the firm basis of a lofty mountain,</br>Years, months, and weeks, and days she's always counting;</br>How long 'twill be before the body dead;</br>How long before her tow'ring sprits mounting,</br>Are to the summit of her wishes fled,</br>And all her yearings after Heaven are sped.", "This, this is Melancholy, sober sage;</br>Thus dwells the soul on earth that's ever mourning;</br>Nought can, below, this fond desire assuage,</br>Which, tho' once conquer'd, ever is returning,</br>And with new ardor, for its absence, burning;</br>Is fed by silence, save the chearless noise</br>Of ravens, bats, and owls, who sweet repose are scorning.</br>She beats her heaving breast and sadly sighs,</br>Longs to hear heavenly trumpets sound, and then she dies.</br>"]
