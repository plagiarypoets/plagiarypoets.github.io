["Look on the sky!  look while its glories last!</br>See the Sun's harbingers!  Those purple hues&mdash;</br>Those roseate tints &mdash; that golden girdle vast,</br>That fades into the blue, and strives to lose</br>The splendid in the delicate!  Who that views</br>These varied wonders, does not grieve, to know</br>That they must vanish with these twinkling dews,</br>Soon as the Sun his dazzling orb shall shew,</br>He whom they herald forth &mdash; He by whose light they glow?", "Look on the silent lake it pictures forth,</br>Chastened, the brightness of the morning sky.</br>From polished South far up to utmost North</br>The mingled colors of the rainbow lie,</br>Seen through the early mist that lightly by</br>Floats on the breeze.  The coming Sun will cast</br>A brightness on it that will blast the eye,</br>And these bright splendors will no longer last</br>Than their bright types in heaven.  The Sun approaches fast.", "Now fade these gentler beauties &mdash; every tint</br>Lost in a blaze of undistinguished light,</br>And he who did these pictures fair imprint</br>Upon the sullen sable of the night,</br>Now dashes all into confusion bright.</br>But who will grieve, when to our eyes is given</br>All nature in a moonlike splendor dight&mdash;</br>A lake from which each shadowy mist is driven</br>A glory-shedding Sun, for a soft-painted Heaven!", "Life dawns in beauty on the gloomy past,</br>Such joys as this world gives are strewed around</br>In fair profusion; promising to last</br>Till the dread trump its warning note shall sound.</br>But life's delights are still a weakness found,</br>As rainbows glow not in the clear blue sky,</br>And he to paltry things is meanly bound</br>Who joys not that the \"perfect day\" is nigh,</br>When all delights are merged in simple bliss on high.</br>"]
