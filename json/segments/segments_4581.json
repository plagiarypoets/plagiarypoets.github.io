["Each shepherd still praises his maid</br>When fancy and spirit combine;</br>Why should I then, dear girl, be afraid</br>To celebrate charms such as thine?</br>Though rough and unpolish'd my verse,</br>I mean not my strains to refine;</br>Yet I cannot refrain to rehearse</br>The charms of my Kate so divine.", "When so lately I bade you adieu,</br>My heart torn with sorrow and grief,</br>I thought, without ceasing, on you,</br>And tears then afforded relief:</br>I consider'd, how short is our bliss!</br>I reflected, that misery's sure!</br>I said to my heart, Think on this,</br>And let patience afford you a cure!", "Can patience (said love) assuage care,</br>And teach me the charms to forget;</br>The charms of my ever-dear fair,</br>And say, Cease to repine and to fret?</br>Oh!  no &mdash; let it never be said</br>That patience exists with true love:</br>I shall soon see again the dear maid&mdash;</br>This only can sorrow remove.", "My happiness then will return,</br>When I shall revisit my fair;</br>I shall cease to lament and to mourn,</br>And then bid adieu to my care:</br>Fly swift ev'ry hour, and each day,</br>Oh hear! &mdash; and oh grant my request!</br>And when with my fair I shall say,</br>'Tis now that I'm happy and blest!</br>"]
