["Hence moping melancholy!</br>Enormous birth of black Cocytus' flood,</br>And nurs'd by stealth-suck'd blood</br>'Mongst ghastly sights and scenes unholy;</br>Waste the lazy, lagging hours,</br>Where darkness visible expands her wing,</br>And birds ill-boding sing;</br>There joyn self-knawing care,</br>Associate too with pale despair,</br>Sequester'd from all joy-creating powers.", "See, in yonder sacred grove</br>Form'd for scenes of mirth and love,</br>Where Ivies with a close embrace</br>The Oaks their ancient husbands bless,</br>Nymphs and swains a joyful train</br>In mazy circles tread the plain.</br>While Colin Clout in aukward measure</br>Tunes his oaten pipe of pleasure.</br>See them hop and dance, and play</br>Void of sorrow &mdash; blith and gay;</br>While their eyes untaught by art</br>Speak with the language of the heart;</br>While simplicity and truth</br>Heighten ev'ry charm of youth;</br>And the lips unskill'd in guile</br>Speak amorous thro' a melting smile;</br>While their hearts with raptures melt,</br>Raptures blest by peasants felt.", "Come, my FLORIO, come alone,</br>Let us joyn the happy throng!</br>Let us fly ambition's haunts,</br>Where fawning adulation cants.</br>To the country let us haste;</br>There partake the sweet repast</br>Of cordial friendship; in some vale</br>Far from noisy pomp we'll dwell,</br>And when inclination moves</br>Share the joys the country proves:</br>Or if contemplations wings</br>Waft our souls to nobler things,</br>Knit in friendship's sacred tye</br>Together to her shrine we'll fly;</br>There with Bee-like skill explore</br>The richest sweets in all her store;</br>And in memory's magazine</br>Hoard our luxury of gain.</br>Then return, and in our cott</br>Trace the mazy turns of thought;</br>And with Ant-like zeal prepare</br>Mental food for all the year.</br>"]
