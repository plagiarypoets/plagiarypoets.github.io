neere,</br>No beasts do graze upon the neighbour hils,</br>No chirping birds the cliffes with ecchos fils;</br>Black sollitude there alwayes walkes the round</br>With foulded armes and eyes bent to the ground.</br>Upon the top of all the house was rear'd</br>A Tower, which so exceeding high appear'd,</br>That it Ixion-like did seeme to kisse</br>The clouds, on top of which there seated is</br>One called providence, who holds a glasse</br>Wherewith she sees what's done in every place</br>Beneath the Cope, with this she doth espie</br>The drifts of Kings, and hidden plots descrie,</br>A huge high wall was built about the place</br>In which not any port or entrance was</br>Except one private posterne, which was kept</br>By a grave Sire whose secrecy was clept.</br>The Hart comes to the doore and safely knocks,</br>The watchfull Porter with long snowie locks</br>And beard, soon heard the sound, and soon drew neer,</br>But ere he did unlock, askt who was there,</br>A friend quoth the Hart, then he enquir'd his name,</br>What was his errand and from whence he came,</br>With such wise answers, did the Hart him win,</br>That he unlockt the gate, and let him in;</br>Then did a goodly groome discretion height,</br>To Paliteas Hall conduct him right,</br>Where on such uncouth shapes of things he gaz'd,</br>That like a Statue he stood still amazd.</br>Upon an arch sat Politea high,</br>With many Dames in seemely order by.</br>And though she and the Ladies seemd to be,</br>As jolly Dames as eyes could wish to see,</br>Yet she alas was changd in face and grace,</br>Ere since the faire Astrea lost her place</br>And most part of her traine, that sate hereby</br>Were but meere shades made to delude the eye,</br>But fierce ambition beaten and repeld</br>From her attempt in the Phlegrean field</br>Where she was hunting them, earths gracelesse fries</br>To mount on Mountaines, and to climbe the skies,</br>Yet still retaind her former spight and hate,</br>Although the blow did much her strength abate,</br>But having provd the prowesse  of the Gods</br>And to her cost and sorrow seene the odds,</br>She would no more in armes against them go,</br>But meane to single out a weaker foe</br>Great Politea that renowned Queene</br>Was she on whom she vowd to wreck her teene,</br>But laying steely armes and shield aside</br>Another way to work her ends she tryd;</br>She by a treaty thought to get more gaine</br>Then ere by open force she could attaine,</br>A beautious Lady in her traine she hid</br>Which high desire her all in white she clad</br>And with an Olive wreath she dight her head,</br>And in her hand she likewise carried</br>An Olive branch, a hundred Maids of honour</br>(With Olive likewise crownd) did waight upon her,</br>Though these like messengers of peace were clad</br>Yet warre and murther in their hearts they had,</br>For they were all begirt with faulchions keene,</br>Which underneath their vestures were not seene,</br>She these instructs with wondrous subtilties,</br>Under pretence of Friendship to surprise</br>Queene Politeas fort, but when she came</br>Neere to the place, they sent a crafty Dame,</br>Before unto the Castle, to obtaine amaine,</br>A safe conduct for desire, and her traine.</br>This speedy Herald delectation height,</br>As faire a creature to the outward sight,</br>As ever eye beheld, and yet was shee</br>As foule deform'd a monster as could be,</br>Besides her outward grace she had a tongue,</br>Most skillfull to perswade, and passing strong;</br>Shee having entred Politeas Hall,</br>Where then was sitting mongst her Ladies all</br>Betweene Religion, and Astrea faire,</br>So wittily her messuage did declare,</br>That Politea gave her free consent,</br>That foule desire and all her Rabblement,</br>Might come into the fortresse, all in vaine</br>Astrea and her fellowes did complaine;</br>And like Liceas priests with flaring haire,</br>With out-cryes shrill, they rent the tender ayre.", "Trust not ambitious friendly shewes they cried,</br>Trust not  desire, let accesse be denied,</br>And like Troyes unbeleeved Prophesies,</br>They did presage approaching miseries,</br>In vaine they told of dangers that were neere,</br>For Politea would not lend an Eare.</br>Then fraught with griefe, and deepe disdaine they flew</br>From thence to heaven, and bid the earth adiew;</br>Thus Politea was quite left alone, Religion,</br>Justice, Temperance were gone,</br>Faith, Pitty, Fortitude, were flowne away,</br>None of Astreas traine behind would stay,</br>But hope, for she bewailing the weake state</br>Of wretched men slunck close by out at gate,</br>And to the wide world did betake her selfe,</br>A profest foe to that most damned elfe;</br>Which height despaire, she gives men much reliefe</br>That be in paine, Calamitie and griefe,</br>Now is despaire at Politeas Fort,</br>Safely arriv'd and entring the Court.</br>A Dame that kept the Tower of consent,</br>The keyes thereof did unto her present;</br>Then on she went into the Hall apace</br>Where Politea, at her feete crav'd grace,</br>Which she obteyned, but one this Condition</br>Forsooth, that she forthwith yeeld to Ambition</br>All Homage, fealtie, and Obedience,</br>And alwayes hold her for her liege and Prince;</br>To keepe these Covenants she was bound by oath,</br>So she her honour lost and freedome both;</br>Then Superstition, false-hood thirst of gaine,</br>Succeeded faire Astrea and her traine,</br>Yea bloudy Murther, and foule treachery,</br>Then streight crept closely in and there stood by,</br>And though the Hart saw them he could not spie,</br>Their ugly shapes and great deformity;</br>For they were clad in vertues faire array,</br>Which she had left in haste to flye away,</br>Their faces sprent, were with a tincture vile,</br>Made of the ordure of a Crocodile,</br>And Dragons milke, love did Medea move,</br>To use this Ceruse, first for Jasons love;</br>But the Hart viewed with most intention,</br>The workemanship and rare Invention;</br>That there on every side was to be seene,</br>Where many Statues were of famous men,</br>High in the roofe, which dust well nigh defac'd,</br>Where Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus plac'd,</br>And many other did stand them beside,</br>Which time had made unfit to be descri'd,</br>Each politicians plot was there display'd,</br>From point to point, as it at first was laid;</br>The Pope was pictur'd there, and Charles the great</br>Each helping other, to Atchieve his feat.</br>Charles for the Empire of the West did try</br>His skill the Pope for his Supremacie:</br>Pope Hildebrands foule plots were there exprest,</br>Against the Luthers Empire of the West,</br>Pope Alexander and his wicked Sonne,</br>Duke Valentine, Machivells paragon</br>Were figured there, with their damned subtilty,</br>To get the Soveraignetie of Italie,</br>And Machivell was likewise to be seene</br>There with the
