["Lives there a mortal, whose unfeeling heart</br>Was never warmed by love's celestial glow?</br>To whom his smiles no pleasure can impart,</br>His frowns could never teach one fear to know?</br>If there are beings thus exempt from woe,</br>I envy not a calm which nought can feel;</br>No!  rather let my tears for ever flow,</br>Than thus my breast against affection steel!</br>Never may chilling apathy those drops congeal.", "The mother, who beside her infant weeps,</br>Seeing the bloom of health begin to fade,</br>And marks his feverish snatches as he sleeps,</br>By dark forbodings feels her heart dismayed;</br>Yet how are all her anxious hours o'erpaid,</br>Should he survive, recovered by her care!</br>True to the feeling nature ne'er betrayed,</br>She blesses him who gave her breast to share</br>The raptures of delight, the anguish of despair.", "The duteous daughter doomed in youth to mourn,</br>When pious sorrow all her soul subdues,</br>From parents dear, by death relentless torn,</br>Vain consolations will at first refuse:</br>And cherishing whate'er her grief renews,</br>Will dwell on scenes of former tenderness;</br>Such soothing sorrow would she rather choose,</br>Than the false pleasures men call happiness,</br>For sense of duty done has still the power to bless.", "The sailor sent 'midst trackless seas to roam,</br>Regrets each object heeded not before,</br>Sadly he muses on his absent home,</br>And feels each friend he loves endeared the more;</br>But when he views again his native shore,</br>What transport flows through all his swelling veins!</br>When he recounts his toils and dangers o'er,</br>And on his knee his wondering boy sustains,</br>He envies not their bliss, who never felt his pains.</br>"]
