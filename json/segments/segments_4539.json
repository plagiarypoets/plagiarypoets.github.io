["Tho' Janus has widen'd the day,</br>And December that nurtur'd the storm,</br>Each terror suspends to convey</br>In sadden'd variety's form;</br>Thy hand, Devastation, is spread</br>O'er Nature's disconsolate face;</br>The path-way dejected I tread,</br>As the havock of winter I trace.", "How pointed with ice is the air,</br>The woodlands besplendent with frost,</br>A landskip of crystal prepare,</br>Whose beauties in rigours are lost.</br>Imprison'd behold the clear rill,</br>Irriguous that stole thro' the mead;</br>No more in soft murmurs distil</br>Its waters to cherish'd the reed.", "Those scenes where the songsters of love</br>Pour'd carols which nature excites,</br>Resounding in bliss thro' the grove,</br>Resounding with purest delights;</br>Those scenes to dejection a prey,</br>To winter's wide ruin consign'd,</br>No longer sensations convey,</br>Improving and pleasing the mind.", "For mute are the notes of the thrush,</br>The lark has his matins forgot,</br>The red-breast explores the bare bush,</br>Or for nurture intrudes on the cot.</br>No song the fresh milk-maid bestows,</br>No longer she visits the vale,</br>Where erst at the side of her cows</br>Each eve she replenish'd the pail.", "The morning distressful of mien,</br>From slumbers of sluggish delay,</br>Now opens a wide-wasting scene,</br>At once both terrific and gay;</br>Aerial treasures of snow</br>The mountains and valleys invest,</br>With what a bright burden below</br>Is the bosom of nature oppress'd!", "Go, shepherds, attend the thick field,</br>To your ewes in the valley repair,</br>O save the young lambs from the cold,</br>They bleat for protection and care.</br>Ye neat herds go look to the kine,</br>The crib with sweet fodder supply,</br>The task of compassion is thine,</br>For herbage the meadows deny.", "Whilst the voice of the north is severe,</br>And heard thro' the trees with dismay,</br>What sorrow is that which I hear,</br>More sad than the sighs of the day!</br>'Tis Delia. &mdash; Why weeps my soft fair,</br>What opens the spring of her grief,</br>Or loosens her soft-flowing hair,</br>Can Corydon tender relief?", "She weeps o'er poor Emmeline's tomb,</br>Who fell as a wreath of the snow;</br>She fell in the pride of her bloom,</br>As bright as the heavenly bow.</br>Her voice was the music of spring,</br>Her heart was ineffable love,</br>Her face all that beauty could bring,</br>In mildness she rival'd the dove.", "Thou bright as the moon on the main,</br>My Delia no longer deplore,</br>Nor harrow thy bosom with pain,</br>For Emmeline must be no more.</br>Permit I partake of thy woe,</br>The privilege can you refuse?</br>Together, my fair one, we'll go,</br>And death of his triumph accuse.", "To her manes rever'd let us raise</br>Of flowers an elegant mound,</br>The spring shall supply us with bays,</br>And Flora shall purple the ground.</br>In vain are you delug'd in tears,</br>O grant me your grief to beguile,</br>Exempt from despondency's fears,</br>We'll meet the new year with a smile.</br>"]
