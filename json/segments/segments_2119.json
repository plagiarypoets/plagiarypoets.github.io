["Oh!  thou, from whose warm urn these waters flow,</br>Which bathe the fading lip of malady,</br>Whether thou sitt'st on crystal throne below,</br>Blessing thy balsam streamlets as they flee,</br>Or whether still I should not turn to Thee</br>Who dwell'st all-potent in that upward sphere,</br>Whence thou suppliest the earth, the stream, the sea,</br>Nor scorn'st the poorest, palest suppliant here,</br>Vouchsafe, to e'en a prayer like mine, to lend thine ear.&mdash;", "Is there a charm in this perennial draught,</br>To bid the wife for child &mdash; for husband live?</br>Will the mysterous fountain, when 'tis quaff'd,</br>This priceless boon &mdash; this blissful treasure give?</br>Will it aloof the withering canker drive,</br>That eats the rose just as its leaves are spread?</br>Will it discomfit the dark fiends which thrive</br>But on the banquet of the youthful dead?</br>Oh!  then be with the fount our nuptial garland fed.", "Floats there upon the wave a healing power</br>To guard the mother for the infant son?</br>Nor doom to others' care the helpless hour</br>Of him, our first, our lov'd &mdash; our only one?</br>Clifton!  will he by they sweet cup thus shun</br>The orphan's lot, nor mourn a mother's care?</br>Forth let thy bounteous, blessed waters run!</br>Since they're endow'd with all this power to spare,&mdash;</br>This is a friend's, a husband's, father's fondest prayer.</br>"]
