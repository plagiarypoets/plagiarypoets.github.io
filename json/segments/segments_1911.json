["There have been bright and glorious pageants here,</br>Where now grey stones and moss-grown columns lie;</br>There have been words, which earth grew pale to hear,</br>Breath'd from the cavern's misty chambers nigh:</br>There have been voices, through the sunny sky,</br>And the pine-woods, their choral hymn-notes sending,</br>And reeds and lyres, their Dorian melody,</br>With incense-clouds around the Temple blending,</br>And throngs with laurel boughs, before the Altar bending.", "There have been treasures of the seas and isles</br>Brought to the Day-god's now-forsaken throne;</br>Thunders have peal'd along the rock-defiles,</br>When the far-echoing battle-horn made known</br>That foes were on their way!  the deep wind's moan</br>Hath chill'd th' invader's heart with secret fear,</br>And from the sybil-grottoes, wild and lone,</br>Storms have gone forth, which, in their fierce career,</br>From his bold hand have struck the banner and the spear.", "The shrine hath sunk! &mdash; but thou unchanged art there</br>Mount of the voice and vision!  robed with dreams!</br>Unchanged, and rushing through the radiant air,</br>With thy dark waving pines, and flashing streams,</br>And all thy founts of song! &mdash; their bright course teems</br>With inspiration yet; and each dim haze,</br>Or golden cloud which floats around thee, seems</br>As with its mantle veiling from our gaze</br>The mysteries of the past, the gods of elder days.", "Away, vain phantasies!  doth less of power</br>Dwell round thy summit, or thy cliffs invest,</br>Though in deep stillness now, the ruin's flower</br>Wave o'er the pillars mouldering on thy breast?</br>Lift through the free blue heavens thine arrowy crest!</br>Let the great rocks their solitude regain!</br>No Delphian lyres now break thy noontide rest</br>With their full chords: &mdash; but silent be the strain!</br>Thou hast a mightier voice to speak the Eternal's reign!</br>"]
