["The burial-bell tolls heavily and drear,</br>The new-dug earth makes known departed breath,</br>Sound after sound comes murmuring on the ear,</br>And tells the triumph of devouring death.", "The plume-deck'd hearse in funeral pomp comes on;</br>Coach after coach displays a host of friends,</br>Who weep, or seem to weep, for him that's gone,</br>And thus the last sad solemn mockery ends!", "The death-bell stops &mdash; and yet another train</br>A humbler group, in still procession creep,</br>Whose limbs can scarce the lifeless weight sustain,</br>For whom no eye, not one, is seen to weep.", "The work-house pauper is by all forsook,</br>His place of quiet is the parish hole;</br>On his poor corpse no sorrowing mourners look;</br>For him, no tears of fond remembrance roll.", "And yet he once could boast of joy-fraught days,</br>Of friends who buzz'd like sun-flies round his door;</br>His feasts, while he had feasts to give, their praise!</br>And then, like reptiles, then, were seen no more.", "His hand was open, and his heart sincere!</br>To those that wanted he unsparing gave,</br>Nor thought the locusts, that he priz'd so dear,</br>Could scowl like demons on the pauper's grave.</br>"]
