["And from the pray'r of want, and plaint of woe,</br>O never, never turn away thine ear!</br>Forlorn in this bleak wilderness below,</br>Ah!  what were man, should Heav'n refuse to hear!</br>To others do, (the law is not severe)</br>What to thyself thou wishest to be done:&mdash;</br>Forgive thy foes; and love thy parents dear;</br>And friends and native land:  nor these alone;</br>All human weal and woe learn thou to make thine own.</br>"]
