["If on the favour'd sons of earth,</br>Are such superior gifts bestow'd,</br>And man, the moment of his birth,</br>Basks in the suff'rage of his God;</br>If, as the transient moments roll,</br>That wakes to life his genial powers,</br>Whilst Reason's rays illume his soul,</br>And Health smiles on his early hours;</br>Let heav'n-born Gratitude his breast enflame,</br>To that superior Power, that plann'd the wond'rous frame.", "'Tis He who bids the blooming Spring,</br>In all the pride of youth appear;</br>Her annual buds and blossoms bring,</br>That decorate the infant year;</br>'Tis He who bids mild Summer's reign,</br>With fost'ring warmth mature the soil;</br>Pourtrays the form of fruits and grain,</br>And animates the peasant's toil;</br>Nor does the night its welcome aid refuse,</br>But mitigates the heat with soft'ning dews.", "Already has this whirling sphere</br>Near half her revolution made;</br>More gladd'ning prospects now appear,</br>And plenty revels in the shade;</br>The jocund youth with vacant mind,</br>Enjoys the sweets that temp'rance brings;</br>Beneath the hawthorn sits reclin'd,</br>And with unfeigned rapture sings;</br>Whilst o'er his head th' aspiring ash tree bends,</br>And the wide spreading oak its ample shade extends.", "Now Summer's fervour rages round,</br>The sun darts fierce his burning rays;</br>The flocks now seek the covert ground,</br>And Nature pants beneath the blaze;</br>But when cool Ev'ning's moist'ning dews,</br>Full grateful on the plains descend;</br>Who can the pleasing walk refuse</br>To share the converse of a friend?</br>Where the rapt soul may genuine truths impart,</br>Nor dare to speak what's foreign to the heart.</br>"]
