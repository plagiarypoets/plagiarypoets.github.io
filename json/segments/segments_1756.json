["O modest Maid!  whom I in vain have sought</br>For many an irksome year on foreign shores,</br>Where is thy calm abode,</br>Benign Tranquility!", "Say, dost thou dwell amidst the rustic train,</br>Who in their humble hamlets seem t' escape</br>The tedious forms of life,</br>And all its rending cares?", "So Fancy whispers to the Trav'ler's ear,</br>As sad he journeys o'er the rugged steep,</br>And views the scene below,</br>Where the contending youths", "Humble the yellow CERES, or gay groupes</br>Of blushing maidens tread the verdant lawn;</br>As to the lucid stream,</br>They lead their timid flocks.", "But cruel Want, or desolating Toil,</br>Perhaps Oppression, forces them away,</br>And glooms the vernal vale,</br>And damps each rising joy.", "Nor dost thou haunt the 'lone MONK'S solemn cell,</br>Nor wander with him in the Moon's pale beam,</br>While Echo sad returns</br>His melancholy tread.", "For there each warmth represt that man should feel,</br>Dull Superstition blunts each finest sense,</br>And every bliss is lost,</br>In ignorance and pride.", "And when the brazen trumpet's piercing sound,</br>Rattles 'mongst gorgeous, Gothic palaces;</br>While in majestic Pomp's</br>Magnificent array", "Come sweeping forth high POTENTATES, and DAMES,</br>Sublime in Beauty's bloom, and WARRIORS bold</br>Stalk in the eye of Kings;</br>Alas!  THOU art not there!", "Thou fly'st alike the jovial Youths, who waste</br>The morning of their lives in wild excess,</br>And with their reason lose</br>Remembrance of thy loss.", "Nor dost thou e'er repose thee on the couch,</br>Of mutual love, from extacies too keen,</br>Joy drives thee forth awhile,</br>Then burning Jealousy.", "But O!  beneath yon range of aged yews,</br>Whose gloomy verdure awfully accords</br>With the dark scene around</br>Of Solitude and DEATH.", "There shall I find thee, gentle Maid, at last;</br>And as I moulder, may no rav'nous bird,</br>Or prowling beast of night,</br>Shatter my peaceful shroud.</br>"]
