["I.</br>From Bedlam's walls I saw thee stray,</br>A melting, trembling, constant prey</br>To ev'ry human woe!</br>Becalm thy grief, feel moderate pain,</br>Lest frantic fancy burst thy brain,</br>And make thyself thy foe!", "II.</br>If mis'ry's guests, in yonder gaol,</br>Demand thy tear, distract thy soul,</br>Let anguish not destroy!</br>But learn a rule, by reason taught,</br>That pain's worst torture lies in thought,</br>Which madmen can't employ!", "III.</br>In vain &mdash; advice but moves thee more,</br>I see it lies beyond thy pow'r,</br>To check the rising sigh!</br>Then in thy grief I'll bear a part,</br>Perhaps I thus may ease thy heart,</br>And clear thy misty eye!</br>"]
