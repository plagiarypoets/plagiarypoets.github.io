["See &mdash; from the sterile soil enrich'd with care,</br>From verdant borders of the fruitful plain,</br>From lowly plants, &mdash; from trees that wave in air,</br>From long-drawn vistas bright with golden grain,</br>From the fair range of cultur'd earth's domain,</br>When o'er her breast the plenteous harvest springs,</br>Hills fresh with dew, &mdash; or vallies soft with rain,</br>Her varied tribute Agriculture brings</br>To cheer the heart of man, and praise the King of Kings.", "As when Judea's Kings for solemn feast</br>First herds requir'd from willing subjects hands,</br>To Levites' knife, or sacrificing priest</br>They pour'd innumerous from the fertile lands;</br>So now they throng in multifarious bands:&mdash;</br>Bleat not, ye flock &mdash; nor shrink ye lowing train,</br>No altar's rites your sinless blood demands,</br>Led by the kind hand of the gentle swain,</br>Behold the peaceful sports of Ceres' bounteous reign.", "Haste! &mdash; Speed the Plough! &mdash; Upturn with glittering share</br>The deep drawn furrow. &mdash; Ye who scornful view</br>Toil's hardy sons in manly effort dare,</br>Bear hence your sneer, &mdash; this scene is not for you.&mdash;</br>Hence, to the listless, enervated crew,</br>With silken forms by wan diseases riven,</br>Whose Pride withholds from industry its due;</br>Think ye, a life to useful labor given,</br>Not more than sloth's dull sleep shall please the eye of Heaven?</br>"]
