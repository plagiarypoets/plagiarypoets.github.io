["Within that deep embowering wood was seen</br>A nymph of fairest, comliest deport</br>Grave, yet her smile was Heaven's light I ween,</br>The twilight hour she ever lov'd to court!&mdash;</br>And when the moon-beams on the rill disport,</br>Or through the branches chequer the green sward,</br>Would walk alone, and often stop full short,</br>Her bright blue eyes upraising heavenward,</br>And breathe forth accents soft, like sweetest music heard.", "These sacred haunts, the sages, as was meet,</br>Sought; and this maid yclept Solitude.</br>There Folly ne'er was seen; but, with staid feet,</br>Shunning the world's turmoil, came oft the good,</br>The sweets to taste of intellectual food.</br>Yet, ever and anon, the nymph was seen</br>To fondle a fair boy, an urchin rude,</br>And kiss his rosy lips, and sparkling een,</br>And press him to her breast, right lovingly I ween.", "And when, with sport o'ercome, beneath the shade</br>Asleep she found him, gently would essay</br>Upon her snowy breast to place his head,</br>And with his auburn ringlets fondly play;</br>Then her sweet lips to his would softly lay,</br>And balmy kisses rapturously steal;</br>Till, fearful that they would betray</br>Her wantonness, and ardent love reveal,</br>Quick she would fly away, her blushes to conceal.", "He was a sportive and most trickish wight:</br>And to reform him was her choicest pride;</br>Yet, while her speech was meet with wisdom dight,</br>He, laughing, glanc'd his roguish eye aside,</br>And all her gravest lessons would deride.</br>Often she strove to gain his venom'd darts,</br>Which he with wily skill did ever hide;</br>And when she list not, made her bosom smart,</br>And laugh'd to hear her sigh, and gloried in his art.</br>"]
