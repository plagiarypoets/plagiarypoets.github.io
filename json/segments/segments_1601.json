["Hail to thee, Cambria!  for the unfettered wind</br>Which from thy wilds even now methinks I feel,</br>Chasing the clouds that roll in wrath behind,</br>And tightening the soul's laxest nerves to steel;</br>True mountain Liberty alone may heal</br>The pain which Custom's obdurancies bring,</br>And he who dares in fancy even to steal</br>One draught from Snowdon's ever sacred spring</br>Blots out the unholiest rede of wordly witnessing.", "And shall that soul, to selfish peace resigned,</br>So soon forget the woe its fellows share?</br>Can Snowdon's Lethe from the free-born mind</br>So soon the page of injured penury tear?</br>Does this fine mass of human passion dare</br>To sleep, unhonouring the patriot's fall,</br>Or life's sweet load in quietude to bear</br>While millions famish even in Luxury's hall,</br>And Tyranny high raised stern lowers over all?", "No, Cambria!  never may thy matchless vales</br>A heart so false to hope and virtue shield;</br>Nor ever may thy spirit-breathing gales</br>Waft freshness to the slaves who dare to yield.</br>For me! . . . the weapon that I burn to wield</br>I seek amid thy rocks to ruin hurled,</br>That Reason's flag may over Freedom's field,</br>Symbol of bloodless victory, wave unfurled,</br>A meteor-sign of love effulgent o'er the world.", "&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;", "Do thou, wild Cambria, calm each struggling thought;</br>Cast thy sweet veil of rocks and woods between,</br>That by the soul to indignation wrought</br>Mountains and dells be mingled with the scene;</br>Let me forever be what I have been,</br>But not forever at my needy door</br>Let Misery linger speechless, pale and lean;</br>I am the friend of the unfriended poor,</br>Let me not madly stain their righteous cause in gore.</br>"]
