["Now twice the spring, with flowrets gay,</br>Hath 'broider'd o'er her mantle green,</br>And twice the merry month of May</br>With hawthorn deck'd the vernal scene,</br>Since I in tuneful numbers hail'd the morn</br>When thou, my heart's dear boy, in happy hour wast born.", "Nor had I miss'd the annual song,</br>When June return'd with roses crown'd;</br>But rising sorrow check'd my tongue,</br>And cloudy care hung low'ring round,</br>While in the gloomy shades of threat'ning death</br>I watch'd thy flutt'ring pulse, and fear'd thy parting breath.", "How exquisite the anxious woe,</br>The agonizing bitter grief,</br>Maternal love alone can know,</br>'Midst glimm'ring hopes of slow relief;</br>The cruel kindness of the healing art,</br>And those dim joyless smiles which rend the bursting heart!", "Dear be those cares, to mem'ry dear,</br>Which sav'd thee from an early grave;</br>And ever bless'd the genial year,</br>The milder sky, the briny-wave,</br>The healthful gale, which fading life restores,</br>Where the smooth swelling tide laves Hampton's happy shores.", "Nor sav'd in vain:  O still pursue</br>The path where truth unerring leads,</br>Where reason early may subdue</br>The wild desires which fancy feeds;</br>Circean charms, that with a magic force</br>Impel the feeble mind through youth's insensate course.", "Go on, dear boy, exert each pow'r</br>On time's rich treasures to improve;</br>And may the slowly ripening hour,</br>Pass'd in the academic grove,</br>Strength to thy mind with ancient lore impart,</br>And judgment firm to guide a warm and feeling heart.</br>"]
