["Oh, sacred memory, tablet of the heart!</br>Thou breathing shadow of departed days!</br>Still ever prompt to wake the ling'ring smart,</br>And backward lure the visionary gaze&mdash;</br>Thou tellest but of scenes that, melted by,</br>Are vanish'd now like wreaths of winter snow;</br>The tear of sorrow gems thy lucid eye,</br>And yet so beauteous is thy garb of woe,</br>Enamour'd still, we clasp thy fond regret,</br>Too tender to renounce, too pleasing to forget!", "Unpitying absence wraps in distant shroud</br>Full many a charm that deck'd our earlier doom;</br>Thy stronger radiance brightens thro' the cloud,</br>Again they flourish, and again they bloom:</br>The kindred ties that hold us down to earth,</br>The wife, the friend, the parent, sink in turn;</br>Thou livest to retrace their love and worth,</br>And snatch their image from the marble urn:</br>O'er time's dread course thy victor pinions wave,</br>And burst with eagle strength the slumbers of the grave.", "Not the wide tracts of ocean, or of land,</br>Nor all the changing seasons as they roll,</br>Can bound thy glance, repress thy glowing hand,</br>Or blot thy fairy pictures from the soul:</br>Thy viewless spirit floats amid the morn,</br>Meridian skies as sweetly they rejoice,</br>Tell of the past, and, on the evening borne,</br>We sadly hear thy melancholy voice</br>Sigh in the flutters of the trembling gale</br>That sweeps the mountain brow, or mourns along the vale.</br>"]
