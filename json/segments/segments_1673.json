["O!  much esteem'd Unknown!  and didst thou deign</br>T' accept the simple off'ring of my lyre?</br>And breathe again such pure and hallow'd strain,</br>As but the Muse and virtue could inspire?</br>O how shall I, thus lowly, dare aspire,</br>AGNES, to court thy gentle ear once more!</br>Unless some portion of thy genius fire</br>My humbled muse; then to the Southern shore</br>The charmed breeze the off'ring might convey,&mdash;</br>Nor Ora blush to weave such far inferior lay.", "Say, dost thou wander through some fragrant grove?</br>Or list the murmur of some limpid stream,</br>As by its flow'ry, verdant banks you rove,</br>When the fair star of ev'ning sheds her beam&mdash;</br>And all around as soft and calm doth seem</br>As is, fair Minstrel, thy own virtuous mind,</br>Tuning thy lyre to some romantic theme,</br>Or moral truth, or sentiment refin'd,</br>Or dedicating thy harmonious lays</br>To friendship warm, and pure &mdash; or \"too, too generous praise?\"", "From roaring storms my fancy wings her way</br>To meet on Southern shore the lovely Spring</br>To find the spot where AGNES loves to stray,&mdash;</br>And there to rest her weary shatter'd wing;</br>To listen to the sweetly warbling string</br>Of thy soft lyre, with all a sister's love;&mdash;</br>To blunt the point of Sorrow's poison'd sting;&mdash;</br>And talk together of the world above</br>'Tis vain! &mdash; the beauteous vision melts away,</br>As on the lake's still breast the last faint flush of day.</br>"]
