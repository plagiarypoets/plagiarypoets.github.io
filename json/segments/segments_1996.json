["So ends Childe Harold his last pilgrimage!&mdash;</br>Above the Malian surge he stood, and cried</br>\"Liberty!\"  and the shores, from age to age</br>Renown'd, and Sparta's woods and rocks, replied,</br>\"Liberty!\"  But a Spectre, at his side</br>Stood mocking; &mdash; and its dark uplifting high</br>Smote him: &mdash; he sank to earth in life's fair pride:</br>Sparta!  thy rocks echoed another cry,</br>And old Ilissus sighed &mdash; \"Die, generous exile, die!\"", "I will not ask sad Pity to deplore</br>His wayward errors, who thus early died:</br>Still less, Childe Harold, now thou art no more.</br>Will I say aught of genius misapplied;</br>Of the past shadows of thy spleen or pride:&mdash;</br>But I will bid the Arcadian cypress wave,</br>Pluck the green laurel from Peneus' side,</br>And pray thy spirit may such quiet have,</br>That not one thought unkind be murmur'd o'er thy grave.", "So ends Childe Harold his last pilgrimage!&mdash;</br>Ends in that region &mdash; in that land renowned,</br>Whose mighty genius lives in Glory's page,</br>And on the Muses' consecrated ground,&mdash;</br>His pale cheek fading where his brows were bound</br>With their unfading wreath!  I will not call</br>The nymphs from Pindus' piny shades profound,</br>But strew some flowers upon thy sable pall,</br>And follow to the grave a Briton's funeral.", "Slow more the plumed hearse, the mourning train,</br>I mark the long procession with a sigh,</br>Silently passing to that village fane</br>Where, Harold, thy forefathers mouldering lie;&mdash;</br>Where sleeps the mother, who with tearful eye</br>Pondering the fortunes of thy onward road,</br>Hung o'er the slumbers of thine infancy;</br>Who here, released from every human load,</br>Receives her long-lost child the same calm abode.", "Bursting Death's silence &mdash; could that mother speak&mdash;</br>When first the earth is heaped upon thy head,</br>In thrilling, but with hollow accent weak,</br>She thus might give the welcome of the dead:&mdash;</br>\"Here rest my son, with me ;&mdash; the dream is fled;&mdash;</br>The motley mask and the great coil are o'er:</br>Welcome to me, and to this wormy bed,</br>Where deep forgetfulness succeeds the roar</br>Of earth, and fretting passions waste the heart no more.", "\"Here rest! &mdash; on all thy wanderings peace repose,</br>After the fever of thy toilsome way;</br>No interruption this long silence knows;</br>Here no vain phantoms lead the soul astray:</br>The earth-worm feeds on his unconscious prey;</br>Here both shall sleep in peace till earth and sea</br>Give up their dead, at that last awful day,</br>King, Lord, Almighty Judge!  remember me;</br>And may Heav'n's mercy rest, my erring child, on thee!\"</br>"]
