["\"Haste, dearest maid, and view a sight indeed!</br>Haste, and behold upon the verdant plains,</br>Where Love exulting sports,</br>And waves his purple wings;</br>What wills the archer?  neither dart nor bow</br>Are near him laid; nought save a silken snare,</br>Which the sly urchin spreads</br>Beneath the myrtle's shade.&mdash;</br>&mdash;Stay, thoughtless child!  nor, like those cruel elves</br>By mortals called School-boys, joy in woe!</br>Oh!  spare the orphans cries,</br>And widow'd mother's tears!</br>Stay, and contemplate how they jocund rove,</br>As rising fancy bids them.  Do not go</br>To act a Demon's part,</br>Delighting to destroy.&mdash;</br>&mdash;He recks not, ELIZA!  see, the snare</br>Enfolds the fluttering warblers; CUPID springs</br>With rapture in his eyes,</br>Triumphant on the prey.&mdash;</br>&mdash;Stay yet, insatiate boy, thy murtherous hand!</br>In pity melt, and set the prisoners free;</br>For VENUS, sure, would weep</br>To view a deed so rude.</br>Though slender threads around their pretty legs</br>Thou sportive bindest, swiftly let them fly!</br>Thanks, gentle CUPID, thanks,</br>For this thy tender gift.</br>But, sure the threads which round them thou hast cast</br>Will much impede the rovers in their flight?</br>&mdash;Ah, no!  for, see, each thread</br>Around a favourite twines;</br>And the enamour'd pairs seek HYMEN'S aid.</br>The rosy God descends, and from his plumes</br>Shakes happiness and peace</br>O'er all the festive scene.\"</br>\"Alas, LORENZO!  as thou shew'st the Fair</br>The gentle blessings which from CUPID spring,</br>How didst thou sigh, to think</br>That fortune was thy foe!</br>"]
