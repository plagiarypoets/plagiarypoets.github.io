["Reclining sad beneath an aged Yew,</br>The sea, and many royal ships in view!</br>O'erwhelm'd with amorous woe, a pining swain</br>In moving accents thus bespoke his pain.", "\"Time was &mdash; and is it fled, ye pow'rs divine?</br>When bless'd I thought sweet Rosalinda mine.</br>How happy in these shades, and rural bow'rs,</br>Last summer did we pass our golden hours!</br>But now I feel the alter'd nymph's disdain,</br>She slights my love, and disregards my pain:</br>In gay delight the courtly dance she leads,</br>Herself the fairest of our faithless maids!</br>Who all, like her, their constant shepherds shun,</br>As if they took a pride to be undone!</br>These sons of Neptune, with their wanton arts,</br>Have quite debauch'd our modest virgins hearts.", "\"What tho' the Gallic fleets insult our coast,</br>And France and Spain of our inaction boast?</br>Our land and naval heroes, dress'd for show,</br>Regard no weapons now, but Cupid's bow;</br>At balls they shine, and curl their powder'd hair,</br>Bedaub'd with lace to captivate the fair:</br>Too weak their souls to feel the warriour's fire,</br>These are the mighty conquests they desire.</br>And yet with these, tho' ignominious arts,</br>Have they ensnar'd our tender virgins hearts.", "\"And shall such rivals, only, skill'd to dance,</br>The scorn of Britons, while the apes of France;</br>Shall they &mdash; who dread the daring foe to face,</br>Find in our bright assemblies any grace?</br>No, British fair! &mdash; assert your antient fame,</br>Let the brave only your protection claim;</br>Be he alone, who fights his country's cause,</br>Bless'd in your smiles, and crown'd in your applause.</br>So shall these triflers mourn their baffled arts,</br>Nor, shameful thus, delude your virgin hearts!\"", "More he had spoke &mdash; but night her mantle spread</br>And the swain rose &mdash; to seek his lonely bed.</br>"]
