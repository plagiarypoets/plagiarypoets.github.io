["Farewell, wild Harp!  whose slumbering melody</br>With venturous touch I have essayed to wake;</br>Harp, which high bards to notes of ecstasy</br>Have struck, till Heaven's blue archway seem'd to shake:</br>And some a softer tone have bid thee take,</br>While numbers passing sweet, yet wild and lorn</br>As their own fate, they pour'd from hearts that brake.</br>So the bird leans her bosom on the thorn,</br>And warbles sweetliest then, when most her breast is torn.", "And not in vain, oh!  not in vain the lay,</br>Tho' Fame should ne'er upon her votary glance;</br>Tho' he go down to darkness and decay,</br>Unwept, unhonour'd, 'mid the world's mad dance,</br>Where wealth, pomp, pleasure, mightier claims advance;</br>Yet it may loose him from care's subtle ties,</br>And soothe his soul; like incense, which perchance</br>Will not majestically mount the skies,</br>Yet scents the altar still whence first it strove to rise.", "Farewell!  there's misery in the word, yet how,</br>With eager ear upon the sound we dwell;</br>Farewell!  it dims the eye, and clouds the brow,</br>Yet the heart breaks, unless we say \"Farewell!\"</br>And oh!  my harp, unbidden notes will swell,</br>Saddening my song, as o'er thy strings I cast</br>A trembling hand; and broken accents tell</br>My heart is throbbing as I say, \"'Tis past,\"</br>And breathe to thee a long farewell, perchance a last.</br>"]
