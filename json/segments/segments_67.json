Ladies tyranning so sore;</br>And adding Anguish to the bitter Wound,</br>With which their Lives thou launcedst long afore,</br>By heaping Storms of Trouble on them daily more?", "So whilom didst thou to fair Florimel,</br>And so unto the noble Britomart:</br>So dost thou now to her, of whom I tell,</br>The lovely Amoret; whose gentle Heart</br>Thou martyrest with Sorrow and with Smart,</br>In salvage Forests, and in Desarts wide,</br>With Bears and Tygers taking heavy part,</br>Withouten Comfort, and withouten Guide;</br>That pity is to hear the Perils which the try'd.", "So soon as she,

where thro weary Travel she lay sleeping sound.", "It was to weet, a wild and salvage Man;</br>Yet was no Man, but only like in Shape,</br>And eke in Stature higher by a Span,</br>All over-grown with Hair, that could awhape</br>An hardy Heart; and his wide Mouth did gape</br>With huge great Teeth, like to a tusked Boar:</br>For he liv'd all on Ravin and on Rape</br>Of Men and Beasts; and fed on fleshly Gore,</br>The Sign whereof yet stain'd his bloody Lips afore.", "His neather Lip was not like Man nor Beast,</br>But like a wide deep Poke, down hanging low,</br>In which he wont the Relicks

Swound;</br>Ne wist whether above she were, or under ground.", "With that, she heard some one close by her side</br>Sighing and sobbing sore, as if the Pain</br>Her tender Heart in pieces would divide:</br>Which she long listning, softly ask'd again</br>What mister Wight it was that so did plain?</br>To whom thus answer'd was:  Ah!  wretched Wight,</br>That seeks to know another's Grief in

which the Sons of Men</br>Divide their Works) have past thro Heaven sheen,</br>Since I was brought into this dooleful Den;</br>During which space, these sory Eyes have seen</br>Seven Women by him

sure eat one.", "Ah!  dreadful Tidings which thou dost declare,</br>Quoth she, of all that ever hath been known;</br>Full many great Calamities and rare</br>This feeble Breast endured hath, but none</br>Equal to this, wherever I have gone.</br>But what are you, whom like unlucky Lot</br>Hath link'd with me in the same Chain attone?</br>To tell, quoth she, thee which ye see, needs not;</br>A woeful wretched Maid, of God and Man forgot.", "But what I was, it irks me to rehearse;</br>Daughter unto a Lord of high Degree,</br>That joy'd in happy Peace, till Fates perverse</br>With guileful

did lurk,</br>Till I thereto had all things ready dight.</br>So on a day, unweeting unto Wight,</br>I with that Squire agreed away to flit,</br>And in a privy place, betwixt us hight,</br>Within a Grove appointed him to meet;</br>To which I boldly came upon my feeble Feet.", "But ah!  unhappy Hour me thither brought:</br>For in that place, where I him thought to find,</br>There was I found, contrary to my Thought,</br>Of this accursed Carle of hellish kind;</br>The Shame of Men, and Plague of Woman-kind:</br>Who trussing me, as Eagle doth his Prey,</br>Me hither brought with him, as

done, as she to me hath shown;</br>For ever when he burnt in lustful Fire,</br>She in my stead supply'd his bestial Desire.", "Thus of their Evils as they did discourse,</br>And each did other much bewail and moan;</br>Lo!  where the Villain self, their Sorrow's Sourse,</br>Came to the Cave; and rolling thence the Stone,</br>Which wont to stop the Mouth thereof, that none</br>Might issue forth, came rudely rushing in;</br>And spreading over all the Floor alone,</br>'Gan dight himself unto his wonted Sin:</br>Which ended, then his bloody Banquet should begin.", "Which, when-as fearful Amoret perceiv'd,</br>She staid not th' utmost End thereof to try,</br>But like a gastly Gelt, whose Wits are reav'd,</br>Ran forth in haste with hideous Outcry,</br>For Horrour of his shameful Villany;</br>But after her full lightly he up-rose,</br>And her pursu'd as fast as she did fly:</br>Full fast she flies, and far afore him goes,</br>Ne feels the Thorns and Thickets prick her tender Toes.", "Nor Hedg, nor Ditch, nor Hill, nor Dale she stays,</br>But overleaps them all, like Roebuck light,</br>And thro the Thickets makes her nighest ways;</br>And evermore, when with regardful

Fight;</br>For ever when the Squire his Javelin shook,</br>He held the Lady forth before him right,</br>And with her Body, as a Buckler, broke</br>The Puissance of his intended Stroke.</br>And if it chaunc'd (as needs it must in Fight)</br>Whilst he on him was greedy to be wroke,</br>That any little Blow on her did light,</br>Then would he laugh aloud, and gather great Delight.", "Which subtile Slight did him encumber much,</br>And made him oft, when he would strike, forbear;</br>For hardly could he come the Carle to touch,</br>But that he her must hurt, or hazard near;</br>Yet he his Hand so carefully did bear,</br>That at the last he did himself attain,</br>And therein left the Pike-head of his Spear.</br>A Stream of cole-black Blood thence gush'd amain,</br>That all her silken Garments did with Blood bestain.", "With that, he threw her rudely on the Floor,</br>And laying both his Hands upon his Glave,</br>With dreadful Strokes let drive at him so sore,</br>That forc'd him fly aback, himself to save:</br>Yet he there-with so felly still did rave,</br>That scarce the Squire his Hand could once up-rear,</br>But (for Advantage) ground unto him gave,</br>Tracing and traversing, now here, now there;</br>For bootless thing it was to think such Blows to bear.", "Whilst thus in Battel they embusy'd were,</br>Belphoebe (raunging in that Forest wide)</br>The hideous Noise of their huge Strokes did hear,</br>And drew there-to, making her Ear her Guide.</br>Whom when that Thief approaching nigh espy'd,</br>With Bow in hand, and Arrows ready bent,</br>He by his former Combat would not bide,</br>But fled away with ghastly Dreriment,</br>Well knowing her to be his Death's sole Instrument.", "Whom seeing fly, she speedily pursu'd</br>With winged Feet, as nimble as the Wind;</br>And ever in her Bow she ready shew'd</br>The Arrow, to his deadly Mark design'd:</br>As when Latona's Daughter, cruel kind,</br>In Vengement of her Mother's great Disgrace,</br>With fell Despight her cruel Arrows tin'd</br>'Gainst woeful Niobe's unhappy Race,</br>That all the Gods did moan her miserable Case.", "So well she sped her, and so far she venter'd,</br>That e'er unto his hellish Den he raught,</br>Even as he ready was there to have enter'd,</br>She sent an Arrow forth with mighty Draught,</br>That in the very Door him over-caught,</br>And in his Nape arriving, thro it thrill'd</br>His greedy Throat, there-with in two distraught,</br>That all his vital Spirits thereby spill'd,</br>And all his hairy Breast with gory Blood was fill'd.", "Whom, when on ground she groveling saw to roll,</br>She ran in haste his Life to have bereft:</br>But e'er she could him reach, the sinful Soul,</br>Having his carion Corse quite sensless left,</br>Was fled to Hell, surcharg'd with Spoil and Theft.</br>Yet over him she there long gazing stood,</br>And oft admir'd his monstrous Shape, and eft</br>His mighty Limbs, whilst all with filthy Blood</br>The Place there overflown, seem'd like a sudden Flood.", "Thence-forth she past into his dreadful Den,</br>Where nought but darksom Dreriness she found,</br>Ne Creature saw, but harkned now and then</br>Some tattle Whisp'ring, and soft groaning Sound.</br>With that, she ask'd, what Ghosts there under ground</br>Lay hid in Horrour of eternal Night?</br>And bade them, if so be they were not bound,</br>To come and shew themselves before the Light,</br>Now freed from Fear and Danger of that dismal Wight.", "Then forth the sad Aemylia issu'd,</br>Yet trembling every Joint thro former Fear;</br>And after her the Hag, there with her mew'd,</br>A foul and loathsom Creature did appear;</br>A Leman fit for such a Lover dear.</br>That mov'd Belphoebe her no less to hate,</br>Than for to rue the other's heavy Chear;</br>Of whom she 'gan enquire of her Estate:</br>Who all to her at large, as happen'd, did relate.", "Thence she them brought, toward the place where late</br>She left the gentle Squire with Amoret:</br>There she him found by that new lovely Mate,</br>Who lay the whiles in Swoun, full sadly set,</br>From her fair Eyes wiping the dewy wet,</br>Which softly still'd, and kissing them atween,</br>And handling soft the Hurts which she did get.</br>For of that Carle she sorely bruis'd had been,</br>Als of his own rash Hand one Wound was to be seen.", "Which when she saw, with sudden glauncing Eye,</br>Her noble Heart with sight thereof was fill'd</br>With deep Disdain, and great Indignity,</br>That in her Wrath she thought them both have thrill'd</br>With that self Arrow, which the Carle had kill'd:</br>Yet held her wrathful Hand from Vengeance sore,</br>But drawing nigh, e'er he her well beheld;</br>Is this the Faith?  she said, and said no more,</br>But turn'd her Face, and fled away for evermore.", "He, seeing her depart, arose upright,</br>Right sore agrieved at her sharp Reproof,</br>And follow'd fast:  but when he came in sight,</br>He durst not nigh approach, but kept aloof,</br>For Dread of her Displeasure's utmost Proof.</br>And evermore, when he did Grace entreat,</br>And framed Speeches fit for his Behoof,</br>Her mortal Arrows she at him did threat,</br>And forc'd him back with foul Dishonour to retreat.", "At last, when long he follow'd had in vain,</br>Yet found no Ease of Grief, nor Hope of Grace,</br>Unto those Woods he turned back again,</br>Full of sad Anguish, and in heavy Case;</br>And finding there fit solitary Place</br>For woeful Wight, chose out a gloomy Glade,</br>Where hardly Eye mote see bright Heaven's Face</br>For mossy Trees, which cover'd all with Shade</br>And sad Melancholy:  there he his Cabin made.", "His wonted war-like Weapons all he broke,</br>And threw away, with vow to use no more,</br>Ne thenceforth ever strike in Battel Stroke,</br>Ne ever word to speak to Woman more;</br>But in that Wilderness (of Men forlore,</br>And of the wicked World forgotten quite)</br>His hard Mishap in Dolour to deplore,</br>And waste his wretched Days in woeful Plight;</br>So on himself to wreak his Folly's own Despight.", "And eke his Garment, to be there-to meet,</br>He wilfully did cut and shape anew;</br>And his fair Locks, that wont with Ointment sweet</br>To be embalm'd, and sweat out dainty Dew,</br>He let to grow, and griesly to concrew,</br>Uncomb'd, uncurl'd, and carelesly unshed;</br>That in short time his Face they over-grew,</br>And over all his Shoulders did dispred,</br>That who he whilom was, uneath was to be read.", "There he continu'd in this careful Plight,</br>Wretchedly wearing out his youthly Years,</br>Thro wilful Penury consumed quite,</br>That like a pined Ghost he soon appears.</br>For other Food than that wild Forest bears,</br>Ne other Drink there did be never taste</br>Than running Water, temper'd with his Tears,</br>The more his weaken'd Body so to waste;</br>That out of all Mens Knowledge he was worn at last.", "For on a day (by Fortune as it fell)</br>His own dear Lord Prince Arthur came that way,</br>Seeking Adventures where he mote hear tell;</br>And as he thro the wandring Wood did stray,</br>Having espy'd this Cabin far away,</br>He to it drew, to weet who there did wonne:</br>Weening therein some holy Hermit lay,</br>That did Resort of sinful People shun;</br>Or else some Wood-man shrouded there from scorching Sun.", "Arriving there, he found this wretched Man,</br>Spending his Days in Dolour and Despair;</br>And thro long fasting woxen pale and wan,</br>All over-grown with rude and rugged Hair;</br>That albeit his own dear Squire he were,</br>Yet he him knew not, ne aviz'd at all;</br>But like strange Wight, whom he had seen no where,</br>Saluting him, 'gan into Speech to fall,</br>And pity much his plight, that liv'd like out-cast Thrall.", "But to his Speech he aunswered no whit,</br>But stood still mute, as if he had been dumb,</br>Ne Sign of Sense did shew, ne common Wit,</br>As one with Grief and Anguish over-come,</br>And unto every thing did answer Mum:</br>And ever when the Prince unto him spake,</br>He louted lowly, as did him become,</br>And humble Homage did unto him make,</br>Midst Sorrow shewing joyous Semblance for his sake.", "At which his uncouth Guise and Usage quaint,</br>The Prince did wonder much, yet could not guess</br>The Cause of that his sorrowful Constraint;</br>Yet ween'd by secret Signs of Manliness,</br>Which close appear'd in that rude Brutishness,</br>That he whilom some gentle Swain had been,</br>Train'd up in Feats of Arms and Knightliness;</br>Which he observ'd, by that he him had seen</br>To wield his naked Sword, and try the Edges keen.", "And eke by that he saw on every Tree,</br>How he the Name of one engraver had,</br>Which likely was his liefest Love to be,</br>For whom he now so sorely was bestad;</br>Which was by him BELPHOEBE rightly rad.</br>Yet who was that Belphoebe, he ne wist;</br>Yet saw he often how he wexed glad,</br>When he it heard, and how the Ground he kiss'd,</br>Wherein it written was, and how himself he blist.", "Tho when he long had marked his Demeanor,</br>And saw that all he said and did, was vain,</br>Ne ought mote make him change his wonted Tenor,</br>Ne ought mote ease or mitigate his Pain,</br>He left him there in Langour to remain,</br>Till time for him should Remedy provide,</br>And him restore to former Grace again.</br>Which, for it is too long here to abide,</br>I will defer the End until another Tide.", ""]
