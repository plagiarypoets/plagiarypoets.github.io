Fight, and by his Arms were slain</br>Many brave Youths, and famous Chiefs of Spain.</br>But tho' the Gen'ral did such Courage show,</br>He could not from the Camp remove the Foe.</br>For prudent Mansfelt did with watchful Care,</br>Still with new Succours feed the fainting War.</br>Mauritius, who dispensing Orders stood,</br>And the sharp Strife, and bloody Labour view'd;</br>Who had perform'd a chief Commander's part,</br>With wary Wisdom, and applauded Art,</br>Rous'd his Brigades, and marching at their Head,</br>The Belgian Cohorts to the Combate led.</br>The Fight was doubtful, when the great Nassau</br>Did with a steddy Courage charge the Foe.</br>He plung'd amidst the Ranks, and certain Fate</br>Did the great Chief's victorious Weapons wait.</br>Unnumber'd Warriors did his Fury feel,</br>And in their Veins receiv'd the fatal Steel:</br>As raging Storms, which o'er the Mountains pass,</br>Lay flat the Forrests, and the Groves deface;</br>So did the Belgian, Mansfelt's Troops repel,</br>Before him so the slaughter'd Spaniards fell.</br>The Britons strengthen'd with the Belgian's Aid,</br>Did with new Fire th' Iberian Troops invade.</br>The noble Charge soon chang'd the doubtful Field,</br>The heartless Spaniard now began to yield.</br>They quit the Fight, and o'er th' Entrenchment run,</br>And leave the Briton's Camp, to gain their own.</br>Hard on the Reer the Briton's Tempest beat,</br>And gall'd them sore in their confus'd Retreat.", "The valiant Chiefs, the Vict'ry thus acquir'd,</br>Left the Pursuit, and to their Camp retir'd.</br>They Thanks to Heav'n with joyful Mind express,</br>That bless'd their Arms, and crown'd them with Success.</br>But O, how much their Pleasure did abate,</br>When first they heard of Alban's hapless Fate!</br>Greatly afflicted, sad Mauritius went,</br>Attended with the Chiefs, to Alban's Tent.</br>Where to their boundless Grief, the Gen'rals found</br>The noble Youth expiring of his Wound.</br>Each to his Tent with a sad Heart return'd,</br>Much valiant Vere's, much Britain's Loss they mourn'd.</br>Only Horatio with the Youth did stay,</br>The last dear Offices of Love to pay.", "Some Hours brave Alban agonizing lay,</br>His Strength declining by a swift Decay:</br>Cold Sweats, deep Sighs, short, interrupted Breath,</br>Sadly presag'd the near approach of Death.</br>The Sons of Art, ah fruitless Art!  stood by,</br>And look'd, as they too destin'd were to die.</br>His Heart its vital Labour scarce sustain'd,</br>And Life's dim Lamp a doubtful Flame maintain'd.</br>He with his Fate contended, but as soon</br>As Sable Night advanc'd, and reach'd her Noon,</br>The dying Youth fetch'd deep, redoubled Sighs,</br>And endless Night seal'd up his beauteous Eyes.</br>Thus did expire in sad Horatio's Arms,</br>Whatever War or Beauty have of Charms.</br>In part his Beauty did the Youth survive,</br>In part his Charms in Death remain'd alive.</br>So the gay Tulep, and the sweet Jonkyle,</br>Cut by the Gard'ner's unrelenting Steel,</br>Lie, gaudy Ruin, smiling on the Ground,</br>Still with their lovely Hue, and flow'ry Honours crown'd.</br>Mournful Horatio clos'd his Nephew's Eyes,</br>Bath'd him with Tears, and dry'd him with his Sighs.", "With Waters sweet, with odoriferous Gums,</br>Arabia's Drugs, and India's rich

laid.</br>With high rais'd Pillows, prop'd his lovely Head,</br>And o'er the Corps a Velvet Cov'ring spread.</br>Around the Bed his mournful Servants stood,</br>And Torrents from their Eyes of liquid Sorrow flow'd.</br>They seem'd forlorn, and hopeless of Relief,</br>Stupid with Woe, benumm'd and stiff with Grief.</br>So a young Deer, whose Front the sprouting Horn</br>With the first Velvet Honours does adorn,</br>Prais'd for his Beauty, for his Vigor fear'd,</br>At once the Pride and Envy of the Herd.</br>Ah!  hapless Fate!  by cruel Huntsmen slain,</br>Lies, lovely Victim, bleeding on the Plain.</br>So a young Cedar, whose conspicuous Head</br>The fragrant Groves on Mocha's Hills survey'd;</br>Which strait and tall, the present Glory stood,</br>The Hopes and promis'd Guardian of the Wood;</br>Fell'd by the Steels untimely Stroke descends,</br>And on the Ground his beauteous Limbs extends.", "Great Vere, who newly heard, that on the Main</br>Britannia's Ships had vanquish'd

who with mighty Sorrow was opprest,</br>His Eyes uplifted, struck his troubled Breast.</br>How did the Sadness of his Looks confess</br>His bitter Anguish, and his vast Distress?</br>The afflicted Father, with the Hero strove,</br>The firmest Courage, with the tend'rest Love.</br>But Love with Grief united won the Field,</br>And the soft Parent made the Warrior yield.</br>With Reason arm'd, he labour'd to arrest</br>And calm the Perturbations of his Breast.</br>But with unequal Arms for Conquest strove,</br>For Reason never was a Match for Love.</br>How did the Storm on Tides of Passion roll?</br>How did it urge, and agitate his Soul?</br>But tho' the swelling Tides so high did flow,</br>He did no unbecoming Passion show;</br>Just was his Grief, and decent was his Woe.</br>Some Hours this Stress of Sorrow did endure,</br>But languish'd by degrees, and lost its Pow'r.</br>Reason and grave Discourse are spent in vain</br>To ease our Suff'rings, and asswage our Pain.</br>Sick Minds must by degrees themselves restore,</br>Tis Time alone can mighty Trouble cure.", "His Passion's Tide subsiding, Vere at last</br>Some Questions ask'd about the Battel past.</br>To sooth his Sorrow, bad Horatio tell</br>Again how Alban fought, and how he fell.</br>Horatio more distinctly did relate</br>The Youth's great Actions, and unhappy Fate.</br>This done, the sad, afflicted Hero went,</br>Attended with his Chiefs, to Alban's Tent.</br>He saw his Son extended on the Bed,</br>His Cheeks defrauded of their native Red.</br>The tender Chief, (such all Great Heros are,)</br>Who was for Pity fram'd, as much as War,</br>At this sad Sight again began to melt,</br>And in his Breast his struggling Passion felt.</br>Alban's cold Lips the stooping Hero kist,</br>But then no longer could the Storm resist.</br>Within his lab'ring Heart, and yielding Breast,</br>The rising Father could not be supprest.</br>A Stream of Tears broke from his mournful Eyes,</br>And from his Bosom deep repeated Sighs.</br>The Chiefs around their great Affliction show,</br>And weep to see a Scene of so much Woe.</br>At last sad Vere, his Hand upon his Breast,</br>In moving Accents thus himself exprest.", "Ah Alban!  hapless Alban!  hapless Vere!</br>Ah heavy Woe!  too heavy Woe to bear!</br>Of the dear Object of my Eyes bereft,</br>Am I to Sorrow doom'd, to Woe despairing left?</br>There pale and breathless lies my Pride and Hope,</br>Of my declining Years the only Prop.</br>On Danger why did Alban rush so far?</br>Why did he seek such disproportion'd War?</br>More cautious Steps why did not Alban take,</br>Or for his own, or for his Father's sake?</br>Were not my Joy, my Hope, my All at Stake?</br>How much I wish the fatal Steel had mist</br>My Alban's, and had pierc'd the Father's Breast?</br>I would with Joy have chosen to resign</br>My Life, O Alban!  to have rescu'd thine.</br>But why my Sorrow do I tell in vain?</br>In fruitless Accents of my Fate complain?</br>Why do I Alban's youthful Conduct name?</br>Why cast on him of my Offence the Blame?</br>Too much on him for Comfort I rely'd,</br>Too much he was my Joy, too much my Pride.</br>Perhaps my Alban was to me too dear,</br>And Heav'n in Love will not a Rival bear.</br>Divine Religion does pronounce it fit,</br>I should my Will to that of Heav'n submit.</br>Th' Almighty's high Command I must obey,</br>And bear what Burdens he thinks fit to lay.</br>Eternal Truth and Justice cannot err,</br>Still is it Righteous, when 'tis most severe.</br>Shall I the universal Judge arraign?</br>Of Wisdom Infinite, and Sov'raign Pow'r complain?</br>I must adore the Government Divine,</br>What Heav'n is pleas'd to take, I must resign;</br>The high Decree is past, and Vere must not repine.", ""]
