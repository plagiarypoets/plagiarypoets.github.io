["Lest you should think that verse shall die,</br>Which sounds the Silver Thames along,</br>Taught on the wings of Truth, to fly</br>Above the reach of vulgar song;", "Tho' daring Milton sits Sublime,</br>In Spencer native Muses play;</br>Nor yet shall Waller yield to time,</br>Nor pensive Cowley's moral Lay&mdash;", "Sages and Chiefs long since had birth</br>E're Caesar was, or Newton nam'd,</br>These rais'd new Empires o'er the Earth,</br>And Those, new Heav'ns and Systems fram'd.", "Vain was the Chief's, and Sage's pride!</br>They had no Poet, and they dyd.</br>In vain they schem'd, in vain they bled!</br>They had no Poet, and are dead.</br>"]
