["Blushing Love, whose Eyes blue languish,</br>Sweetly timid, swept the Lyre;</br>Wak'd the Soul to pleasing Anguish,</br>Thrilling Throbs, and quick Desire.</br>From the Chords his flutt'ring Fingers,</br>Swift responsive to his Wishes,</br>Call forth Transports, Raptures, Blisses.</br>In slow, sad Strains the Minstrel lingers,</br>The solemn Airs, in mellower Cadence charm,</br>And the long Sounds hang on the list'ning Ear.</br>The Passions feel his various Power;</br>Hope beckons, Pity's Eye renews</br>The Tear; Joy knows one cheerless Hour;</br>Despair takes Breath, and Hope pursues.</br>No more Fear trembles; Anger stands compos'd;</br>Fain would Revenge arrest his lifted Arm;</br>And, from her Pangs dear Melancholy rous'd,</br>The pensive Smile of Patience seems to wear.</br>"]
