["Hither, O queen of silence, turn the steeds</br>The slow-pac'd steeds that draw thy ebon car,</br>And heave athwart the sky</br>Thy starry-studded veil.", "Come not with all thy horrors clad, thy heaps</br>Of threat'ning pitchy clouds, thy wasteful blasts</br>Which howling o'er the deep,</br>High swell the boisterous surge.", "Far be the fearful forms that round thee float!</br>The owl shrill-shrieking, and the flitting bat,</br>And every ghastly shape</br>That frighten'd fancy spies!", "But come with peaceful step, and o'er the land,</br>Parch'd by the sultry sun, thy coolness breathe,</br>And summer mists are shed</br>Upon the with'ring herb.", "Let all be still &mdash; save the sweet note of her</br>Who warbles to thy steps, and the faint sound</br>Of yon tall trees that bend</br>Before thy swelling breeze.", "Or from the distant mountain, whose huge crags</br>Are pil'd to heaven, let echo feebly send</br>The falling water's roar</br>Across the wide-spread lake.", "Then will I hasten to the firm-built tower,</br>And climb its winding steps, and from the top</br>Gaze with a deep delight</br>On heaven's bright-burning fires;", "While from the northern verge of ether shoot</br>The flickering tides of ever-changing light,</br>Now rolling yellow streams,</br>Now ting'd with glary red;", "Pleas'd will I trace the meteor of the vale,</br>Which, smoothly sliding thro' its shining path</br>Sinks in its swampy bed,</br>And dims its fires in mist:", "Descending 'midst the fields below I'll stray,</br>Where on the grass the quiet herds are stretch'd,</br>Mixing their fragrant breath</br>With freshen'd scents of flowers,", "Or loitering on the brim of ocean, mark</br>The pale beams dancing on its curled waves,</br>While from the gleamy east</br>The moon begins her course;", "Then slowly wandering to my peaceful home;</br>I'll seek my silent couch, and floating dreams</br>Shall feast my charmed soul</br>With airy scenes of bliss&mdash;</br>"]
