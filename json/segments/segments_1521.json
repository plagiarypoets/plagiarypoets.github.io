["Methinks I hear the band of saints above,</br>In holy anthem join'd, their voices raise</br>Tuning their golden harps to hymns of love,</br>While countless myriads swell the song of praise;</br>Descending sounds each flying zephyr seize,</br>Fill all the soften'd air, and float upon the breeze.", "Perhaps resigning ev'ry loftier strain,</br>Angels may seek to heal the wounded heart;</br>And condescending to a mortal's pain,</br>Those sweeter tones their sympathy impart.</br>Indulgent zephyr then the message bring,</br>O hither bend thy course, and swiftly spread thy wing.", "The charms of music yield to no controul,</br>Her soothing influence nothing shall destroy;</br>Some chord responsive vibrates in the soul,</br>And fills it with a soft, a pensive joy.</br>Each rougher feeling bends before her shrine,</br>Such everlasting power, sweet harmony, is thine.", "O strike again those strings, ye gales of heav'n,</br>Again describe time's fading, dying joys;</br>Why then has expectation falsely giv'n,</br>Those insubstantial views, which time destroys?</br>Soft messenger of peace, again pourtray</br>The fleeting hopes of time, the visions of life's day.", "From that sweet sound a secret pleasure springs,</br>Tho' still one sad resemblance I descry;</br>For as the breezes strike the trembling strings,</br>So hopes impress my soul, and so they die:</br>'Tis thus they bloom and fade, yet still I mourn,</br>Uncertain of their stay, or their return.", "But tho' the passing joys of time shall fade,</br>Tho' transient lustre decks our little day;</br>Tho' varied sorrows may our peace invade,</br>And hope may give its intermitting ray;</br>Yet the rich fruit of all these woes may be,</br>To fix our nobler views on immortality.</br>"]
