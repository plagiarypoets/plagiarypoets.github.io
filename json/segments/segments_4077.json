["Thy will be done, O King of Kings!</br>On Albion's banners sorrows wait,</br>Tho' fann'd by victory's glorious wings,</br>They wave in melancholy state!</br>Youth's bright helm, nor virtue's mail,</br>In thy dread visitations, can avail</br>To call a Seraph back from Heavenly spheres&mdash;</br>Not Albion's prayers &mdash; not Albion's tears!</br>Thus flow the strains, that o'er the rising pride</br>Of England's Prince spread sorrow and dismay;</br>As up the steep of power and empire wide,</br>He winds with filial awe his bright array;</br>Lo!  Clarence tranc'd in speechless grief appears,</br>York drops his glittering lance, dissolv'd in generous tears!</br>"]
