["Hope, sweetest child of Fancy born,</br>Tho' transient as the dew of morn,</br>Thou who canst charm, with sound and light,</br>The deafen'd ear, and darken'd sight,</br>And in dry deserts glad the swains</br>With bubbling springs, and cultur'd plains;</br>No more invent thy airy schemes,</br>Nor mock me with fantastic dreams;</br>No more thy flattering stories tell,</br>Deceitful prattler, Hope, farewell!", "Adieu the pleasing prospect, plann'd</br>By Fancy's fair delusive hand!</br>No more that momentary ray,</br>Which gilds by fits a showery day,</br>Shall show me, in a distant grove,</br>Health, friendship, peace, content and love;</br>While many a nymph, and many a youth,</br>By Hymen join'd, and crown'd  by Truth,</br>On verdant hillocks danc'd and play'd,</br>Or warbled in the hawthorn shade.", "No more, with sweet endearing talk,</br>Shalt thou beguile my vernal walk;</br>No more, as thro' the wintry vale,</br>We journey on, with many a tale</br>Of fancied pleasure, cheer the day,</br>And strow with flowers the rugged way,</br>Still pointing to that rural cell</br>Where Innocence and Stella dwell;</br>Charm with the bubbling of a rill,</br>That gushes from the neighbouring hill.", "O let me now in silence rove</br>Thro' yon sequester'd cypress grove,</br>Where, crown'd with leaves of baleful yew,</br>And circled by a Stygian crew,</br>(When, from the ivy-mantled tower,</br>The cock proclaims the midnight hour)</br>Pale Melancholy takes her round,</br>And o'er the mouldering, hallow'd ground</br>Where lovers lie, desponding stands,</br>And, dumb with pity, wrings her hands.", "While thus, with gloomy thoughts opprest,</br>Heart-piercing sorrow heav'd my breast,</br>A heavenly form swift gliding by,</br>With healing comfort in her eye,</br>A look of winning softness cast,</br>And thus addrest me as she past:</br>\"Mortal, be wise!  and, even in death,</br>Let Hope receive thy parting breath!</br>Securely trust my guardian care,</br>And, led by Reason, shun Despair.\"</br>"]
