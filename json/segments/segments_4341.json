["How languid and dull is my lay,</br>How gloomy and sad is my mind,</br>No pleasures my grief can allay,</br>Since Phillis proves false and unkind.", "How faded appears the fresh green,</br>How dreary's the landscape to view,</br>And all seems a desolate scene,</br>Since Phillida's bid me adieu.", "Her beauties enraptur'd my theme</br>With joy so extatick, that I</br>Could for ever have dwelt on the strain,</br>Had the fair one but deign'd to stand by.", "Her presence enliven'd my flock,</br>And shade them all sportively gay,</br>But since she's their Damon forgot,</br>Alas!  they're all wander'd astray.", "Nor do them, ye shepherds, e'er seek,</br>But let them dejectedly rove,</br>And haste to your Damon and weep,</br>For Phillis hath slighted his love.", "And all ye fair nymphs of the grove,</br>Come join with lost Damon, forlorn,</br>To wail and bemoan, for his love</br>Hath repaid his addresses with scorn.", "Your pastimes no more can invite</br>My presence, to blend in the throng,</br>Nor can the sweet wood-larks delight</br>Mine ear, to attend to their song.", "And when I retire to the shade,</br>Where myrtles and amaranths grow,</br>Where first I beheld the fair maid,</br>It only increaseth my woe.", "Oh!  would she but kindly approve</br>The passion that glows in my breast,</br>With purity, friendship, and love,</br>I then should be happily blest.", "My time then unclouded wou'd roll</br>With pleasure delightful away,</br>And Phillis, the wish of my soul,</br>Wou'd heighten the bliss of each day.</br>"]
