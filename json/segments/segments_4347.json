["Ah!  why should the nymph who enslaves</br>My heart, be thus deaf to my moans?</br>She heeds not, though rocks, woods and caves</br>I tire, to death, with my groans.", "Have I not, as a shepherd became,</br>Declar'd to that dearest of dears,</br>That my bosom was all in a flame,</br>Which I could not put out with my tears?", "Have I not with those tears swell'd each stream,</br>To shew the excess of my sorrow?</br>Have I not said that life was a dream,</br>Which scarcely could last 'till to-morrow?", "Have I not said, my heart by her eyes</br>Was mangled and torn till it bled?</br>And though she might still hear my sighs,</br>I was truly and honestly dead?", "That wolves at her song grow quite tame?</br>That rivers flow back to their sources?</br>That each forest and rock you can name,</br>Rejoices whene'er she discourses?", "And though in our forests no lark</br>Or nightingale e'er spread his wings,</br>Have I not, when I heard her, cried \"hark!</br>'Tis a lark or a nightingale sings!\"", "Have I not cried alack!  and alas!</br>By a sweet purling streamlet a lying,</br>And she look'd, and she sigh'd, I may say,</br>All as one just as if she was dying;", "Didn't I help her so gently to rise?</br>Though softly she whisper'd no, no!</br>And blush'd! &mdash; I could tell by her eyes,</br>That she wanted her shepherd to go.", "Ah me!  while her heart's such a rock,</br>For swains with their pipes, a whole throng,</br>And for gout-footed Pan a whole flock,</br>I'd not give, ye shepherds, a song!</br>"]
