["Come, gentle Pow'r, from whom arose</br>Whate'er life's chequer'd scenes adorns;</br>From whom the living current flows</br>Whence Science fills her various urns:</br>Sacred to Thee, yon Marble dome,</br>O Goddess, rears it's awful head,</br>Fraught with the stores of Greece and Rome,</br>With gold, and glowing gems inlaid,</br>Where Art by thy command hath fixt her seat,</br>And ev'ry Muse, and ev'ry Grace retreat.", "For erst Mankind, a savage Race,</br>As lawless Robbers rang'd the woods,</br>And chose, when weary'd with the chace,</br>'Midst rocks, and caves, their dark abodes;</br>'Till Friendship, thy persuasive strains,</br>Pow'rful as Orpheus' magic song,</br>Re-echo'd thro' the squalid plains</br>And drew the brutish herd along:</br>Lost in surprize thy pleasing voice they own'd,</br>Chose softer arts, and polisht at the sound.", "Then Pity first her sacred flame</br>Within their frozen bosoms rais'd;</br>Tho' faint the spark, when Friendship came,</br>When Friendship wav'd her wing it blaz'd.</br>'Twas then first heav'd the social socials sigh,</br>The social tear began to flow,</br>They felt a sympathetic joy,</br>And learnt to melt at others' woe:</br>By just degrees Humanity refin'd;</br>And Virtue fixt her empire in the mind.", "O Goddess, when thy form appears,</br>Revenge and Rage, and Faction cease,</br>The soul no Fury-Passion tears,</br>But all is harmony, and peace.</br>Aghast the purple Tyrant stood,</br>With awe beheld thy glowing charms,</br>Forgot the cursed thirst of blood,</br>And long'd to grasp thee in his arms;</br>Felt in his breast unusual softness rise,</br>And, deaf before, heard Pity's moving cries.", "Is there a Wretch in Sorrow's shade,</br>Who wastes in tears Life's ling'ring hours?</br>Is there, on whose devoted head </br>Her vengeful curses Ate pours?</br>See to their aid fair Friendship flies,</br>Their sorrows sympathetic feels,</br>With lenient hand her balm applies,</br>And ev'ry grief indulgent heals:</br>The woe-fraught Fiends before her stalk away,</br>As Spectres shun the flaming eye of day.", "Oh for a faithful, honest Friend,</br>To whom I ev'ry care could trust,</br>Each weakness of my soul commend,</br>Nor fear him treach'rous, or unjust!</br>Drive Flatt'ry's Summer-train away.</br>Those busy, curious, flutt'ring things,</br>That insect-like, in Fortune's ray,</br>Bask, and expand their gaudy wings:</br>But ah when once the transient gleam is o'er,</br>Behold the change! &mdash; They die, and are no more.</br>"]
