["Hence to thy darkest shades, dire Slavery, hence!</br>Thine icy touch can freeze,</br>Swift as the Polar breeze</br>The proud defying port of human sense.</br>Hence to thine Indian cave,</br>To where the tall canes whisper o'er thy rest,</br>Like the murmuring wave</br>Swept by the dank wing of the rapid west:</br>And at the night's still noon,</br>The lash'd Angolan, in his grated cell,</br>Mix'd with the tyger's yell,</br>Howls to the dull ear of the silent moon.", "But come, thou goddess, blithe and free,</br>Thou mountain-maid, sweet Liberty!</br>With buskin'd knee, and bosom bare,</br>Thy tresses floating in the air:</br>Come, &mdash; and treading on thy feet,</br>Independence let me meet,</br>Thy giant mate, whose awful form</br>Has often braved the bellowing storm;</br>And heard its angry spirit shriek,</br>Rear'd on some promontory's beak,</br>Seen by the lonely fisher far,</br>By the glimpse of flitting star.</br>His awful bulk, in dusky shrowd,</br>Commixing with the pitchy cloud;</br>While at his feet the lightnings play,</br>And the deep thunders die away.</br>Goddess, come, and let us sail</br>On the fresh reviving gale;</br>O'er dewy lawns, and forests lone,</br>'Till lightning on some mountain stone,</br>That scales the circumambient sky,</br>We see a thousand nations lie.</br>From Zembla's snows, to Afric's heat,</br>Prostrate beneath our frolic feet.", "From Italy's luxurious plains,</br>Where everlasting summer reigns,</br>Why Goddess, dost thou turn away?</br>Didst thou never sojourn there?</br>Oh, yes, thou didst &mdash; but fallen is Rome,</br>The pilgrim weeps her silent doom.</br>As at midnight, murmuring low,</br>Along the mouldering portico,</br>He hears the desolate wind career,</br>While the rank  ivy whispers near.", "Ill-fated Gaul!  ambitious grasp</br>Bids thee again in slavery gasp.</br>Again the dungeon walls resound</br>The hopeless shriek, the groan profound.</br>But, lo, in yonder happy skies,</br>Helvetia's airy mountains rise,</br>And, oh, on her tall cliffs reclin'd,</br>Gay fancy, whispering to the mind:</br>As the wild herdsman's call is heard,</br>Tells me, that she, o'er all preferr'd</br>In every clime, in every zone,</br>Is Liberty's divinest throne.</br>Yet, whence that sigh?  O goddess, say,</br>Has the tyrant's thirsty sway</br>Dared profane the sacred seat,</br>Thy long high-favour'd, best retreat?</br>It has!  it has!  away, away,</br>To where the green isles woo the day,</br>Where thou art still supreme, and where</br>Thy Paeans fill the floating air.</br>"]
