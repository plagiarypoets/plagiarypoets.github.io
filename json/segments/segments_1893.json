["When crafty Daedalus, thro' the realms of light,</br>Fearless, confiding in his peerless art,</br>O'er cloud-topt mountains bent his lofty flight,</br>And bade the aery billows yielding part;</br>Swiftly and safe he soared, nor aught he cared</br>What humble mortals thought, how creeping reptiles stared.", "Thus, with poetic genius and fire,</br>On Fancy's pinions, high above the skies,</br>We see Lord Byron's sonorous muse aspire,</br>While petty insect-scribblers he defies;</br>They burn with envy, burst with eunuch spite,</br>And, as they cannot match, attempt t' arraign his flight.", "In vain they 'tempt, for, in ethereal strains,</br>The bard records what angels might peruse;</br>Seraphic ardour fills his swelling veins,</br>Themselves admire, who boldly dare accuse.</br>But careless he what reptiles think below,</br>Bids higher, bolder still his deathless accents flow.</br>"]
