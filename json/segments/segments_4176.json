["When ev'ning beam'd over the mead,</br>And the sun o'er the western main</br>His lustre auriferous spread,</br>And the shepherds sung sweet on the plain;</br>On the banks of a rivulet met,</br>Where willows wave gently along,</br>Young PHYLLIS transportingly sweet,</br>And DAMON both sprightly and young.", "Their converse was free and sincere,</br>Simplicity heightens each grace;</br>He assumes no unnatural air,</br>And no patches spoil her sweet face.</br>Of the lilies that border the lake,</br>And the flowerets that bloom by the rill,</br>He a nosegay for Phyllis did make;</br>And she sung him \"the lass of the mill.\"", "He praised the sweet warbling voice,</br>Surpassing the nightingale's lay:</br>How happy's the swain that's your choice!</br>With transport he happen'd to say.</br>The roses blush'd fresh in her cheek,</br>And sweetness beam'd bright in her eye;</br>Each gesture was modest and meek;</br>From her breast rose a soft-heaving sigh.", "Then Damon, with fondest delight,</br>Remarking these tokens of love,</br>Embrac'd her.  From Ida's fair height,</br>'Twas declared approven above.</br>Since that time they constantly meet</br>At even on the bank of the flood,</br>Or close by the oak-tree they sit,</br>That grows on the streams in the wood.</br>"]
