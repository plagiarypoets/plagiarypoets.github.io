["When civil Dudgeon first grew high,</br>And men fell out they knew not why;</br>When hard words, Jealousies and Fears,</br>Set Folks together by the ears,</br>And made them fight, like mad or drunk,</br>For Dame Religion as for Punk,</br>Whose honesty they all durst swear for,</br>Though not a man of them knew wherefore:</br>When Gospel-trumpeter, surrounded</br>With long-ear'd rout, to Battel sounded,</br>And Pulpit, Drum Ecclesiastick,</br>Was beat with fist, instead of a stick:</br>Then did Sir Knight abandon dwelling,</br>And out he rode Colonelling.", "A wight he was, whose very sight wou'd</br>Entitle him Mirrour of Knighthood;</br>That never bow'd his stubborn knee</br>To any thing but Chivalry,</br>Nor put up blow, but that which laid</br>Right Worshipfull on shoulder-blade:</br>Chief of Domestick Knights and Errant,</br>Either for Chastel or for Warrant:</br>Great on the Bench, Great in the Saddle,</br>That could as well bind o'er, as swaddle:</br>Mighty he was at both of these,</br>And styl'd of War as well as Peace.</br>(So some Rats of amphibious nature,</br>Are either for the Land or Water.)</br>But here our Authors make a doubt,</br>Whether he were more wise, or stout.</br>Some hold the one, and some the other:</br>But howsoe'er they make a pother,</br>The difference was so small, his Brain</br>Outweigh'd his Rage but half a grain:</br>Which made some take him for a tool</br>That Knaves do work with, call'd a Fool.</br>For't has been held by many, that</br>As Mountaigne, playing with his Cat,</br>Complaines she thought him but an Ass,</br>Much more she would Sir Hudibras.</br>But they're mistaken very much,</br>'Tis plain enough he was no such.</br>We grant, although he had much wit,</br>H' was very shie of using it,</br>As being loath to wear it out,</br>And therefore bore it not about,</br>Unless on Holy-dayes, or so,</br>As men their best Apparel do.</br>Beside 'tis known he could speak Greek,</br>As naturally as Pigs squeek:</br>That Latin was no more difficile,</br>Then to a Blackbird 'tis to whistle.</br>Being rich in both he never scanted</br>His Bounty unto such as wanted;</br>But much of either would afford</br>To many that had not one word.</br>For Hebrew Roots, although th' are found</br>To flourish most in barren ground,</br>He had such plenty, as suffic'd</br>To make some think him circumcis'd:</br>And truly so he was perhaps,</br>Not as a Proselyte, but for Claps.", "He was in Logick a great Critick,</br>Profoundly skill'd in Analytick.</br>He could distinguish, and divide</br>A hair 'twixt South and South-west side:</br>On either which he would dispute,</br>Confute, change hands, and still confute.</br>He'd undertake to prove by force</br>Of Argument, a Man's no Horse.</br>He'd prove a Buzzard is no Fowl,</br>And that a Lord may be an Owl;</br>A Calf an Alderman, a Goose a Justice,</br>And Rooks Committee-men and Trustees.</br>He'd run in Debt by Disposition,</br>And pay with Ratiocination.</br>All this by Syllogism, true</br>In mood and figure, he would doe.", "For Rhetorick, he could not ope</br>His mouth, but out there flew a Trope:</br>And when he hapned to break off</br>I' th' middle of his speech, or cough,</br>H' had hard words ready, to shew why,</br>And tell what Rules he did it by.</br>Else when with greatest Art he spoke,</br>You'd think he talk'd like other foke.</br>But when he pleas'd to shew't, his speech</br>In loftiness of sound was rich,</br>A Babylonish dialect,</br>Which learned Pedants much affect.</br>It was a particolour'd dress</br>Of patch'd and pyball'd Languages:</br>'Twas English cut on Greek and Latin,</br>Like Fustian heretofore on Sattin.</br>It had an odde promiscuous Tone,</br>As if h' had talk'd three parts in one.</br>Which made some think, when he did gabble,</br>Th' had heard three Labourers of Babel;</br>Or Cerberus himself pronounce</br>A Leash of Languages at once.</br>This he as volubly would vent,</br>As if his stock would ne'er be spent.</br>And truly to support that charge</br>He had supplies as vast and large.</br>For he could coyn or counterfeit</br>New words, with little or no wit:</br>Words so debas'd and hard, no stone</br>Was hard enough to touch them on.</br>And when with hasty noise he spoke 'em,</br>The Ignorant for currant took 'em.", "In Mathematicks he was greater</br>Then Tycho Brahe or Erra Pater:</br>For he by Geometrick scale</br>Could take the size of Pots of Ale;</br>Resolve by Sines and Tangents straight,</br>If Bread or Butter wanted weight;</br>And wisely tell what hour o' th' day</br>The Clock does strike, by Algebra.", "Beside he was a shrewd Philosopher,</br>And had read every Text and gloss over:</br>What ever Sceptick could inquire for;</br>For every why he had a wherefore:</br>Knew more then forty of them do,</br>As far as words and termes could goe.</br>All which he understood by Rote,</br>And as occasion serv'd, would quote;</br>No matter whether right or wrong:</br>They might be either said or sung.</br>His Notions fitted things so well,</br>That which was which he could not tell;</br>But oftentimes mistook the one</br>For th' other, as Great Clerks have done.</br>He'd tell where Entity and Quiddity,</br>The Ghosts of defunct Bodies, flie;</br>Where Truth in Person does appear,</br>Like words congeal'd in Northern Air.</br>He knew what's what, and that's as high</br>As Metaphysick wit can flie.</br>In School-Divinity as able</br>As he that hight Irrefrangable;</br>A second Thomas, or, at once</br>To name them all, another Dunce.</br>For he a Rope of sand could twist,</br>As tough as learned Sorbonist;</br>And weave fine Cobwebs, fit for skull</br>That's empty when the Moon is full;</br>Such as take lodgings in a Head</br>That's to be let unfurnished.</br>He could raise Scruples dark and nice,</br>And after solve 'em in a trice:</br>As if Divinity had catch'd</br>The Itch, of purpose to be scratch'd;</br>Or, like a Mountebank, did wound</br>And stab her self with doubts profound,</br>Onely to shew with how small pain</br>The sores of faith are cur'd again;</br>Although by woful proof we find,</br>They alwayes leave a Scar behind.</br>He knew the seat of Paradise,</br>Could tell in what degree it lies:</br>What Adam dreamt of when his Bride</br>Came from her Closet in his side:</br>Whether the Devil tempted her</br>By a high Dutch Interpreter:</br>If either of them had a Navel;</br>Who first made Musick malleable:</br>Whether the Serpent at the Fall</br>Had cloven Feet, or none at all.</br>All this, without a Gloss or Comment,</br>He would unriddle in a moment</br>In proper terms, such as men smatter</br>When they throw out and miss the matter.", "For his Religion it was fit</br>To match his Learning and his Wit:</br>'Twas Presbyterian true blew,</br>For he was of that stubborn Crew</br>Of Errant Saints, whom all men grant</br>To be the true Church Militant:</br>Such as do build their Faith upon</br>The holy Text of Pike and Gun;</br>Decide all Controversies by</br>Infallible Artillery;</br>And prove their Doctrine Orthodox</br>By Apostolick Blows and Knocks;</br>Call Fire and Sword and Desolation,</br>A godly-thorough-Reformation,</br>Which alwayes must be carry'd on,</br>And still be doing, never done:</br>As if Religion were intended</br>For nothing else but to be mended.</br>A Sect, whose chief Devotion lies</br>In odde perverse Antipathies;</br>In falling out with that or this,</br>And finding somewhat still amiss:</br>More peevish, cross, and spleenatick,</br>Then Dog distract, or Monky sick:</br>That with more care keep holy-day</br>The wrong, then others the right way:</br>Still so perverse and opposite,</br>As if they worshipp'd God for spight.</br>The self-same thing they will abhor</br>One way, and long another for.</br>Free-will they one way disavow,</br>Another, nothing else alow.</br>All Piety consists therein</br>In them, in other men all Sin.</br>Rather than faile, they will defie</br>That which they love most tenderly,</br>Quarrel with minc'd Pies, and disparage</br>Their best and dearest friend, Plum-porredge;</br>Fat Pig and Goose it self oppose,</br>And blaspheme Custard through the nose.</br>Th' Apostles of this fierce Religion,</br>Like Mahomet's, were Ass and Widgeon,</br>To whom our Knight by fast instinct</br>Of wit and temper was so linkt,</br>As if Hypocrisie and non-sense</br>Had got th' Advousion of his Conscience.", "Thus was he gifted and accouter'd,</br>We mean on th' inside, not the outward:</br>That next of all we shall discuss;</br>Then listen, Sirs, It followeth thus....</br>"]
