["Child of the light, fair morning hour,</br>Who smilest o'er yon purple hill!</br>I come to woo thy cheering pow'r,</br>Beside this murm'ring rill.</br>Nor I alone &mdash; a thousand songsters rise</br>To meet thy dawning, and thy sweets to share;</br>While ev'ry flow'r that scents the honied air,</br>Thy milder influence feels, and sheds its brightest dies.", "And let me hear some village swain</br>Whistle in rustic glee along;</br>Or hear some true love's gentle pain</br>Breath'd from the milkmaid's song.</br>Wild are those notes, but sweeter far to me</br>Than the soft airs borne from Italian groves:</br>To which the wanton muse and naked loves</br>Strike the wild lyre, and dance in gamesome glee.", "And rosy health, for whom so long</br>Mid sleepless nights I've sigh'd in vain,</br>Shall throw her airy vestment on,</br>And meet me on the plain.</br>Gay laughing nymph, that loves a morning sky;</br>That loves to trip across the spangled dews;</br>And with her finger dipp'd in brightest hues,</br>My faint cheek shall she tinge, and cheer my languid eye.", "Then will I taste the morn's sweet hour,</br>And, singing, bless the new-born day;</br>Or, wand'ring in Amanda's bow'r,</br>Rifle the sweets of May:</br>And to my song Amanda shall attend,</br>And take the posie from the sylvan muse;</br>For sure the virtuous fair will not refuse</br>The muse's modest gifts, her tribute to a friend.</br>"]
