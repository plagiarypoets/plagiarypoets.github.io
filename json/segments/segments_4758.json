["Come, shepherds, bewail my sad fate,</br>You know not how wretched I am;</br>My ewes seek in vain for a mate,</br>And next year I shall not have a lamb.", "Yet this I could suffer unmov'd,</br>If Phillis but kindly would look;</br>If she softly would whisper she lov'd,</br>I'd give both my pipe and my crook.", "Oh!  have I not cause for despair?</br>No zephyr my passion can cool!</br>For Phillis (ah, too cruel fair!)</br>False Phillis declares I'm a fool.</br>"]
