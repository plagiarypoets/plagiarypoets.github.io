Orange trees which golden fruit doe bear,</br>Th' Hesperian garden boasts of none so fair?</br>Where shining pearle, corall, and many a pound</br>On the rich shore, of Amber-greece is found:</br>The lofty Cedar which to heaven aspires,</br>The Prince of trees is fewell for their fires:</br>The smoak by which their loaded spits do turne</br>For incense, might on sacred Altars burn.</br>There private roofs on od'rous timber borne,</br>Such as might Pallaces for Kings adorne:</br>The sweet Palmettas, a new Bacchus yeeld</br>With leaves as ample as the broadest shield:</br>Under the shadow of whose friendly boughs</br>They sit carrowsing, where their liquor grows:</br>Figs there unplanted through the fields doe grow,</br>Such as fierce Cato did the Romans shew;</br>With the rare fruit inviting them to spoyle,</br>Carthage the mistris of so rich a soyle:</br>The naked rocks are not unfruitful there,</br>But at some constant seasons every year:</br>Their barren top with loucious food abound,</br>And with the egges of various fowles are crown'd:</br>Tobacco is their worst of things which they</br>To English Land-lords as their Tribute pay:</br>Such is the mould, that the blest Tennant feeds</br>On pretious fruits, and payes his rent in weeds:</br>With candid plantines and the jucy Pine,</br>On choicest Melons and sweet Grapes they dine,</br>And with Potato's fat their wanton Swine:</br>Nature these Cates with such a lavish hand</br>Powres out among them, that our courser Land</br>Tastes of that bounty, and does Cloth return,</br>Which not for warmth, but ornament is worne:</br>For the kinde Spring which but salutes us here</br>Inhabits there, and courts them all the year:</br>Ripe fruits and blossomes, on the same trees live,</br>At once they promise what at once they give:</br>So sweet the aire, so moderate the clime,</br>None sickly lives, or dyes before his time.</br>Heaven sure has kept this spot of earth uncurst</br>To shew how all things were created first:</br>The tardy plants in our cold Orchards plac't,</br>Reserve their fruits for the next ages taste:</br>There a small graine in some few months will be</br>A firme, a lofty, and a spacious tree:</br>The Parmachristi, and the fair Papah,</br>Now but a seed (preventing natures law)</br>In halfe the circle of the hasty year</br>Project a shade, and lovely fruit doe wear:</br>And as their trees in our dull Region set</br>But faintly grow, and no perfection get:</br>So in this Northerne tract our hoarser throats</br>Utter unripe and ill constrained notes,</br>Where the supporter of the Poets stile,</br>Phoebus on them eternally does smile.</br>O how I long my carelesse limbs to lay</br>Under the plantanes shade, and all the day</br>With am'rous eyes my fancy entertaine,</br>Invoke the Muses, and improve my veine:</br>No passion there in my free breasts should move,</br>None but the sweet and best of passions love:</br>There while I sing if gentle love be by</br>That tunes my lute, and winds the strings so high:</br>With the sweet sound of Sacharissa's name,</br>He make the listning salvages grow tame.</br>But while I doe these pleasing dreams

well thy may the num'rous Turk despise;</br>Yet is no humane fate exempt from fear</br>Which shakes their hearts, while through the Ile they hear</br>A lasting noise, as horrid and as loud</br>As thunder makes before it breaks the cloud.</br>Three dayes they dread this murmur ere they know</br>From what blind cause th' unwonted sound may grow.</br>At length two monsters of unequall size</br>Hard by the shore a fisher man espies;</br>Two mighty Whales, which swellings Seas has tost,</br>And left them prisoners on the rocky coast;</br>One as a mountaine vast, and with her came</br>A Cub not much inferior to his Dam:</br>Here in a poole among the Rocks ingag'd,</br>They roar'd like Lions caught in toyles and rag'd:</br>The man knew what they were, who heretofore</br>Had seen the like lye murdered on the shore,</br>By the wild fury of some tempest cast</br>The fate of ships and shipwrackt men to taste;</br>As carelesse dames whom wine and sleep betray</br>To frantick dreams their Infants overlay:</br>So there sometime the raging Ocean sailes,</br>And her owne brood exposes when the Whales</br>Against sharpe Rocks like reeling vessels quash't,</br>Though huge as mountains, are in peeces dash't;</br>Along the shore their dreadfull limbs lye scatter'd,</br>Like hills with earthquakes shaken, torn and shatter'd:</br>Heart sure of brasse they had who tempted first,</br>Rude Seas that spare not what themselves have nurst.", "The welcome news through all the Nation spread,</br>To sudden joy and hope converts their dread.</br>What lately was their publique terror, they</br>Behold with glad eyes as a certaine prey;</br>Dispose already of th' untaken spoyle,</br>And as if purchase of their future toyle,</br>These share the bones and they divide the oyle:</br>So was the Hunts man by the Bear opprest,</br>Whose hide he sold before he caught the beast.", "They man their Boasts, and all their young men arm</br>With whatsoever may the Monsters harme;</br>Pikes, holberts, spits and darts, that wound so far</br>The tools of peace, and instruments of war:</br>Now as the time for vigrous lads to shew</br>What love or honour could invite them too;</br>A goodly Theatre where rocks are round</br>With reverend age, and lovely lasses crown'd:</br>Such was the lake which held this dreadfull pare</br>Within the bounds of noble Warwicks share:</br>Warwicks bold Earle, then which no title bears</br>A greater found among our Brittish Peers;</br>And worthy he the memory to renew</br>The fate and honour, to that title due;</br>Whose brave adventures have transferr'd his name,</br>And through the new world spread his growing fame.</br>But how they fought, and what their valour gain'd,</br>Shall in another Canto be contain'd.", "</br>CANTO III.</br>The bloudy fight, succeslesse toyle,</br>And how the Fish sack'd the Isle.", "The boat which on the first assault did goe</br>Stroke with a harping Iron the younger foe;</br>Who when he felt his side so rudely goar'd</br>Loud as the Seas that nourish'd him he roar'd;</br>As a broad bream to please some curious taste,</br>While yet alive in boyling water cast;</br>Vex't with unwonted heat, boyles, flings about</br>The scorching brasse, and hurles the liquor out:</br>So with the barbed Javeling stung, he raves,</br>And scourges with his tayle the suffering waves;</br>Like fairy Talus with his iron flayle,</br>He threatens ruine with his pondrous tayle;</br>Dissolving at one stroak the battered Boat,</br>And downe the men fall drenched in the moat:</br>With every fierce encounter they are forc't</br>To quit their boats, and fare like men unhorst.", "The bigger Whale like some huge Carrack lay,</br>Which wanteth Sea roome, with her foes to play;</br>Slowly she swims, and when provok'd she woud</br>Advance her tail, her head salutes the mud.</br>The shallow water doth her force infringe,</br>And renders vaine her tails impetuous swinge.</br>The shining steele her tender sides receive,</br>And there like Bees they all their weapons leave.", "This sees the Cub, and does himself oppose</br>Betwixt his cumbred mother and her foes:</br>With desperate courage he receives her wounds,</br>And men and boats his active tayl confounds.</br>Their surges joyn'd, the Seas with billows fill,</br>And make a tempest, though the winds be still.", "Now would the men with half their hoped prey</br>Be well content, and wish this cub away:</br>Their wish they have, he to direct his dam</br>Unto the gap through which they thither came,</br>Before her swains, and quits the hostile lake,</br>A pris'ner there, but for his mothers sake.</br>She by the Rocks compell'd to stay behind,</br>Is by the vastnesse of her bulks confin'd.</br>They shout for joy, and now on her alone</br>Their furie fals, and all their darts are thrown:</br>Their launces spent; one bolder than the rest</br>With his broad sword provok'd the sluggish beast:</br>Her oyly side devours blade and heft,</br>And there his Steel the bold Bermudian left.</br>Courage the rest from his example take,</br>And now they change the colour of the lake.</br>Blood flows in rivers from her wounded side,</br>As if they would prevent the tardie tide;</br>And raise the flood to that propitious height,</br>As might convey her from this fatall streight.</br>She swims in blood, and blood do's spouting throw</br>To heaven, that Heaven mens cruelties might know.</br>Their fixed javelings in her side she weares,</br>And on her back a grove of pikes appears.</br>You would have thought had you the monster seen</br>Thus drest, she had another Island been:</br>Roaring she teares the ayre with such noise,</br>(As well resembled with conspiring voice</br>Of routed Armies, when the field is won)</br>To reach the ears of her escaped son.</br>He (though a league escaped the foe)</br>Hasts to her aid, the pious Trojan so</br>Neglecting for Creusas life his own,</br>Repeats the danger of the burning Town,</br>The men amazed blush to see the seed</br>Of monsters, humane pietie exceed,</br>Well proves the kindnesse what the Grecians sung,</br>That loves bright mother from the Ocean sprung.</br>Their courage droops, and hopelesse now they wish</br>For composition with th' unconquer'd fish:</br>So she their weapons would restore again,</br>Through rocks they'd hew her passage to the main.</br>But how instructed in each others mind,</br>Or what commerce can men with monsters find.</br>Not daring to approach their wounded fo,</br>Whom her couragious son protected so:</br>They charge their musket, and with hot desire</br>Standing aloofe with lead, they bruise the scales,</br>And tare the flesh of the incensed Whales.</br>But no successe their fierce endeavours found,</br>Nor this way could they give one fatall wound.</br>Now to their Fort they are about to send</br>For the loud Engines which their Isle defend.</br>But what those peices fram'd to batter walls</br>Would have effected on those mighty Whales,</br>Great Neptune will not have us know, who finds</br>A tyde so high that it relieves his friends.</br>And thus they parted with exchange of harms,</br>Much blood the Monsters lost, and they their Arms.</br>"]
