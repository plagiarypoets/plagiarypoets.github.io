["The Grove, when Cibber, violating trode,</br>Night fell, and gloom'd the Muses' green abode,</br>With rumbling notes the rumbling echoes  ring</br>Each Muse affrighted, clos'd her secret spring.</br>But sudden, o'er the fading clouds of night,</br>The day-spring stream'd its animating light;</br>Soft notes from Castaly's fair bowers were flung;</br>The Muses listen'd as their Whitehead sung.</br>Warton, collecting every burning ray,</br>Mounts high, and pours a blazing noon of day.</br>His Gothic grandeur won the musing train,</br>And Spenser, smiling, lov'd his own sweet strain.</br>Now breaks a milder beam, more soft, more fair,</br>A chasten'd radiance on the glowing air;</br>'Tis thus on evening skies, so lovely bright,</br>Shines the departing gleam of the impurpling light.</br>"]
