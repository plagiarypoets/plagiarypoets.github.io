["With DAMON how oft have I stray'd,</br>In this garden bereft of it's flow'rs;</br>With pleasure each plant we survey'd,</br>As they thirstily drank up the show'rs!", "Content tripp'd it close at my side,</br>All my cares, and my sorrows forgot;</br>My bosom exulting with pride,</br>That Friendship now dwelt in my cot!", "But no more shall that friend lead me forth,</br>With his PHILLIS to pass the sweet day!</br>Since Nature this model of worth,</br>Has so cruelly taken away!", "But so chang'd now alas!  is the scene,</br>That it's pleasures no longer I know;</br>For each shrub is disrob'd of its green,</br>While our cot &mdash; is the cottage of woe!", "And behold in the midst of this gloom,</br>Sad PHILLIS with tear-streaming eyes;</br>Whose heart is enshrin'd in yon tomb,</br>Where the Lord of her bosom now lies!", "Ah!  why should a creature so meek,</br>Such anguish and sorrow ere know?</br>And why should that once blooming cheek,</br>Now assume the pale colour of snow?", "Soft Pity come haste to her aid,</br>Nor thus let her die with despair;</br>For Nature declares, she ne'er made</br>One more gentle, more good, or more fair!</br>"]
