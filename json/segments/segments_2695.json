["My Lord now quits his venerable seat,</br>The Six Clerk on his padlock turns the key,</br>From bus'ness hurries to his snug retreat,</br>And leaves Vacation, and the Town to me.", "Now all is hush'd, asleep the eye of care,</br>And Lincoln's Inn a solemn stillness holds,</br>Save where the Porter whistles o'er the Square,</br>Or Pompey barks, or basket woman scolds.", "Save that from yonder pump, and dusty stair,</br>The moping shoe-black, and the laundry maid,</br>Complain of such, as from the town repair,</br>And leave their little quarterage unpaid.", "In those dull chambers, where old parchments lie,</br>And useless draughts, in many a mould'ring heap,</br>Each for parade to catch the client's eye,</br>Salkeld and Ventris in Oblivion sleep.", "In these dread hours, what now remains for me,</br>Still to the stool and to the desk confin'd,</br>Debarr'd from Autumn shades, and Liberty,</br>Whose lips are soft as my Cleora's kind?", "Hail, charming maid!  how does thy presence gild</br>The brow of Care, and mitigate my pains!</br>With thee, (such extasy thy beauties yield)</br>Bondage is free, and hugs thy pleasing chains.", "Bless'd in thy love, sincerely I despise</br>The quibble warmly urg'd with many a frown,</br>Hear each opinion of the learn'd and wise,</br>Nor envy Cato's wig, nor Tully's gown.</br>"]
