["Ye Britons, whom the lyric muse inspires,</br>Why do ye all Pindaric numbers try?</br>O tune to humbler strains your feeble lyres,</br>Nor on such lofty pinions strive to fly,</br>Lest, trembling with the height, ye giddy grow,</br>Fall headlong from the skies, and reach the depths below.", "Pindar new ways and hidden paths explores,</br>By no harsh laws or critic rules confin'd;</br>Amidst th' aethereal plains he boldly soars,</br>Free as the wave, and lawless as the wind.</br>In jingling fetters bound, then, can we dare</br>To steer our course with him, and cleave the yielding air?", "Yet would I not put out the lyric flame,</br>Or banish Clio from this favour'd isle;</br>But only point an easier way to fame,</br>More suited to our genius, and our stile;</br>Like those soft lays, which gay Anacreon sung,</br>Or such as sweetly flow'd from gentler Sappho's tongue.", "Horace, the first of Rome's poetic train,</br>Who tun'd to Grecian sounds the Latin string,</br>Avoided still the bold Pindaric strain,</br>Content his odes in bounded verse to sing:</br>Yet, whilst his muse declin'd the arduous flight,</br>His genius urg'd her course beyond e'en Pindar's height.", "Since then these numbers greater freedom ask,</br>Than this our chiming metre can supply,</br>Ye bards, forsake the too laborious task,</br>Nor on such feeble wings ascend so high:</br>But, whilst the Theban Eagle soars above,</br>Let us, amidst the vales, on humbler pinions move.", "Pindar his nervous verses roll'd along,</br>As floods rush down some steepy mountain's side,</br>Whilst humbler runs our less aspiring song,</br>Like gentle streams which thro' the meadows glide:</br>Stronger than ours his mighty genius glows,</br>As fiercer than the brook the raging torrent flows.</br>"]
