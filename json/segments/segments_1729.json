["The gentlest sound which wakens echo's ear,</br>In pow'rless numbers breath'd without a guide,</br>Would fain with modest pleadings now be heard</br>By thee, O courteous Eve!", "Such as some Elfin minstrel lightly pours</br>In strains symphonious to thy whisp'ring gales,</br>As o'er the grave where dove-ey'd beauty sleeps,</br>Soft pity bends and mourns.", "Of such as village swains have taught to flow,</br>With pastoral music in some woodland wild,</br>Or she, the melancholy bird who sings</br>Amid thy mantling shade.", "O hither come, soft-footed matron Eve!</br>And whilst proud day-light in his pomp retires,</br>Dress'd like some pilgrim in his Palmer's weed,</br>With sober graces come.", "And to my sight those pensive charms reveal</br>Which please me more than all the gaudy hues,</br>Which Phoebus owns, when o'er the cheek of morn</br>He flings his colours gay.", "O come, and with thy sombre pallet draw</br>Those dark'ning lines which veil great Nature's face,</br>And from some holy tower or mountain give</br>Me, cloister'd nymph, to view", "The grey-rob'd landscape stealing slow away,</br>Where Sylvan spires and lessening groves are seen,</br>With low roof'd thatches, on whose simple shapes</br>Thy mild reflection gleams.", "Or view chaste Cynthia bend her pearly bow,</br>And greet thee Evening, with her kisses sweet,</br>And o'er thy shadowy features smiling throw</br>Her beams of softest light.", "Thee, best belov'd of all the virgin train,</br>In \"sweetly pleasing' numbers teach me how,</br>Pure Nature's nun, with licence unprofan'd,</br>To praise thy soft'ning mien.", "Which wins more true the feeling's sober turn,</br>Meek star-ey'd Eve, than all that morning boasts,</br>When first he waves his orient locks of gold,</br>Hung with Aurora's pearls.", "Still mayst thou smile, calm votaress, placid Eve,</br>With genial influence thro' earth's varying round;</br>So shall each season share thy kindliest beam,</br>And bless thy stedfast reign.</br>"]
