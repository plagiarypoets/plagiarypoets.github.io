["The Sun has sunk beneath the trembling wave,</br>To gild another Heaven with orient light,</br>And nought is heard amid the stillness, save</br>The lonely whisper of the conscious night;</br>How sweet to rove when veil'd from human sight</br>By the dark curtain which enwraps the sky,</br>How sweet to drink from thought the pure delight</br>Which ever shuns the gay, and still must fly</br>The fickle Sons of wantonness and vanity.", "Where are the hopes of Childhood, where of Youth,</br>The joyous vision which encharm'd the view?</br>Where are the friends whose constancy and truth</br>Would fresh for every scene our strength renew?</br>Our Fathers, where are they? &mdash; beneath the yew</br>The mouldering turf entombs their sacred earth</br>Their clay unconscious drinks the silent dew,</br>And left behind with aught that gave them birth,</br>Their weariness, and pain, their hopes and noisy mirth.", "And haply soon, o'er my departed dust,</br>The lonely cypress will its branches wave,</br>And soon at most receive its fragile trust,</br>The narrow precinct of my humble grave.</br>O God!  and is there nought on earth can save,</br>Nought that can teach me to avert the blow?</br>And is it vain a longer stay to crave,</br>And wilt Thou surely lay thy creature low?</br>Beneath thy chastening rod, O let me humbly bow.</br>"]
