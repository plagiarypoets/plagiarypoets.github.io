["Nay, reproach me not, sweet one!  I still am thine own,</br>Though the world in its toils hath detained me awhile!</br>The deep vision that spelled my lone bosom is flown,</br>And &mdash; a truant to love &mdash; I return to thy smile.</br>It hath ever been thus; &mdash; when condemned or deceived</br>By the many I scorned, or the few that I loved;</br>Whilst I breathed my contempt, or in silentness grieved,</br>It was bliss to remember whose truth I had proved;</br>And the falsehood of friends, the crowd's hollow decree,</br>Served to bind me more fondly and firmly to thee!", "Yes, I still am thine own: &mdash; though I sometimes may mingle,</br>In lightness of spirit, with fools I despise;</br>In my heart &mdash; my dark heart-dwelling silent and single,</br>Is the thought of all others it soothes me to prize.</br>If I join the loud throng in its madness of mirth,</br>I but think how much purer our pleasures have been;&mdash;</br>If I gaze on the fair-bosomed daughters of earth,</br>'Tis to turn to thy beauties &mdash; of beauty the Queen!</br>And if from man's dwellings to Nature I flee,</br>Glen, mountain, and ocean, seem breathing of thee!", "When a soft soothing glance from the eye of Affection</br>Breaks my midnight of gloom with its halo divine,</br>How surpassingly sweet is the fond recollection</br>Of the passionate love ever beaming from thine!&mdash;</br>'Twill beam on me no more. &mdash; Yet though Death has bereft me</br>Of a form such as seraphs from heaven might adore,&mdash;</br>In this image thy features of beauty are left me,</br>And the lines of thy soul in my heart's core of core!</br>Then reproach me not, sweet one!  for time shall not see</br>The hour that estranges one deep thought of thee!</br>"]
