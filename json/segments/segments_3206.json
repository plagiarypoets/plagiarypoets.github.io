["Ye nymphs, who unthinkingly rove,</br>As merry as crickets at eve;</br>Beware of Kadanda's false love,</br>For the shepherd will surely deceive.", "I once was as cheerful as you,</br>And pranc'd like a colt o'er the plain,</br>While swift as an arrow I flew,</br>I laugh'd at each amourous swain.", "My locks were as black as a crow,</br>And I dressed like a butterfly gay;</br>My skin was as white as the snow,</br>And I sung like a lark all the day.", "As unfix'd as the wind, or the weather,</br>I car'd not a fig what was said;</br>My heart was as light as a feather&mdash;</br>But now is as heavy as lead!", "For of late as I rambled the grove,</br>KADANDA I met the mean while;</br>He gaz'd &mdash; whin'd &mdash; and talked of love,</br>That I thought his words smoother than oil.", "His eyes were as blue as the sky,</br>And his ringlets were softer than silk;</br>His bosom was big with a sigh,</br>And his heart seem'd warm as new milk.", "His passion he swore was as strong</br>As mustard, as firm as a rock,</br>That his love should continue as long&mdash;</br>I believed every word that he spoke!", "He now has forsaken me quite,</br>Some other Jemima to follow;</br>But her favours the traitor will slight,</br>For his heart like a pumpkin is hollow.", "I mourn like a dove all the day,</br>And my face is grown lean as a rake;</br>My body is so pined away,</br>That I'm almost as poor as a snake.", "My locks are grown grey as a rat,</br>Which the swains us'd to praise and admire;</br>And my eyes are blind as a bat,</br>And with weeping become red as fire.", "Thus flat as a pan-cake I lie,</br>By love, cruel love I'm undone;</br>I am sick as a horse, and shall die</br>For KADANDA, as sure as a gun.</br>"]
