["The sun has risen, the youthful blush of day</br>Laughs ruddy nature into life again;</br>The fairy tinge of morning's golden ray</br>Smiles on the ocean, mountain, wood, and plain;</br>Rousing to weary toil the humble swain,</br>Waking again the city's buzzing sound,</br>Calling to life dull traffic's busy train,</br>Spreading the bustle of existence round;</br>Till in the night again the noisy din be drown'd.", "Yes, day!  to what a thousand varied calls</br>Is mankind summon'd by thy ceaseless roll!</br>On what a mixed throng thy radiance falls!</br>How diff'rent too thy dawn to every soul!</br>Some ever joy in thy benign control;</br>Yet others still destest thy fulgence bright,</br>Such as would willingingly infest the pole,</br>There to enjoy a demi-year of night;</br>They love so much the dark, they hate so much the light.", "Oh!  thou are pregnant with uncertain turns!</br>So full of change &mdash; thy sun hath often rose</br>On the fond fancy as with joy it burns,</br>And mark'd it frozen ere thy journey's close,</br>Lost in the dreary thought or drown'd by woes,</br>O'ercome by sad reverse, the bosom's bane:</br>How tedious roll away the hours to those,</br>Who, doom'd to linger out a life of pain,</br>Sustaining many an ill, must many an ill sustain.", "There are who hail thee with a heart of glee;</br>Those who await thy beam to make them blest:</br>Binding the lovers, settling captives free,</br>Giving to each that something in the breast,</br>That lulls the feelings into happy rest;</br>Freeing the glad'ning thought from fell suspense,</br>Bestowing certainty, a welcome guest,</br>Raising emotions that delight the sense,</br>Possessing sadness' place, and driving sorrow thence.", "But oh!  to him who pines in lonely cell</br>Till thy short lapse fulfil his tragic fate,</br>How quickly does thy course his bosom tell</br>That life's career draws tow'rds its final date;</br>Waking remorse's pang, but all too late,</br>Until the hour arrive, oh dreadful thought!</br>As flies remembrance back to happier state,</br>How sinks the haggard eye with madness fraught!</br>Hopeless, despairing still, he feels what sin has wrought.</br>"]
