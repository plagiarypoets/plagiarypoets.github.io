["Hence to some Convent's gloomy isles,</br>Where chearful day-light never smiles,</br>Tyrant, from Albion haste, to slavish Rome;</br>There by dim tapers' livid light,</br>At the still solemn hours of night,</br>In pensive musings walk o'er many a sounding tomb.", "Thy clanking chains, thy crimson steel,</br>Thy venom'd darts, and barbarous wheel,</br>Malignant fiend, bear from this isle away,</br>Nor dare in Error's setters bind</br>One active, freeborn, British mind,</br>That strongly strives to spring indignant from thy sway.", "Thou bad'st grim MOLOCH's frowning priest</br>Snatch screaming infants from the breast,</br>Regardless of the frantic mother's woes;</br>Thou led'st the ruthless sons of Spain</br>To wond'ring India's golden plain,</br>From deluges of blood where tenfold harvests rose.", "But lo!  how swiftly art thou fled,</br>When REASON lifts his radiant head;</br>When his resounding, awful voice they hear,</br>Blind IGNORANCE, thy doating sire,</br>Thy daughter, trembling FEAR, retire;</br>And all thy ghastly train of terrors disappear.", "So by the Magi hail'd from far,</br>When PHOEBUS mounts his early car,</br>The shrieking ghosts to their dark charnels flock;</br>The full-gorg'd wolves retreat, no more</br>The prowling lionesses roar,</br>But hasten with their prey to some deep-cavern'd rock.", "Mail then, ye friends of Reason hail,</br>Ye foes to Myst'ry's odious veil,</br>To Truth's high temple guide my steps aright,</br>Where CLARKE and WOOLASTON reside,</br>With LOCKE and NEWTON by their side,</br>While PLATO sits above enthron'd in endless light.</br>"]
