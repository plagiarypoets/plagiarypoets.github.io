["Hark, my fair one, the summons of love,</br>Cries, Away, my dear vot'ries, away:</br>Lovely Polly, beware how you prove</br>The mischances attending delay.", "See the vernal spring bloom all around,</br>And the gay fields in verdure array'd;</br>See the blythe Nymphs advance o'er the ground,</br>By their Shepherds so willingly fed.", "Then away with your ill-grounded fears,</br>Your romantic and idle alarms;</br>See the priest at the altar appears,</br>To secure you to Corydon's arms!", "Oh!  be wise, my dear charmer, in time,</br>Whilst the Graces your person adorn;</br>For, when once you have pass'd life's sweet prime,</br>You may long live a maiden forlorn!", "Let us haste the sweet bliss to secure,</br>We can each to the other impart;</br>And, in joys which shall ever endure,</br>Drive affliction away from our heart.</br>"]
