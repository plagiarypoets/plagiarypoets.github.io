["TO WILLIAM STEWART ROSE, ESQ.</br>Ashestiel, Ettricke Forest.", "November's sky is chill and drear,</br>November's leaf is red and sear:</br>Late, gazing down the steepy linn,</br>That hems our little garden in,</br>Low in its dark and narrow glen</br>You scarce the rivulet might ken,</br>So thick the tangled greenwood grew,</br>So feeble trilled the streamlet through:</br>Now, murmuring hoarse, and frequent seen</br>Through bush and brier, no longer green,</br>An angry brook, it sweeps the glade,</br>Brawls over rock and wild cascade,</br>And, foaming brown with doubled speed,</br>Hurries its waters to the Tweed.", "No longer Autumn's glowing red</br>Upon our Forest hills is shed;</br>No more beneath the evening beam</br>Fair Tweed reflects their purple gleam;</br>Away hath passed the heather-bell</br>That bloomed so rich on Needpath-fell;</br>Sallow his brow; and russet bare</br>Are now the sister-heights of Yair.</br>The sheep, before the pinching heaven,</br>To sheltered dale and down are driven,</br>Where yet some faded herbage pines,</br>And yet a watery sunbeam shines:</br>In meek despondency they eye</br>The withered sward and wintry sky,</br>And far beneath their summer hill,</br>Stray sadly by Glenkinnon's rill:</br>The shepherd shifts his mantle's fold,</br>And wraps him closer from the cold;</br>His dogs no merry circles wheel,</br>But shivering follow at his heel;</br>A cowering glance they often cast,</br>As deeper moans the gathering blast.", "My imps, though hardy, bold, and wild,</br>As best befits the mountain child,</br>Feel the sad influence of the hour,</br>And wail the daisy's vanished flower;</br>Their summer gambols tell, and mourn,</br>And anxious ask, &mdash; Will spring return,</br>And birds and lambs again be gay,</br>And blossoms clothe the hawthorn spray?", "Yes, prattlers, yes; the daisy's flower</br>Again shall paint your summer bower;</br>Again the hawthorn shall supply</br>The garlands you delight to tie;</br>The lambs upon the lea shall bound,</br>The wild birds carol to the round,</br>And, while you frolic light as they,</br>Too short shall seem the summer day.", "To mute and to material things</br>New life revolving summer brings;</br>The genial call dead Nature hears,</br>And in her glory reappears.</br>But Oh!  my country's wintry state</br>What second spring shall renovate?</br>What powerful call shall bid arise</br>The buried warlike and the wise;</br>The mind that thought for Britain's weal,</br>The hand that grasp'd the victor steel?</br>The vernal sun new life bestows</br>Even on the meanest flower that blows;</br>But vainly, vainly may he shine</br>Where glory weeps o'er NELSON'S shrine;</br>And vainly pierce the solemn gloom,</br>That shrouds, O PITT, thy hallowed tomb!", "Deep graved in every British heart,</br>O never let those names depart</br>Say to your sons, &mdash; Lo, here his grave,</br>Who victor died on Gadite wave;</br>To him, as to the burning levin,</br>Short, bright, resistless course was given;</br>Where'er his country's foes were found,</br>Was heard the fated thunder's sound,</br>Till burst the bolt on yonder shore,</br>Rolled, blazed, destroyed, &mdash; and was no more.", "Nor mourn ye less his perished worth</br>Who bade the conqueror go forth,</br>And launched that thunderbolt of war</br>On Egypt, Hafnia, Trafalgar;</br>Who, born to guide such high emprize,</br>For Britain's weal was early wise;</br>Alas!  to whom the Almighty gave,</br>For Britain's sins, an early grave!</br>His worth who, in his mightiest hour,</br>A bauble held the pride of power,</br>Spurned at the sordid lust of pelf,</br>And served his Albion for herself;</br>Who, when the frantic crowd amain</br>Strained at subjection's bursting rein,</br>O'er their wild mood full conquest gained,</br>The pride, he would not crush, restrained,</br>Showed their fierce zeal a worthier cause,</br>And brought the freeman's arm to aid the freeman's laws.", "Had'st thou but lived, though stripped of power,</br>A watchman on the lonely tower,</br>Thy thrilling trump had roused the land,</br>When fraud or danger were at hand;</br>By thee, as by the beacon-light,</br>Our pilots had kept course aright;</br>As some proud column, though alone,</br>Thy strength had propped the tottering throne.</br>Now is the stately column broke,</br>The beacon-light is quenched in smoke,</br>The trumpet's silver sound is still,</br>The warder silent on the hill!", "Oh, think, how to his latest day,</br>When Death, just hovering, claimed his prey,</br>With Palinure's unaltered mood,</br>Firm at his dangerous post he stood;</br>Each call for needful rest repelled,</br>With dying hand the rudder held,</br>Till, in his fall, with fateful sway,</br>The steerage of the realm gave way!</br>Then, while on Britain's thousand plains,</br>One unpolluted church remains,</br>Whose peaceful bells ne'er sent around</br>The bloody tocsin's maddening sound,</br>But still, upon the hallowed day,</br>Convoke the swains to praise and pray;</br>While faith and civil peace are dear,</br>Grace this cold marble with a tear,&mdash;</br>He, who preserved them, PITT, lies here!", "Nor yet suppress the generous sigh,</br>Because his rival slumbers nigh;</br>Nor be thy requiescat dumb,</br>Lest it be said o'er Fox's tomb.</br>For talents mourn, untimely lost,</br>When best employed, and wanted most;</br>Mourn genius high, and lore profound,</br>And wit that loved to play, not wound;</br>And all the reasoning powers divine,</br>To penetrate, resolve, combine;</br>And feelings keen, and fancy's glow,&mdash;</br>They sleep with him who sleeps below:</br>And, if thou mourn'st they could not save</br>From error him who owns this grave,</br>Be every harsher thought suppressed,</br>And sacred be the last long rest!</br>Here, where the end of earthly things</br>Lays heroes, patriots, bards, and kings;</br>Where stiff the hand, and still the tongue,</br>Of those who fought, and spoke, and sung;</br>Here, where the fretted aisles prolong</br>The distant notes of holy song,</br>As if some angel spoke agen,</br>All peace on earth, good-will to men;</br>If ever from an English heart,</br>O, here let prejudice depart,</br>And, partial feeling cast aside,</br>Record, that Fox a Briton died!</br>When Europe crouched to France's yoke,</br>And Austria bent, and Prussia broke,</br>And the firm Russian's purpose brave,</br>Was bartered by a timorous slave,</br>Even then dishonour's peace he spurned,</br>The sullied olive-branch returned,</br>Stood for his country's glory fast,</br>And nailed her colours to the mast.</br>Heaven, to reward his firmness, gave</br>A portion in this honoured grave,</br>And ne'er held marble in its trust</br>Of two such wondrous men the dust.", "With more than mortal powers endowed,</br>How high they soared above the crowd</br>Theirs was no common party race,</br>Jostling by dark intrigue for place;</br>Like fabled Gods, their mighty war</br>Shook realms and nations in its jar;</br>Beneath each banner proud to stand,</br>Looked up the noblest of the land,</br>Till through the British world were known</br>The names of PITT and Fox alone.</br>Spells of such force no wizard grave</br>E'er framed in dark Thessalian cave,</br>Though his could drain the ocean dry,</br>And force the planets from the sky.</br>These spells are spent, and, spent with these</br>The wine of life is on the lees;</br>Genius, and taste, and talent gone,</br>For ever tombed beneath the stone,</br>Where-taming thought to human pride</br>The mighty chiefs sleep side by side.</br>Drop upon Fox's grave the tear,</br>'Twill trickle to his rival's bier;</br>O'er PITT'S the mournful requiem sound,</br>And Fox's shall the notes rebound.</br>The solemn echo seems to cry,&mdash;</br>\"Here let their discord with them die.</br>Speak not for those a separate doom,</br>Whom Fate made Brothers in the tomb;</br>But search the land of living men,</br>Where wilt thou find their like agen?\"", "Rest, ardent Spirits!  till the cries</br>Of dying Nature bid you rise;</br>Not even your Britain's groans can pierce</br>The leaden silence of your hearse;</br>Then, O how impotent and vain</br>This grateful tributary strain;</br>Though not unmarked from northern clime,</br>Ye heard the Border Minstrel's rhyme:</br>His Gothic harp has o'er you rung;</br>The Bard you deigned to praise, your deathless names has sung.", "Stay yet, illusion, stay a while,</br>My wildered fancy still beguile!</br>From this high theme how can I part,</br>Ere half unloaded is my heart!</br>For all the tears e'er sorrow drew</br>And all the raptures fancy knew,</br>And all the keener rush of blood,</br>That throbs through bard in bard-like mood,</br>Were here a tribute mean and low,</br>Though all their mingled streams could flow&mdash;</br>Woe, wonder, and sensation high,</br>In one spring-tide of ecstasy.&mdash;</br>It will not be &mdash; it may not last&mdash;</br>The vision of enchantment's past:</br>Like frost-work in the morning ray,</br>The fancied fabric melts away;</br>Each Gothic arch, memorial stone,</br>And long, dim, lofty aisle, are gone,</br>And, lingering last, deception dear,</br>The choir's high sounds die on my ear.</br>Now slow return the lonely down,</br>The silent pastures bleak and brown,</br>The farm begirt with copse-wood wild,</br>The gambols of each frolic child,</br>Mixing their shrill cries with the tone</br>Of Tweed's dark waters rushing on.", "Prompt on unequal tasks to run,</br>Thus Nature disciplines her son:</br>Meeter, she says, for me to stray,</br>And waste the solitary day,</br>In plucking from yon fen the reed,</br>And watch it floating down the Tweed;</br>Or idly list the shrilling lay,</br>With which the milkmaid cheers her way,</br>Marking its cadence rise and fail,</br>As from the field, beneath her pail,</br>She trips it down the uneven dale:</br>Meeter for me, by yonder cairn,</br>The ancient shepherd's tale to learn,</br>Though oft he stop in rustic fear,</br>Lest his old legends tire the ear</br>Of one, who, in his simple mind,</br>May boast of book-learned taste refined.", "But thou, my friend, canst fitly tell,</br>(For few have read romance so well,)</br>How still the legendary lay</br>O'er poet's bosom holds its sway;</br>How on the ancient minstrel strain</br>Time lays his palsied hand in vain;</br>And how our hearts at doughty deeds,</br>By warriors wrought in steely weeds,</br>Still throb for fear and pity's sake;</br>As when the Champion of the Lake</br>Enters Morgana's fated house,</br>Or, in the Chapel Perilous.</br>Despising spells and demons' force,</br>Holds converse with the unburied corse;</br>Or when, Dame Ganore's grace to move,</br>(Alas, that lawless was their love!)</br>He sought proud Tarquin in his den,</br>And freed full sixty knights; or when,</br>A sinful man, and unconfessed,</br>He took the Sangreal's holy quest,</br>And, slumbering, saw the vision high,</br>He might not view with waking eye.", "The mightiest chiefs of British song</br>Scorned not such legends to prolong:</br>They gleam through Spenser's elfin dream,</br>And mix in Milton's heavenly theme;</br>And Dryden, in immortal strain,</br>Had raised the Table Round again,</br>But that a ribald King and Court</br>Bade him toil on, to make them sport;</br>Demanded for their niggard pay,</br>Fit for their souls, a looser lay,</br>Licentious satire, song, and play;</br>The world defrauded of the high design,</br>Profaned the God-given strength, and marred the lofty line.", "Warmed by such names, well may we then,</br>Though dwindled sons of little men,</br>Essay to break a feeble lance</br>In the fair fields of old romance;</br>Or seek the moated castle's cell,</br>Where long through talisman and spell,</br>While tyrants ruled, and damsels wept,</br>Thy Genius, Chivalry, bath slept:</br>There sound the harpings of the North,</br>Till he awake and sally forth,</br>On venturous quest to prick again,</br>In all his arms, with all his train,</br>Shield, lance, and brand, and plume,</br>Fay, giant, dragon, squire, and dwarf,</br>And wizard with his wand of might,</br>And errant maid on palfrey white.</br>Around the Genius weave their spells,</br>Pure Love, who scarce his passion tells;</br>Mystery, half veiled and half revealed;</br>And Honour, with his spotless shield;</br>Attention, with fixed eye; and Fear,</br>That loves the talc she shrinks to hear;</br>And gentle Courtesy; and Faith,</br>Unchanged by sufferings, time, or death;</br>And Valour, lion-mettled lord,</br>Leaning upon his own good sword.", "Well has thy fair achievement shown,</br>A worthy meed may thus be won;</br>Ytene's oaks &mdash; beneath whose shade</br>Their theme the merry minstrels made,</br>Of Ascapart, and Bevis bold,</br>And that Red King, who, while of old,</br>Through Boldrewood the chase he led,</br>By his loved huntsman's arrow bled&mdash;</br>Ytene's oaks have heard again</br>Renewed such legendary strain;</br>For thou hast sung, how He of Gaul,</br>That Amadis so famed in hall,</br>For Oriana, foiled in fight</br>The Necromancer's felon might;</br>And well in modern verse hast wove</br>Partenopex's mystic love:</br>Hear, then, attentive to my lay,</br>A knightly tale of Albion's elder day.</br>"]
