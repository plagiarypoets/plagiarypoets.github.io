["Methinks I heare some foule-mouth'd Momus say,</br>What have we here?  a shepheards roundelay?</br>More love-tricks yet?  will this geare never end,</br>But slight lascivious toyes must still bee pend?</br>Content thee Momus, thou hast lost thy sight,</br>For this is neither vaine, obsceane, nor slight.", "If for to write of Love, and Loves delights,</br>Be not fit objects for the graver sights,</br>Then stil admired Chaucer, thou maist rue</br>And write thy auncient stories all anew:</br>And that same Fayry Muse may rise againe,</br>To blot those works that with us do remaine.", "Then feare not Weever, let thy Muse go on,</br>Thy maiden Muse, thy chaste Endimeon:</br>To blazon forth the love of shepheard swaines,</br>As well in Cottage as in Court Love raines.</br>And whosoever shall chance thy booke to see,</br>In it shall reade ripe wit, sweet Poetrie.</br>"]
