I remember well that fatal day</br>When noble Urburgh fell, the despots' prey:</br>The previous night, when hostile armies closed</br>Around her barriers, not an eye reposed;</br>Thousands were listening to the distant drum,</br>To judge how nigh the gathering foe was come:</br>The cannons' bursting sound, that cleav'd the air,</br>Was follow'd by the blankness of despair!</br>At intervals some shooting rocket rose,</br>A signal to direct the march of foes.</br>The mansions pour'd their inmates on the street,</br>Where mingling strangers seem'd like friends to meet;</br>At every turn some crowd consulting stood,</br>Dreading the coming morn would rise in blood.</br>And there was hurrying, rushing to and fro</br>Of man and horse &mdash; a people whelm'd in woe!</br>And men were shouting for their friends; and cries</br>Of women trembled in the echoing skies!</br>The high &mdash; the low &mdash; were blended in one throng,</br>That like a stormy river roll'd along;</br>All ranks abroad, as by one impulse, flock'd,</br>Leaving their dwellings darken'd and unlock'd;</br>Save where a light through some lone casement beam'd,</br>That like a meteor o'er the tempest gleam'd;</br>Whose inmates hurried through the sleepless night</br>The preparation for the morrow's flight.</br>The time had been &mdash; and here &mdash; when such an hour</br>Had found those thousands sunk in slumber's power&mdash;</br>Breathing unconscious life, or dreaming bliss&mdash;</br>But sleep could never reign o'er scene like this;</br>Where shouts and curses &mdash; terror and despair&mdash;</br>Roll'd all their mingled sounds along the air.</br>Once he who through the streets, at midnight, past,</br>Might deem himself of all mankind the last;</br>So peaceful, solitary, still and dead&mdash;</br>As all who throng'd them yesterday were fled&mdash;</br>Now &mdash;

reckless &mdash; stay'd to brave the worst!</br>In sullen hate upon the foe they gazed;</br>And cursed the hostile flag that triumph raised;</br>Borne by the very hands that oft' before</br>Had lost the trophies Urburgh proudly wore.</br>In endless columns they advanc'd along,</br>Safe in her weakness, and in numbers strong;</br>Like the fierce torrent that the mountain pours,</br>Tearing the ravaged vales through which it roars.</br>The heavy tread of many thousand feet,</br>Shaking the ground, past on from street to street;</br>The tramp of steed follow'd the rumbling gun,</br>And noon was glowing ere their march was done&mdash;</br>The drums that peal'd their thunder on the air,</br>Roll'd the last echoes of a land's despair;</br>And the shrill trumpet's loud and piercing breath,</br>Burst on the fallen like the blast of death!</br>Yes &mdash;

from room to room,</br>And in those lordly mansions met their doom:</br>Doors shatter'd &mdash; stain'd with blood &mdash; remain'd to tell</br>The tale of those who bravely fought and fell:</br>And heroes dropp'd, life's crimson stream to pour</br>Upon the richly decorated floor;</br>And shouts and tumults in those chambers rung,</br>Where night her veil o'er silent couches flung:</br>Where once the concert pour'd its witching strain,</br>Echoed the clash of swords, the groans of pain!</br>Floors, where the joyous dance its mazes spread,</br>Shook with the struggling warriors' heavy tread:</br>Where elegance in golden luxury dwelt&mdash;</br>Where every bliss of polish'd life was felt&mdash;</br>The rage of slaughter breathed &mdash; the blows of death were dealt!</br>So oft' some sweetly smiling, favor'd scene,</br>Adorn'd with flowers, and ever cloth'd in green;</br>Where ages past had smoothly roll'd away;</br>Nor brought one freezing, burning, stormy day&mdash;</br>Beholds at last a sudden tempest driven,</br>Gather'd and borne upon the winds of heaven;</br>That bursts with desolating force around,</br>And strews with wreck the lately smiling ground.", "The day's last streak of light dissolved away;</br>The strife was done &mdash; for none were left to slay!</br>Of all that desperate, devoted band,</br>Not one remain'd to move a hostile hand.</br>Their patriot fire was quench'd &mdash; their duty o'er&mdash;</br>The spark extinct that nothing can restore!</br>And they were stretch'd upon the silent bier;</br>The last &mdash;
