["Far in the North, where stands a Range of Trees,</br>Where Nature smiling feels the whisp'ring Breeze,</br>There's seen a Village which is fair and bright,</br>'Tis lovely all, it entertains the Sight.</br>Aurora, Cynthia, Phoebus, Phosphor shed</br>Their choicest Glories on it's rising Head.</br>It's various Beauties strike the wond'ring Eye,</br>Oft as the Morn does purple o'er the Sky.</br>The Houses that compose it all are plain,</br>One simple Throng, yet one agreeable Train;</br>Simplicity and Neatness there display'd,</br>Improve the Scene, and does the Landscape aid,</br>Sweet Summer decks the Place, and genial Spring renews the neighbouring Glade.</br>Here stands a Cottage on the painted Ground,</br>And there another is with Ivy crown'd.</br>The Village Tops in beauteous Prospect rise,</br>Grac'd by the Sun which warms the neigh'bring Skies.</br>There's interspers'd along the shining Way,</br>Things here and there which do their Charms display.</br>A Range of Huts which are detach'd from these,</br>Amuse the Fancy, and the Judgment please.</br>The mantled Green which does it's Foliage spread,</br>Springs o'er the Wood, and on it rears it's Head;</br>Amid the Leaves the gentle Zephyrs move,</br>Sport underneath, and thro' the Verdure rove.</br>The Entrance of the Village lovely seems,</br>By Brooks supply'd and wash'd by silver Streams.</br>Before the Doors which to the Huts belong,</br>The Women stand, the Ground the Children throng;</br>The little Boys and Girls together play,</br>By Cynthia's Light, and by the Solar Ray,</br>The Village rings with Joy each chearful Summer's Day.</br>Sweet Music sounds which country Swains admire;</br>The Church at Distance lifts it's pointed Spire.</br>Who passes by may with his Eyes behold,</br>The Stalls, where Apples, Pears, and Plumbs are sold.</br>There Colin lives on yonder Spot of Ground,</br>And Colinett is in his Cottage found;</br>There's Tom the Fidler he that strikes the Strings,</br>Delights the Rusticks while he sweetly sings.</br>Throughout the Village, through the charming Scene,</br>Fair Innocence and Friendship reign serene;</br>The streaky Green appears where fairy Elves</br>Each moon-light Night assemble by themselves:</br>Trees spread their Boughs and scented Flowers spring,</br>And on the House-tops feather'd Songsters sing;</br>The bleating Lambs run skipping up and down,</br>And with their artless Charms the Village crown.</br>Not Art, but Nature, thro' the whole's descry'd,</br>Divested of her Pomp and superfluous Pride.</br>The Priest who watches for the Village Train,</br>Is dear to every honest country Swain;</br>Good Humour softens all his god-like Speech;</br>Oh!  what a Joy it is to hear him preach.</br>He's chearful, courteous, tender, just and kind,</br>Allied to Virtue and to Peace inclin'd:</br>Humanity and Love, and Meekness fine,</br>Adorns the Man, and decks the whole divine.</br>Just as his Manners, is his Temper mild,</br>He has the native Sweetness of a Child.</br>The conscious Swains his wond'rous Virtues sing,</br>The neighbouring Places with his Praises ring:</br>For him the Shepherds touch the harmonious String.</br>There's few that's like him, very few indeed,</br>'Tis certain so it is by all agreed,</br>He studies much but prays and preaches more,</br>His Piety it is that joins his Lore:</br>No cooing Turtles half so gentle be,</br>The Zephyr's Breath is not so mild as he.</br>He wins by gentle Means and Methods rare,</br>He drives no Sinner into deep Despair;</br>Like his great Master is the Preacher fair.</br>Some wear the Gown to hide their growing Sin,</br>But he has ta'en it to be pure within.</br>He eloquently pleads the Needy's Cause,</br>Be his the Praise, and his the whole Applause.</br>The Man is blest, he in Religion shines,</br>Transcending famous Priests, and other learn'd Divines;</br>'Tis to his Honour that he loves to draw;</br>To him the Scriptures is a written Law:</br>He says the Gospel first for Man was made,</br>And that the Clergy ought to hear it read;</br>That 'tis their Duty to display it's Charms,</br>But not to dress it up with inconvenient Harms.</br>As soon as Titan gilds the rosy Morn,</br>The Village Priest trips o'er the dewy Lawn.</br>And o'er the verdant Plain he takes his Way,</br>He eyes th' Blue which speaks th' Almighty's Sway,</br>And then submissive kneels, before the God of Day:</br>And while Aurora spreads her Glories round,</br>The holy Preacher treads the silken Ground.</br>He's fond of Flowers, these the learn'd admire,</br>Flowers inform'd the Sage and did his Mind inspire.</br>He's done a thousand Things which merit Praise;</br>His christian Love his Charity displays:</br>Religiously he does the Sabbath spend,</br>Affirming 'twas ordain'd for such an End;</br>What Jesus taught and the Apostles spread,</br>By this the holy Man of God is led.</br>Smiling, he speaks all placid and serene,</br>And Reason's Sunshine, settles round his Mien:</br>He never swears, nor talks, nor jests obscene.</br>He is from Avarice and Ambition free;</br>The Village Parson does with all agree.</br>He loaths a sad unnecessary Pride;</br>Our blessed Lord condemns it too beside:</br>The golden Maxims which confirm the Whole,</br>Guides him thro' Life and sweetly tunes his Soul.</br>Since he has grown mature he's always trod</br>The Paths of Peace, because he loves his God;</br>He checks the Wicked, yet he wont revile,</br>Nor pens his Sermons in a florid Style.</br>The Parson's never at the Alehouse found,</br>Nor idly spends his Time, nor spreads Damnation round:</br>He dwells on no such wild phantastick Strain,</br>Which none but mad Enthusiasts maintain.</br>In Words distinct he does at Church relate,</br>The distant Glories of the future State:</br>Crowds hear him quickly with their outward Ears,</br>He sooths their Pains, he mitigates their Fears.</br>Some in the Pulpit prate and talk away,</br>Flourish to get a Name, and all their Arts display;</br>But he exhorts the Throng, with modest Speech, upon the Sabbath-Day.</br>From off his Tongue his melting Accents flow,</br>And when he talks the Preacher seems to glow,</br>His Merits all his long Discourses shew.</br>He feeds the Poor, Oh!  what a matchless Head,</br>The hungry Boys that's forc'd to beg their Bread:</br>With him the honest Village Tribe agree,</br>None is respected more, for none's so good as he:</br>He loves his Children and adores his Wife,</br>His pleasing Presence quick disperses Strife.</br>The other Day he sav'd a famish'd Child,</br>His Christian Love is so serenely mild.</br>He does his best, nay, more than what's requir'd,</br>He is by Christ, and by his God inspir'd.</br>At early Mattins he is constant there,</br>And so he is at other Hours of Prayer;</br>He makes his Flock his most peculiar Care;</br>He stretches out to all, his bounteous Hand,</br>And round the Bed of Sickness takes his Stand;</br>Dries up the Tears which often drown the Eyes,</br>Relieves the Orphan, stops the Widow's Cries.</br>He grows renown'd, tho' much he slighteth Fame,</br>To rise to Goodness is his glorious Aim;</br>Besides, he does in holy Works increase,</br>And seems a fair Perfection in one Piece:</br>He wont upon the Poor his Claims renew,</br>For rather than he'll strain, he'll go without his Due.</br>In this his Goodness is the more display'd,</br>Retaining what the great Messiah said;</br>Christ bade him first be kind, and Christ must be obey'd.</br>He the bright Son of Heaven's eternal Sire,</br>Does from his Followers christian Love require.</br>The Village Priest is always neat and plain,</br>He's known by walking with a fav'rite Cane:</br>The op'ning Bloom of Beauty decks his Years,</br>Conspicuous shines and in his Face appears:</br>Health sits upon his Cheek and crowns his Mien;</br>When Phoebus smiles the Parson seeks the Green.</br>Oh!  how he takes Delight to soften Woe,</br>It seems to be his Province here below:</br>From him as from above spontaneous Blessings flow.</br>Ye Strangers think not these are partial Lays,</br>Nor call the Muse too lavish in his Praise;</br>The Lamp of Day which gilds the azure Sphere,</br>Is Witness to his Worth which shines so clear:</br>And pale fac'd Cynthia with her silver Beam,</br>At Night beholds him worship the Supreme.</br>He, when the foolish Scene of Life is o'er,</br>Shall meet his God, shall meet to part no more.</br>And when his Soul at length shall leave his Clay,</br>He shall be borne to Realms of endless Day;</br>The Angels now which guard him in his Bed,</br>To waft him there their painted Wings shall spread.</br>Whene'er he quits this World, this Place of Woe,</br>He will to Heaven and endless Pleasure go:</br>Where the Good rest from Care, it must be so.</br>This Man of God, this sweet religious Soul,</br>Does not in Honours nor in Riches roll;</br>Can such a Saint, &mdash; can such a Christian die,</br>And not inherit Immortality?</br>His Virtues far surpass the fancied Kind,</br>With Goodness sweeten'd and with Charms refin'd;</br>This pious Priest, of whom the Muse has sung,</br>Breaths Mercy from his Lips and Softness from his Tongue.</br>"]
