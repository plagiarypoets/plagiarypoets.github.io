["O gentle nymph, of Cornish lond the Queen,</br>Whom all our youth behold with rap'rous love;</br>Whose heart eclipseth e'en they beauty's sheen,</br>Read Petrarch's sorrows, and with tears approve:</br>A tear from thee, surpassing all his fame,</br>Embalms with immortality his name.", "At Petrarch's fate the heart with grief mote glow,</br>Who frequent woo'd the Fair but woo'd in vain;</br>Thy Turtle even in streams will certes flow</br>At sorrows, that for peerless Laura plain,</br>When pale entomb'd, her lovely limbs were laid,</br>And redbreasts sooth'd with ditties sweet her shade.", "Rash bard!  what folly taught thine eyen to gaze</br>On her, who ne'er could bless thy longing arms?</br>What daemon urg'd thee, 'midst her beauty's blaze,</br>Bereft of smallest hope, to win her charms?</br>Well did thine heart deserve sic mickle woes,</br>That lost in wild romaunce its dear repose.", "Yet, Petrarch!  like thyself, a bard betray'd</br>By smiles of Beauty, Wisdom's voice I slight;</br>Hopeless I glore upon so fair a maid,</br>As ever charm'd the golden eye of light.</br>Then let me blame no more thy lovelorn line,</br>Perchaunce thy Laura mote compare with mine!</br>"]
