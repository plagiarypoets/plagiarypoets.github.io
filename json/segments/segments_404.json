["When Ramsay drew Montgomery heavenly maid,</br>And gaz'd with wonder on that angel face,</br>Pleas'd I sat by, and joyful survey'd</br>The darren pencil image every grace.", "When as the youth, each feature o'er and o'er</br>Careful retouch'd with strict observant view;</br>Eftsoons I saw how charms unseen before</br>Swell'd to the sight, and with the picture grew.", "With milder glances now he arms her eyes,</br>The red now triumphs to a brighter rose;</br>Now heaves her bosom to a softer rise,</br>And fairer on her cheek the lilly blows.", "Last glow'd the blush that pure of female wile,</br>I whilom knew when so my stars decreed,</br>My pipe she daign'd to laud in pleasing smile,</br>All undeserving I such worthy meed.", "The whiles I gaz'd, ah!  felice Art thought I,</br>Ah!  felice youth that doen it possess;</br>Couth to depeint the fair so verily,</br>True to each charm, and faithful to each grace.", "Sythence she cannot emulate her skill,</br>Ne envy will the Muse her sisters praise,</br>Then for the deed, O let her place the will,</br>And to the glowing colours join her layes.", "Yet algates would the nine, that high on hill</br>Parnasse, sweet Imps of Jove, with Jove reside,</br>Give me to rein the feiry steed at will,</br>And with kind hand thy lucky pencil guide.", "Then certes mought we fate misprise, of praise</br>Secure, if the dear maid in beauties bloom</br>Survive, or in thy colours, or my lays,</br>Joy of this age, and joy of each to come.</br>"]
