["Now Morning from her orient chamber came,</br>And her first footsteps touch'd a verdant hill;</br>Crowning its lawny crest with amber flame,</br>Silv'ring the untainted gushes of its rill;</br>Which, pure from mossy beds, did down distill,</br>And after parting beds of simple flowers,</br>By many streams a little lake did fill,</br>Which round its marge reflected woven bowers,</br>And, in its middle space, a sky that never lowers.", "There the king-fisher saw his plumage bright</br>Viewing with fish of brilliant dye below;</br>Whose silken fins, and golden scales' light</br>Cast upward, through the waves, a ruby glow:</br>There saw the swan his neck of arched snow,</br>And oar'd himself along with majesty;</br>Sparkled his jetty eyes; his feet did show</br>Beneath the waves like Afric's ebony,</br>And on his back a fay reclined voluptuously.", "Ah!  could I tell the wonders of an isle</br>That in that fairest lake had placed been,</br>I could e'en Dido of her grief beguile;</br>Or rob from aged Lear his bitter teen:</br>For sure so fair a place was never seen,</br>Of all that ever charm'd romantic eye:</br>It seem'd an emerald in the silver sheen</br>Of the bright waters; or as when on high,</br>Through clouds of fleecy white, laughs the coerulean sky.", "And all around it dipp'd luxuriously</br>Slopings of verdure through the glossy tide,</br>Which, as it were in gentle amity,</br>Rippled delighted up the flowery side;</br>As if to glean the ruddy tears, it tried,</br>Which fell profusely from the rose-tree stem!</br>Haply it was the workings of its pride,</br>In strife to throw upon the shore a gem</br>Outvieing all the buds in Flora's diadem.</br>"]
