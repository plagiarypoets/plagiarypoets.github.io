["Come Shepherds, we'll follow the Hearse,</br>And see our lov'd Corydon laid;</br>Tho' Sorrow may blemish the Verse,</br>Yet let a sad Tribute be paid.</br>They call'd him the Pride of the Plain:</br>In sooth he was gentle and kind;</br>He mark'd in his elegant Strain</br>The Graces that glow'd in his Mind.", "On purpose he planted yon Trees,</br>That Birds in the Covert might dwell:</br>He cultur'd his Thyme for the Bees,</br>But never once rifled their Cell.</br>Ye Lambkins that play'd at his Feet,</br>Go bleat &mdash; and your Master bemoan:</br>His Musick was artless and sweet,</br>His Manners as mild as your own.", "No Verdure shall cover the Vale,</br>No Bloom on the Blossoms appear,</br>The Sweets of the Forest shall fail,</br>And Winter encompass the Year;</br>No Birds in our Hedges shall sing,</br>(Our Hedges so vocal before!)</br>Since he that should welcome the Spring,</br>Can greet the gay Season no more.", "His Phillis was proud of his Praise,</br>And Poets came round in a Throng:</br>They listen'd, &mdash; and envy'd his Lays;</br>But which of them equal'd the Song?</br>Ye Shepherds, henceforward be mute,</br>For lost is the Pastoral Strain:</br>So give me my Corydon's Flute,</br>And thus &mdash; let me break it in Twain!</br>"]
