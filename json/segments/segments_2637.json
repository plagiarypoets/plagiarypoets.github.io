["Come hither, ye shepherds, and list;</br>Pay attention to Corydon's lays:</br>O, join in the theme, and assist</br>To sing to my Florella's praise.</br>Florella, the pride of our plain;</br>Florella the lovely and fair;</br>But ah!  how she uses her swain,</br>And drives him almost to despair.", "No shepherd e'er lov'd her so well,</br>His passion is ardent and pure;</br>O!  could she his feelings but tell,</br>She surely his torments would cure.</br>Tho' fifty fair nymphs flock around,</br>And smile and invite him to roam;</br>Not one like Florella he's found,</br>The cot of Florella's his home.", "There viewing her beauteous face,</br>There list'ning to hear the nymph speak,</br>He gazes on ev'ry grace,</br>And eyes the sweet smiles on her cheek;</br>But ah!  are those smiles for her swain?</br>Alas!  other shepherds are blest;</br>And this gives him infinite pain,</br>He's not belov'd more than the rest.", "How sorrowful passes his day!</br>No pleasures can give him delight;</br>He takes up his pipe and he plays,</br>The tune is as dull as the night.</br>Florella sometimes will admire</br>The charms of his musical art;</br>But vainly his wishes aspire</br>To make a note reach to her heart.", "Sad, mourning, and weeping he goes,</br>No shepherd will pity his grief;</br>Florella, inform'd of his woes,</br>Refuses to give him relief:</br>Yet still of the nymphs of the plain,</br>Florella's to him the most fair;</br>Tho' cruel she uses her swain,</br>And drives him almost to despair.</br>"]
