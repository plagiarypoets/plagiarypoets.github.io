["O say!  where bloom those time-surviving groves</br>Where ancient bards first sung their sacred loves:</br>Those sadly-solemn bowers, ye Muses!  say,</br>Where once the melancholy Cowley lay?</br>When long perplex'd with Life's deluding snares,</br>Her flattering pleasures, and her fruitless cares;</br>Obscure he fled to sylvan shades alone,</br>And left mankind, to be for ever known.", "Such were the scenes where Spenser once retired,</br>When great Eliza's fame the Muse inspir'd;</br>When Gloriana led her poet's dreams</br>O'er flow'ry meadows, and by murm'ring streams.", "Immortal bards!  whose death-contemning lays</br>Shall shine, distinguish'd with eternal praise.</br>Knew my poor Muse like these to soar sublime,</br>And spurn the ruins of insulting Time,</br>Where'er I stray:  where blooming Flora leads,</br>O'er sunny mountains, and through purple meads;</br>Or careless in the sylvan covert laid,</br>Where falling rills amuse the mournful shade,</br>Ye, rural fields, should still resound my lay,</br>And thou, fair Studley!  smile for ever gay.</br>"]
