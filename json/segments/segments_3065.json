["STREPHON.  COLIN.", "'Twas ev'ning, benign were the skies,</br>We met where the maypole was rear'd;</br>And, warm for the Holiday Prize,</br>Two swains in the contest appear'd;</br>Two shepherds renown'd on the plains</br>For skill in the pastoral song:</br>And thus, in delectable strains,</br>Were led the gay carols along.", "STREPHON.</br>How sweet o'er the full-flowing bowl,</br>When gleeful companions are met,</br>With joy to replenish the soul,</br>And toils of the day to forget;</br>When social enjoyment runs high,</br>Tale jocund, or fanciful jest,</br>The frowns of dull care I defy,</br>For mirth is at home in my breast.", "COLIN.</br>When twilight grows dim on the plains,</br>'Tis sweet with my DELIA to rove,</br>Where nightingales warble their strains,</br>And quiet prevails in the grove;</br>All haunts of rude mirth I forsake,</br>Avoiding its clamour and strife;</br>But keep every feeling awake,</br>To nobler enjoyments of life.", "STREPHON.</br>The huntsman with merry-ton'd horn,</br>Bids valleys and mountains resound;</br>And early goes out in the morn,</br>To chase the fleet hare o'er the ground:</br>With him through thick woodlands I fly,</br>Through dangers, wild rivers, and rocks;</br>Whilst musical hounds, in full cry,</br>Run swift in pursuit of the fox.", "COLIN.</br>More pleas'd with the dangerless hour,</br>I plant in my garden the rose;</br>Or muse in my jessamine's bow'r,</br>Where nigh the sweet eglantine blows;</br>And, pleas'd with the blackbird and thrush,</br>I walk the green meadows along;</br>Or, under the bloom cover'd bush,</br>I sit and attend to their song.", "STREPHON.</br>In sports of the turf I delight,</br>The swift-running steeds of the race;</br>When holiday gambols invite,</br>I ev'ry gay moment embrace;</br>When mirthful at eve on the mead,</br>We lead the gay pastime along,</br>Through the rounds of its rapture I speed;</br>The frolick, the dance, and the song.", "COLIN.</br>More usefully spending the day,</br>My flocks I'll attend on the down;</br>Where, fled from all follies away,</br>The moments are sweetly my own;</br>I pleasures approv'd by the wise</br>In scenes of tranquility seek;</br>The noblest enjoyments arise</br>From thoughts that are peaceful and meek.", "STREPHON.</br>Through thickets with CHLORIS I walk;</br>I fondle with PHILLIS the fair;</br>AMYNTA can mirthfully talk,</br>How charming her shape and her air;</br>I, chief of the musical swains,</br>Could I wish to be fetter'd for life;</br>Might cull from the nymphs of our plains,</br>The fairest of all for my wife.", "COLIN.</br>My DELIA, for modesty fam'd,</br>For a soul that can folly despise;</br>My beautiful DELIA that's nam'd</br>By none but the good and the wise;</br>I lov'd her with passion unfeign'd,</br>For mental endowments alone;</br>The wish of my soul is obtain'd,</br>For, wedlock has made her my own.", "The prize was a pipe of renown,</br>It came from a region remote;</br>It's warblings at eve on the down</br>Out-rival'd the nightingale's throat;</br>Whilst loud approbation declar'd</br>The wish of th' unanimous throng;</br>This pipe was proclaim'd the reward</br>Of COLIN'S unparallel'd song.</br>"]
