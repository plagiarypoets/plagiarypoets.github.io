["When fam'd Eliza fill'd Britannia's throne,</br>And chiefs confess'd her sway, till then unknown;</br>When states oppress'd for her protection su'd,</br>And papal tyrants found themselves subdu'd;</br>Then Raleigh rose, and sought an honest fame,</br>With every worth that dignify'd its flame.</br>Good Cecil's sapience, Drake's far thundering ire,</br>Bacon's cool judgment, temp'ring Spenser's fire,</br>A Selden's mind to trace primeval gloom,</br>Restore lost time, and rescue from the tomb:</br>Tho' these in him, like suns reflected, shone,</br>And honours crown'd him which his merits won;</br>Tho' round his brow unfading laurels twin'd,</br>With blooming bays and flow'ring myrtles join'd;</br>Yet who, alas!  could honest worth defend,</br>When only fools and flatterers found a friend?</br>When unassuming worth was sought no more,</br>And all those suns eclips'd that shone before?</br>Nay, such the rancour in the following reign,</br>To blast those laurels they could ne'er attain;</br>That by mean arts, O ignominious deed!</br>Bade him, the barrier of his country, bleed.</br>Whilst vanquish'd Spain exulted o'er his fate,</br>The British genius mourn'd her darling state;</br>With shelt'ring pinions hover'd round no more,</br>But stretch'd her wings, and left the abject shore.</br>"]
