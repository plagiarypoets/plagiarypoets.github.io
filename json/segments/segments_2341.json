["What now avail to thee, those glittering toys,</br>Those gay delusive scenes, once much admir'd,</br>The splendid chariot, and the rake's applause,</br>Or all that human frailty e'er desir'd?", "Those hours are past!  nor youth nor beauty screen'd</br>Thy mortal frame from yielding up its breath;</br>Sunk from the pomp in which you lately reign'd,</br>In dark obscurity you sunk to death.", "Alas!  had those bright gifts on you bestown,</br>Been spent in virtue's unpolluted ways,</br>For your hard fate, the generous tears had flown,</br>Nor as an exile, had you clos'd your days.", "Possess'd of every charm, and every grace,</br>And of a mind accomplish'd as your mein;</br>How happy might you then have run your race,</br>Compos'd and cheerful, placid and serene.", "May gracious heav'n forgive your frailties here,</br>And blot away whate'er you've done amiss;</br>Grant you that pardon, which you beg'd sincere,</br>And give you entrance in the realms of bliss.", "Ye fair, attend, the sage advice pursue,</br>Nor swerve from virtue, which must ever bloom,</br>Its lovely precepts ever keep in view,</br>For that survives beyond the grave and tomb.</br>"]
