["In hardy Chivalry's advent'rous days,</br>At solemn feasts the Minstrel waked his lays:</br>Each trophy'd hall with tuneful echoes rung,</br>While godlike Chiefs and godlike deeds he sung;</br>Sung those famed fields where patriot Valour bled,</br>Where the Cross triumphed, and the Crescent fled;</br>Where Europe's sons, in Freedom's generous pride,</br>With dauntless breasts repell'd Invasion's tide.</br>Rapt with the strain, each Knight in Fancy's eye</br>Again beheld the hostile banners fly,</br>Again in thought, he grasp'd bright Valour's meed,</br>Resolved to vanquish, or resign'd to bleed.", "Less proud our boast &mdash; though still Britannia's name,</br>Fill the wide-echoing trump of martial Fame,</br>Though late her gen'rous warriors, calmly brave,</br>Alike have triumph'd on the land and wave,</br>Yet oft at social boards, where Temperance reigns,</br>Far gentler powers attune her festive strains:</br>There Bounty sits enthroned; while Mirth, enshrined</br>With Virtue's self, conspires to bless mankind.</br>Then, if in nobler verse those Bards sublime,</br>Who told the warlike feats of elder time,</br>Thrill'd ev'ry heart by Fancy's rapt'rous dream;</br>More pure our object, more benign our theme.</br>Remote from factious strife, or blood-stain'd arms,</br>To paint meek Charity's unfading charms,</br>Bid gentle Sympathy direct her eyes</br>To those drear haunts where sorrowing Genius lies,</br>And kindred warmth in ev'ry breast infuse,</br>Those ends inspire, exalt, the humblest Muse:</br>A Muse, who, far from vain Ambition's claim,</br>Reluctant treads the dangerous paths of Fame;</br>Yet, call'd to Learning's aid, in Bounty's cause,</br>Still courts, her only meed, the HEART's applause.", "Fir'd at this glorious prospect's bright display,</br>The glad return of this auspicious day,</br>She lifts her voice &mdash; and lo, with heavenly smile,</br>Appear the genuine VIRTUES of our Isle!</br>Bright HONOUR first; whose generous love of fame,</br>Prefers to life itself a spotless name;</br>Ingenuous CONFIDENCE, to Worth allied</br>Who, if she errs, still errs on Candour's side;</br>Plain bold SINCERITY, who firm as true,</br>Prompts the free thought, and bares the heart to view:</br>But chief that gracious heav'n-directed Pow'r,</br>Thy refuge, Grief, in dread Misfortune's hour.</br>BENEVOLENCE, whose blessings unconfin'd,</br>Fill the wide earth &mdash; embrace all human kind.</br>She first inspir'd, she saw with fond delight,</br>This Band in Taste and Learning's aid unite,</br>Smil'd on their hopes, arid call'd, to bless their cause,</br>The GUARDIAN ANGEL of Britannia's laws;</br>That Spirit, who, with firm undaunted zeal,</br>Fills ev'ry heart that seeks the public weal ;</br>That Power shall View, with kind complacent eyes,</br>Redeem'd from Want, neglected Genius rise;</br>Shall hail its friends, shall vindicate their claim</br>To stedfast LOYALTY, to honest Fame ;</br>Who Faction's arts disdain &mdash; her sway disown,</br>But guard a just, paternal, BRUNSWICK'S throne!</br>"]
