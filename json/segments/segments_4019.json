["I sing of the days that are gone,</br>Of Werter who now is no more;</br>Unhappy the hour I was born,</br>His loss I shall ever deplore.</br>The grass that waves high round his tomb,</br>Marks how subject man is to decay;</br>The Monarch must e'en meet his doom:</br>When death calls, ev'n he must obey.", "Since life is uncertain on earth,</br>Ah!  why should I sorrow in vain;</br>The same Pow'r who gave us our birth,</br>Has a right to recall it again.</br>The virtues that dwelt in his breast,</br>Sweet remembrance will ever hold dear;</br>The honour my Werter possess'd,</br>Demands, in soft pity, a tear.", "Oh, could it the Angel restore,</br>Like a fountain it ever should flow;</br>But my Werter, alas!  is no more,</br>And my heart is o'erwhelmed with woe.</br>O give me but strength to retain</br>That goodness that dwelt in his heart;</br>When life shall no longer remain,</br>We shall meet again, never to part.</br>"]
