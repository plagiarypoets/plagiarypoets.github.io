["Since Sipplewell extols the Wooden Spoon</br>In lines as hard and barren as his theme,</br>Why may not I (tho' not as he, Great Bard!</br>So duly qualify'd) attempt to sing</br>The praise of Wooden Head?  Whether of Box,</br>Of Oak Britannic, or exotic plant</br>Yclep'd Mahogony, or humble Ash,</br>Or Schoolboy-honour'd Plumbtree, be thy frame,</br>Hail hollow Block!  whose high Relievo front</br>Triumphant with variety of Wigs,</br>From learned Council's Tye, or Tradesman's Cutt,</br>Down to the Chairman's Caxon, seems to smile</br>As conscious of its use.  Tho' some may boast</br>Their heads replete with patriotic schemes,</br>Or amply lin'd with self-sufficient wit,</br>The quilt of Folly, I will hail thee still;</br>For thou art clear &mdash; Yet thro' thy solid crown</br>What eye can pierce? &mdash; Still let me chaunt thy praise,</br>As to my Wig upon thy surface fix'd,</br>The powder'd Chief applies his skilful aid</br>Benignant, to untwist the various knots,</br>Which blust'ring winds, and congregated rain,</br>Hang on its locks.  The 'Prentice, tho' he trips</br>Along the crowded Mall in Sunday bag,</br>Derives his consequence, O Block, from thee;</br>Oft as the wish'd for Holyday returns,</br>He views the honours of its powder'd curls,</br>And grins with pleasure, as in sneer oblique</br>Each Waiter can attest the known alarm.</br>Lo!  now to Roberts he inclines his steps</br>Affected.  Entring he accosts the Glass</br>With look of satisfaction.  Happy Youth!</br>In Hobby-horse of gilded Gingerbread;</br>Not more the Author of the Wooden Spoon</br>In his long-labour'd Verse; nor more the Man</br>Who to his wish has turn'd the Barber's Block;</br>That block, which asks a modern Poet's brains</br>To give its merit all its praises due.</br>I'll toss it, therefore, to an abler Bard,</br>Whose Head is better turn'd to write on Wood;</br>To Thee, O Sipplewell.</br></p></br></div></br>"]
