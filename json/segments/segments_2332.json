["Why should thy heart grow faint, thy cheek be pale,</br>Why in thine eye should hang the frequent tear,</br>As if the promise of your God would fail,</br>And you and all be left to doubt and fear.</br>Doubt not, for holy men are gathered here;</br>Fear not, for holy thoughts surround the place,</br>And angel pinions hover round, to bear</br>To their bright homes the triumphs of His grace,</br>Whose word all sin and shame, all sorrow shall efface.", "Pure as a Cherub's wishes be thy thought,</br>For in thine ear are heavenly whisperings;</br>And strong thy purposes, as though they sought</br>To do the errand of the King of Kings,</br>And if thy heart be right, his mantle flings</br>Its glorious folds of charity around</br>Thine earthly feelings; and the tuneful strings</br>Of harps in heaven shall vibrate to the sound</br>Of thy soul's prayer from earth, if thou art contrite found.", "Go then, and prosper.  He has promised all&mdash;</br>All that instructed zeal can need or ask;</br>And thou art summon'd with too loud a call,</br>To hesitate and tremble at thy task.</br>Let scoffers, in their glimpse of sunshine bask,</br>And note thy pilgrimage in other light.</br>Their's is a look that peeps but through a mask;</br>Thine is an open path too plain &mdash; too bright</br>For those who doze by day, and see but in the night.</br>"]
