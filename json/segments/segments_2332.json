["If manly sense, and flowing ease,</br>With elegance combin'd,</br>And genius rare have pow'r to please,</br>I, thus, declare my mind&mdash;</br>To alter lines that you have penn'd,</br>Would be to me, what we would mend.", "You soar above all critic rules,</br>With eagle's pinions aid,</br>And leave to dullards and to fools</br>Those shackles they have made:</br>Then let them wear the pressive chain,</br>While you aloft in freedom reign.", "In you, a Shakespeare is reviv'd,</br>In Nature's fine display:</br>Into our bosoms deep you've div'd,</br>And found each leading way,</br>To where each passion keeps its court,</br>And thus our feelings are your sport.", "You sooth, alarm, distress, relieve,</br>With pictures genius drawn.</br>For Nature's Portraits we receive</br>Some trac'd upon thy lawn,</br>The rest, no archetypes we find,</br>Creation form'd them in thy mind.", "In you a Spencer's fancy glows</br>In all her fairy rays:</br>You make our very joys and woes</br>To breathe a being's days:</br>For ev'ry line, the Poet's lyre,</br>Hath kindled with Promethean fire.", "As Milton, you are all sublime.</br>Each line's a daring flight,</br>Amid the highest region clime,</br>That blest a poet's flight.</br>I, therefore, silently adore</br>That merit which I can't praise more.</br>"]
