["Hence!  to thy dark abode again,</br>Faction, foulest fiend of men,</br>What ghastly furies mark'd thy hated birth;</br>Madness, Revenge, and fell Despair,</br>Gloomy discontent was there:</br>\"Be this imp,\" they cried, \"to scourge the subject earth.\"", "Known by thy frenzy-rolling eye,</br>Link'd with the arch fiend Blasphemy,</br>Known by the maniac crew that throng thy side:</br>Before thee rush the dogs of War,</br>Rapine stalks behind thy car,</br>And Desolation spreads her ruin wide.", "Yet oft, each horrid yell between,</br>The placid eye, the look serene,</br>Essays to catch the young unwary breast;</br>The purpose dark, th' infectious guile,</br>Crouch'd beneath the specious smile,</br>And lo!  the dagger's point beneath thy blood-stain'd vest.", "Deaf to the sound of human woe,</br>Thy frozen tears forget to flow;</br>Deaf to the widow's plaint the orphan's cry,</br>What!  tho' flames around thee rise,</br>With a savage joy they glut their eyes,</br>Nor like a hero dost thou heave one sigh.", "Yet 'mid these horrid scenes of blood,</br>Tho' wallowing in the purple flood,</br>Corruption oft hath ply'd her wily art;</br>And when ceas'd the battle's roar,</br>And Delusion's charm was o'er,</br>How hast thou gnaw'd thyself, and torn thy own vile heart.", "Hence, join thy Gallia's panting throng,</br>That raise the democratic song,</br>Waving their red caps, badge of Liberty.</br>Go!  ne'er desert their glorious cause;</br>For thee, they burst all Nature's laws,</br>For thee &mdash; degen'rate race, insulted majesty.", "Yes!  we have watch'd thee hov'ring o'er,</br>Britain's sea-encircled shore,</br>And brooding once upon the main below:</br>But know, th' undaunted lion's power</br>Collected stands in danger's hour,</br>Prepar'd to spring upon his secret foe.", "Know that her tutelary god</br>Vindictive stands, with iron rod,</br>And bares his right red-arm on fiends like thee,</br>And holds Religion's golden shield,</br>To which each pow'r appall'd must yield,</br>To save from thy dread grasp, the isle of Liberty.</br>"]
