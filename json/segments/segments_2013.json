["O for an Angel's voice to swell the theme,</br>That distant worlds might bend the listening ear!</br>A Seraph's lyre to wake Devotion's flame,</br>And warm to Heaven the grateful incense bear!</br>Scatters the cloud at last, in darkness drear,</br>That wrapt the destinies of half the world,</br>Mercy descending dries the bloody tear,</br>The flag of Truth is broad to Heaven unfurl'd,</br>And from his murky throne th' oppressor grim is hurl'd.", "Man, demonised, no more at will shall shake</br>Bambarra's wilds, or Niger's reedy shores;</br>Nor shall the Gambia's weeping Genius quake</br>Beneath the dashing of the white man's oars.</br>For Justice arm'd, with eagle eye explores</br>The tracts where licens'd murder us'd to roam,</br>The fervid soil redundant plenty pours&mdash;</br>Science a ready plans the peaceful home,</br>Where mild affection's flow'rs for ages rich may bloom.", "What though the seed, an handful in the earth,</br>Lonely afar by feeble hands be sown,</br>Like trees of Lebanon it shall spring forth,</br>And prosperous fruit the holy act shall crown.</br>On yonder cliffs, where huge, with sullen frown</br>The tempest shook the daring Gama's breast,</br>A little cloud of heavenly dew sent down,</br>Begins with balmy influence to rest,</br>And cheer'd for many a mile, smiles gay th' expectant waste.", "Barca's dry sands, and thirsty Zaara drear</br>Of Bethle'm's stream shall drink.  The soothing sound</br>The mountains of the Moon shall stoop to hear,</br>And Atlas smile, with leafy verdure crown'd.</br>Then WILBERFORCE, thy name shall far be found</br>Embalm'd with Prophets and Apostles old,</br>While grateful Africa, the world around,</br>The sacred flag of freedom shall unfold,</br>Where high Britannia's name emblazon'd flames in gold.</br>"]
