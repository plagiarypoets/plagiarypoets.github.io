["The bark departs &mdash; but still within our view,</br>The russet roof, or glitt'ring steeple bright,</br>Seem lengthen'd shadows on the sky of blue,</br>And gradual dark'ning hover on our sight:&mdash;</br>Yet serve with momentary glance to give,</br>A ling'ring, longing glimpse of spot well known;</br>Where some lov'd friends, or beauteous maiden live,</br>A youthful bud and scarce in ripeness blown;</br>Blent with the glance a wish to call that bud thy own.", "The bark departs &mdash; but not to eye is given,</br>To scan the scene our former glances told:</br>Sinks in horizon bounding earth and heaven,</br>Gay roofs and towering steeples burnish'd gold;</br>Yet not the thought; &mdash; on mem'ry moulded deep,</br>The sweet impression's there for ever borne:</br>Oh!  if thou lov'st, wakeful or in thy sleep,</br>Of parting scenes the sweeten'd thoughts return!</br>Ne'er let thy precious treasure from thy soul be torn.", "But ah!  with them in fashion's round,</br>Quickly you're flatter'd, then as quick forgot;</br>Beneath their smiles more graceful faces bound,</br>In Lethe's depths, you quickly are forgot.</br>A picture true mark yonder sparkling wave,</br>Flashing the silv'ry globules of its crest;</br>Plays round the vessel's bow, its timbers leave,</br>Rebounding gradual falls and strikes to rest;</br>Is soon replac'd by one as bright in sparkles drest.</br>"]
