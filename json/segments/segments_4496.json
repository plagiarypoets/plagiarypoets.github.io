["How swiftly the moments did pass,</br>And the minutes they all seem'd to fly,</br>Whilst I sat by my favourite Lass;</br>But she's gone, and with grief I could die.</br>Alas!  my poor heart it will break,</br>For no comfort or peace can I find;</br>I only can live for her sake,</br>And she ne'er shall be out of my mind.", "Oh!  let her not ever forget</br>How with transport I view'd her all day,</br>How pleas'd by her side I did sit,</br>And the thousand fond things I did say.</br>I know her kind heart won't disdain</br>To pity a grief she can't heal;</br>Could she give relief to my pain,</br>Then no longer that pain should I feel.", "But perhaps I mistaken may be,</br>And perhaps she no pity will give,</br>But, indiff'rent, ne'er wishes to see</br>Or to hear if I die or I live.</br>'Tis wrong to expect or desire</br>My fond love she should ever return;</br>For the Fates do against me conspire,</br>Yet with passion I ever shall burn.</br>"]
