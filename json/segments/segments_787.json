["This is the day, fair LYDIA'S natal day,</br>When my impotent Muse would strike the lyre,</br>The long half-sleeping lyre assume the lay,</br>And sing her matchless charms with glowing fire:</br>Nor think, fair LYDIA, that she flatt'ry joins,</br>To swell her feeble verse, and empty sounding lines.", "Sure worth like thine a loftier Muse requires,</br>Far nobler strains should thy desert proclaim;</br>For ev'ry virtue, ev'ry grace conspires,</br>To raise thy merit, and extol thy fame,</br>Thy beauty, equall'd only by the charms</br>Thy mind diffuses round, and ev'ry bosom warms.", "Adorn'd with ev'ry noble &mdash; useful art,</br>That adds bright lustre to the female form,</br>Plain truth, and genuine goodness warm thy heart,</br>Thy chearful smile would fiercest rage disarm:</br>These, these are ornaments which never fade,</br>Unsullied these remain, when Beauty's charms are fled.", "Thy presence, now, makes glad this happy plain,</br>Far from the haunts of Luxury and Pride,</br>Where chearful Mirth, and social Converse reign,</br>Where smiling Plenty swells the jovial tide:</br>Where first the sun's enliv'ning beams did shine,</br>On LYDIA'S beauteous form, with energy divine.", "The circling year rolls on with rapid speed,</br>The fleeting moments fly; this happy day</br>Will soon be past, another soon succeed,</br>When added lustre thou shalt then display:</br>A loftier Muse shall then thy virtues sing,</br>For ever blooming fresh with an eternal spring.</br>"]
