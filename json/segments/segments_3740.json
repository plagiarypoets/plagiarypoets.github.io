["A delicate pinch!  oh how it tingles up</br>The titillated nose, and fills the eyes</br>And breast, till in one comfortable sneeze,</br>The full collected pleasure bursts at last!</br>Most rare COLUMBUS!  Thou shalt be for this,</br>The only CHRISTOPHER in my calendar!</br>Why, but for thee, the uses of the nose</br>Were half unknown, and its capacity</br>Of joy.  The summer gale, that from the heath</br>At mid noon glittering with the golden furze,</br>Rears its balsamic odor, but provokes,</br>Not satisfies the sense; and all the flowers</br>That with their unsubstantial fragrance tempt</br>And disappoint, bloom for so short a space</br>That half the year the nostrils keep Lent,</br>But that the kind Tobacconist admits</br>No winter in his work; when Nature sleeps</br>His wheels roll on, and still administer</br>A plenitude of smell, a tangible joy.</br>What is Peru and those Brazillian mines,</br>To thee Virginia?  Those unhappy realms</br>That furnish gold for knaves, and gems for fools!</br>But thine are common comforts &mdash; to omit</br>Pipe-panegyric and tobacco-praise,</br>Think but what gen'ral joy the snuff box gives,</br>Europe, and in thy benefactors' roll</br>Above PIZARRO write our RALEIGH'S name.</br>Him let the sage Apothecary bless,</br>When sorely puzzl'd by perplexing ease</br>He rears between his knees his gold-tipt cane,</br>Takes snuff like a Physician, and looks wise.</br>Him let the school-boy bless, for when he sees</br>The thumb and finger of authority</br>Stuft up the nostrils; when hat, head and wig</br>All shake; when on the waistcoat black the dust,</br>Or drop falls brown, soon shall the brow severe</br>Relax, and from vituperative lips</br>Words that of birds remind not, sounds of praise,</br>And jokes, that must be laugh'd at, still proceed.</br>"]
