["While in the sky black clouds impend,</br>And fogs arise, and rains descend,</br>And one brown prospect opens round</br>Of leafless trees, and furrow'd ground;</br>Save where unmelted spots of snow</br>Upon the shaded hill-side show;</br>While chill winds blow, and torrents roll,</br>The scene disgusts the sight, depresses all the soul.", "Yet worse what polar climates share&mdash;</br>Vast regions, dreary, bleak, and bare!</br>There, on an icy mountain's height,</br>Seen only by the moon's pale light,</br>Stern Winter rears his giant form,</br>His robe a mist, his voice a storm;</br>His frown the shivering nations fly,</br>And hid, for half the year, in smoky caverns lie.", "Yet there the lamp's perpetual blaze</br>Can pierce the gloom with chearing rays;</br>Yet there the heroic tale or song</br>Can urge the lingering hours along;</br>Yet there their hands, with timely care,</br>The kajak and the dart prepare,</br>On Summer seas to work their way,</br>And wage the watry war, and make the seals their prey.", "Too delicate!  reproach no more</br>The seasons of thy native shore;</br>There soon shall Spring descend the sky,</br>With smiling brow, and placid eye;</br>A primrose wreath surrounds her hair,</br>Her green robe floats upon the air;</br>And, scatter'd from her liberal hand,</br>Fair blossoms deck the trees, fair flowers adorn the land.</br>"]
