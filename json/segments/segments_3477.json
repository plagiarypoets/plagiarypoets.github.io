["Again imperial Winter's Sway,</br>The Laureat bids his Ode display;</br>Throws o'er his torpid Brains his icy Bar,</br>And makes him sing of hostile Lakes and War.</br>O may it ne'er revive! &mdash; Ye Kings,</br>Whose Bounty gives the But of Sack,</br>For which our Bays-crown'd Bard like Colley sings,</br>Lay not that Burthen on his Back.", "Enough, enough of New Year Odes we've known,</br>O, Whitehead, Laureat of these Northern Climes;</br>For you we heave the Kindred Groan,</br>We pity your Misfortune and your Rhimes.</br>Stop, stop th' exhausted Verse,</br>And other Strains rehearse;</br>Or rather hear a Parent's dear Request,</br>For Dullness longs to sleep, and clasp thee to her Breast.", "Some Change we do require &mdash; some Form</br>Ideal that may float on Fancy's Sky.</br>Let Genius break the drowsy Charm,</br>And glance from Earth to Heav'n with Eagle Eye:</br>For not on New Year Odes alone</br>Did Poetry e'er fix her Throne.</br>There Dullness undisturb'd her Rule maintains,</br>Can Poetry be found where that cold Tyrant reigns?", "Then let thy dismal Ditties henceforth cease;</br>Drink Sack, and wear the Bays in Peace.</br>Thus all thy Nonsense ill express'd</br>Will slumber in eternal Rest,</br>And Folly's heedless Sons no more</br>Will gape at what they've read before;</br>But all lie buried in Oblivion's Flood,</br>For thy great Comfort and the Public Good.</br>"]
