["Let other bards of more ambitious views,</br>Extend their thoughts, and grander subjects chuse.</br>For me, I meditate no lofty pitch,</br>Nor aim at quarry far above my reach.</br>My theme to ev'ry bard may well belong,</br>Yet is forgot, and still remains unsung.</br>Frogs, mice, and gnats, their battles and their praise</br>Have been recorded in immortal lays.</br>A splendid shilling in poetic lines</br>Improves it's worth, and with more lustre shines.</br>Hoops, buckets, pigmies, puppets, locks and fans,</br>Have been commended, by no vulgar pens.</br>But I no trivial arguments rehearse,</br>The grey goose-quill shall grace my humble verse.</br>Who do's not plain see the various aid</br>The quill imparts to men of ev'ry trade?</br>What art, what bus'ness can you take in hand,</br>That do's not her assistances demand?</br>From the high statesman, to the lowest clown,</br>All her peculiar benefits must own;</br>But scholars most of all (good scholars) will</br>For ever speak in raptures of the quill.</br>The swans of old, for some mistaken cause,</br>The poets always mention with applause.</br>Maeander's banks were honour'd with their songs</br>They shar'd that praise that now to geese belongs.</br>To geese the haughty swans wou'd give no place</br>For \"inter anseres\" was a disgrace.</br>But lest I partial seem to judge the fray,</br>Hear what the feather'd orators can say.</br>Thou screamer, says the swan, of gaggling race,</br>Amongst us swans how durst thou show thy face?</br>Our praises dwell on ev'ry poet's tongue,</br>Renown'd for beauty, and renown'd for song.</br>The greatest geniuses of Rome and Greece,</br>Extolling swans have meanly spoke of geese.</br>Ev'n to a proverb, in contempt's your name,</br>For goose and fool now signify the same.</br>Vain bird!  replies the goose, I scorn thy ways,</br>To be so fond of false and fulsome praise.</br>Beyond decorum you assert your right,</br>Is nothing beautiful, but what is white?</br>Do poets say you sing?  what's more absurd?</br>And yet you take the flatt'ring poets word.</br>Weak, silly minds by flatt'ry are betray'd,</br>Of wisdom then let not your boast be made.</br>But we, whom you despise, with just pretence</br>May claim the patronage of men of sense.</br>Do's not antiquity our worth extol?</br>Manlius, and we preserv'd Rome's capitol.</br>Our wings support old Homer's deathless name,</br>And aided Milton in his rise to fame.</br>Upon our pinions bold Historians soar,</br>And Nat'ralists abstrusest things explore.</br>Self-praise sometimes befits a modest tongue,</br>When calumny and spite have done us wrong.</br>My quills have toil'd to gain a merchant wealth,</br>And wrote a thousand recipes for health.</br>What parchment-skins have they not copy'd o'er</br>To make mens rights and properties secure?</br>In pious writings they no pains refuse,</br>But trace the paths to long celestial joys.</br>By them the virtuous lover does impart</br>The soft, engaging dictates of his heart.</br>By them the yielding nymph replies again,</br>And without blushing owns her faithful swain.</br>These favours, tho' she do's not dying sing,</br>The geese contributes from her useful wing.</br>Nor do's she beg the boon of flatt'ring verse,</br>Her real worth, and merit to rehearse.</br>From Chaucer's times to these our present days,</br>The grey goose-quill was ever held in praise.</br>And, if that verse eternity can give,</br>Its name and honours shall for ever live.</br>"]
