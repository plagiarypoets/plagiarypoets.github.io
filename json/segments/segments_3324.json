["PASTORA AND GALATEA.", "Beneath the umbrageous shadow of a shade,</br>Where glowing foliage on the surface play'd,</br>And golden roses fann'd the silver breeze,</br>In many a maze light echoing through the trees,</br>Pastora tun'd the sweetly-panting string,</br>And ruddy notes thus wak'd the flattering spring;</br>While from th' alternate margin of an oak,</br>A woodland Naiad thus meandring spoke.", "PASTORA.</br>The reed disports upon the sounding thorn,</br>And Philomel salutes the noon-tide morn,</br>The buzzing bees, poetic from their hive,</br>In smooth alliteration seem alive:</br>But ah!  my virgin swain is chaster far</br>Then Cupid's painted shafts, or sparrows are;</br>Sparrows that perch, like Sappho's, on my lay,</br>Or hop in concert with the dancing day.", "GALATEA.</br>What sound was that, which dawn'd a bleating hue,</br>And blush'd a sigh?  Pastora, was it you?</br>Your notes, sweet maid, thus proverb still shall foil,</br>\"The pot that's watch'd was never known to boil.\"", "PASTORA.</br>Ah, no!  whate'er thou art, or sigh, or word,</br>Or golden water fam'd, or talking bird;</br>Source of my joy, or genius of my notes,</br>Or Ocean's landscape stampt with lyric boats,</br>Ah, no!  far hence thy aromatic strains</br>Recoil, and beautify our vaulted plains.", "GALATEA.</br>Thy dazzling harmony affects me so,</br>In azure symmetry I sigh &mdash; ah, no!</br>Ah, no!  ah, no!  the woods irradiate sing,</br>Ah, no!  ah, no!  for joy the grottoes ring;</br>E'en Heraclitus' vocal tears would flow,</br>To hear thee murmur thy melodious No!</br>Thy voice, 'tis true, Pastora, gilds the sky,</br>But woods and grottoes flutter in my eye.", "PASTORA.</br>When night pellucid warbles into day,</br>And morn sonorous floats upon the May,</br>With well-blown bugle through the wilds of air</br>I roam accordant, while the bounding hare</br>In covert claps her wings, to see me pass</br>Ethereal meadows of transparent grass.", "GALATEA.</br>Magnetic thunders now illume the air,</br>And fragrant music variegates the year.</br>Light trips the dolphin through cerulean woods,</br>And spotless tygers harmonize the floods;</br>Ev'n Thetis smooths her brow, and laughs to see</br>Kind nature weep, in symphony with me.", "PASTORA.</br>This young conundrum let me first propose,</br>It puzzles half our dainty belles and beaux.</br>What makes my lays, in blue-ey'd order shine</br>So far superior, when compar'd with thine?", "GALATEA.</br>Expound me this, and I'll disclaim the prize,</br>Whose lustre blushes with Peruvian dyes.</br>When crowing foxes whistle in their dens,</br>Or radiant hornpipes dance to cocks and hens,</br>What makes sly Reynard and his cackling mate,</br>That sav'd the capitol, resign to fate?", "PASTORA.</br>But see, Aquarius fills his ample vase,</br>And Taurus warbles to Vitruvian laws:</br>So, crab-like Cancer all her speed assumes,</br>And Virgo, still a maid, elastic blooms.</br>My rose-lipt ewes in mystic wonder stand</br>To hear me sing, and court my conscious hand.</br>Adieu, my goats; for ne'er shall rural muse</br>Your philosophic beards to stroke refuse.</br>"]
