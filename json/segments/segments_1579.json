["Come! &mdash; in thy flowing locks and artless dress,</br>More beauteous than the poet Venus shews;</br>Thy genuine feelings let thy tongue express,</br>Since candour in thy bosom ever glows;</br>Come! &mdash; and in open day assert thy right</br>Man to reform, to polish, and delight.", "She comes! &mdash; a blaze of glory decks the scene;</br>Congenial virtues on her steps attend;</br>Graceful her form, her countenance serene;</br>Her great design our morals to attend:</br>On truth's mild brows she fixes honour's crown,</br>Whilst vice and folly tremble at her frown.", "Falsehood retires, his pallid cheeks declare</br>The deep remorse which preys upon his heart;</br>The gentle soother of the good and fair</br>Tears from his brow the insidious mask of art.</br>That rage is shewn, which lurked within his breast,</br>And the detested monster stands confess'd.", "Ah!  whence that shriek? &mdash; It vibrates on my ear,</br>More loudly than the thunder's awful peal&mdash;</br>But now my bosom is reliev'd from fear,</br>Since scandal is in turn compell'd to feel</br>Grief and distress &mdash; She seems to sink to hell,</br>There with congenial fiends condemned to dwell.", "Merit steps forth; his ready hand is grasped,</br>By the mild dame, who fondly owns her heir;</br>Religion in her strict embrace is clasped,</br>And in her smiles each art and science share.</br>Genius appears, in native radiance bright,</br>Hails the blest power, and mingles light with light.", "Guide of my youth, to thee I ever bow'd;</br>Whate'er my follies, still I ow'd thy sway:</br>I scorned the mean, insidious, flattering crowd;</br>Intent to thee my purest vows to pay.</br>Sincerity!  still o'er my breast preside;</br>My boast on earth! &mdash; to heaven, I trust, my guide!</br>"]
