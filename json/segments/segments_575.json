["While others pay their tribute due,</br>In foreign verse, and tongues unknown,</br>My humbler Muse resorts to you,</br>And strives to pay it in her own.</br>Unskill'd in each poetic grace,</br>Unknowing of the tuneful art,</br>She gives the little all she has,</br>A simple English verse, an honest English heart.", "Oh!  when thou read'st it, let thine eyes</br>Awhile with tears forget to flow;</br>Thy beauteous bosom cease to rise,</br>And labour with its weight of woe.</br>Why should'st thou thus the monarch's death</br>With unavailing grief deplore?</br>Canst thou recall the fleeting breath?</br>No &mdash; thou must lose thy own, but canst not his restore.", "Then dry thy tears &mdash; the God of day,</br>Though flowers now hide him from our sight,</br>Soon through the darkness works his way,</br>And moves in all the pomp of light.</br>Like him, O lift thy radiant eyes,</br>Like him with gracious influence shine;</br>Think from thy joys that ours arise,</br>Consider England's happiness depends on thine.", "Hear then thy people's, husband's prayers;</br>He bids thee too dismiss thy grief:</br>What, shall he only meet with care,</br>Where he expects to find relief?</br>Beneath the weight of crowns oppresst,</br>He to thy love for ease does flee;</br>When he has given his kingdoms rest,</br>Retreats into thy arms, and finds his own in thee.", "O Caroline, our sweetest grace,</br>Delight and pleasure of our eyes,</br>Thou fruitful mother of our peace,</br>Thou source whence all our joys arise;</br>Blest in thy numerous offspring, lo!</br>A rising age of gold we see;</br>The people shall not only owe</br>Their present bliss, but all their future too, to thee.", "Britannia, leave thy mournful bed,</br>Raise up thy prostrate limbs from earth,</br>Exalt aloft thy towery head,</br>And see what joys are taking birth;</br>See how the smiling years succeed,</br>Behold the blessings laid in store:</br>What though thou mourn'st thy monarch dead,</br>Look on the branches he has left, and thou wilt weep no more.", "With rapture view the lovely race,</br>See future kings and queens arise,</br>Thy throne hereafter born to grace,</br>And bless th' admiring people's eyes:</br>Sons &mdash; that already pant for fame,</br>Fir'd with their father's love of arms;</br>Bright daughters &mdash; form'd in beauty's frame,</br>And lavishly adorn'd with all their mother's charms.", "Oh!  with what pleasure now we may</br>To latest times extend our sight!</br>The nation's rising bliss survey,</br>And see new glories spring to light!</br>Succeeding years of joy and peace</br>T' our children boldly we presage;</br>Ev'n now we taste their happiness,</br>And, in this instant moment, live the future age.", "Thus, when the great Aeneas view'd</br>The destin'd heroes of his race,</br>Fix'd in astonishment, he stood,</br>To see the bright succession pass.</br>The thoughts of vast events to come</br>Within his labouring fancy roll;</br>The triumphs of immortal Rome,</br>And all her shining glories, kindle in his soul.", "Pleas'd, he enjoys the beauteous scene,</br>Proudly exulting in his mind,</br>Counts o'er the forms of godlike men,</br>For empire, and for life, design'd:</br>Then, wrapp'd in ecstasy, he stands,</br>To see in them his Troy revive;</br>Their birth, with eagerness, demands,</br>And wishes ev'n to die, that they may sooner live.</br>"]
