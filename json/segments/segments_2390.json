["Fox to whose lot hath fall'n a favorite name&mdash;</br>A Name to social worth and freedom dear,</br>Shall not this day's return some mem'ry claim</br>Which thee, with all thy woes and cares, left here?</br>Much hadst thou suffer'd in thy youthful prime</br>And man had been thy foe, worse than to others, time.", "Thy cares, thy fears, are gone: &mdash; and never more</br>May they return upon thy gentle head!</br>Nor food and shelter thy faint eye implore</br>Doubtful, nor chill thy trembling limbs bespread</br>In agony and dread, from hopeless flight,</br>As when thy quivering life here caught the pitying sight", "Of her who still protects thee! &mdash; Taxes come!</br>Unkind to thee, and thy deserving race,</br>Of dogs and men PITT little heeds the doom.</br>But thee, nor tax, nor aught more dire displace.</br>E'en should invasion come, safe be thou still!</br>And none do ill to thee, who dost to nothing ill!</br>"]
