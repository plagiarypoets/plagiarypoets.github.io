["Oh hear the sad nightingale mourn</br>In the grove that I planted hard by,</br>She grieves for her innocence torn,</br>As for my lost treasure do I.</br>Ah see!  how with freedom elate,</br>My lambkins, they frolic and play,</br>Time was, nor far distant the date,</br>When I was as happy as they.", "When Phyllida, first of her train,</br>In beauty of person and mind,</br>Rejected each love-stricken swain,</br>And prov'd to her Corydon kind,</br>How jocund the time flew away,</br>When the sweet marriage knot it was tied,</br>But how sad, and how luckless the day,</br>When Phyllida sickened and died.", "I remember it all with regret,</br>'Twas a day of most sorrowful date,</br>The sun did in gloominess set,</br>And the heavens did weep at my fate.</br>The heavens did weep, it is true,</br>And water my Phyllida's bier,</br>But not so could Corydon do,</br>For his heart was too full for a tear.", "Long time the cold earth was the bed,</br>On which my sad limbs I have laid,</br>And the flocks which I often have fed,</br>To their folds untended have stray'd.</br>Oh haste, my fond lambkins, away,</br>And leave me to weep and to die,</br>Some other kind shepherd obey,</br>A shepherd much kinder than I.", "But how useless the tears that I shed!</br>Why thus should I mourn and complain?</br>For Phyllida's spirit is fled,</br>And sorrow's petition is vain.</br>She has left me all sad and forlorn,</br>Hard lessons of sorrow to learn,</br>To weep for the days that are gone,</br>Those days that will never return.", "To my cot, my sad cot I'll repair,</br>Where roses entwine round the door,</br>Oft water'd by Phyllida's care,</br>But now to be water'd no more.</br>I'll take leave of my desolate cot,</br>Or my brain it will madden and burn,</br>I'll hastily quite the sad spot,</br>I'll quit it, nor ever return.", "To the woods, the wild woods, I'll retire,</br>And strive my lost peace to redeem,</br>I'll feed on the fruits of the briar,</br>And drink of the rivulet's stream.</br>I'll wander in sorrow alone,</br>Yet no &mdash; not so lonely my fate,</br>For I'll teach the wood-pigeon to moan,</br>As tho' it did moan for its mate.", "Sad echo shall often repeat,</br>That Corydon's quiet is fled,</br>And every object I meet</br>Shall learn that my Phyllida's dead.</br>Farewell then my flocks, and my cot,</br>By the dawn of the day I will flee,</br>I will flee to some desolate spot,</br>A spot made for sorrow and me.</br>"]
