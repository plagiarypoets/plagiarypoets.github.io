["Is it true that Eliza, no more,</br>By her presence our fields will adorn?</br>Has she gone, and left me to deplore,</br>The dear object, I ever must mourn?</br>Yes indeed!  the sad tidings are true,</br>For, their truth, my soul's anguish declares,</br>To our vales she had bidden adieu,</br>And resisted the tenderest pray'rs.", "For Eliza I search in the grove,</br>Or along by the rivulet's side,</br>O'er the meadow of willows I rove,</br>And thro' close-woven thickets I glide.</br>In her favourite walks now I roam,</br>Now reecho the woods with her name,</br>Kind relief then I seek for at home,</br>But my sorrow continues the same.", "I'll encircle my temples with green,</br>On my bosom green leaves will I wear,</br>Not a colour but that shall be seen,</br>'Tis the emblem of deepest despair.</br>All lamenting, I know is in vain,</br>Yet I can't but give vent to my grief,</br>'Tis a soothing of wo, to complain,</br>That affords me a transient relief.</br>"]
