["When Scotia's hills with drifted snow are clad,</br>And lowering clouds obstruct the beams of day;&mdash;</br>When the chill north wind whistles bleak and sad,</br>And Nature shrinks &mdash; prophetic of decay:</br>Why does the mountaineer regardless stray,</br>And, wrapping close his plaid of varied dye,</br>Proudly from Grampian height the scene survey?</br>Thy charms, O gracious Liberty!  supply</br>Health to his manly cheek, and rapture to his eye!", "Daughter of heaven!  where'er thy downy wing,</br>In joyful flight sweeps o'er the plains below,</br>A thousand odours forth thy pinions fling;</br>Beneath thy feet a thousand roses grow:</br>With thee the savage, who, with bended bow,</br>Roams the vast wild and draws the deadly string,</br>Will on his back the dying panther throw,</br>To his lone cave, well pleased, the victim bring,</br>Gaze o'er his vast domains, and think himself a king.", "O who could slumber when the bugle strain,</br>To join th' embattled ranks thy votaries bade!</br>'Mid Britain's sons I trow the search were vain,</br>For ne'er did Briton pause to draw his blade,</br>When tyranny his iron sceptre swayed:</br>Nor for themselves alone, have vengeance hurled,&mdash;</br>Gallia shall blush to view a highland plaid,</br>And see, triumphant still, that flag unfurled,</br>That bought, at WATERLOO, the FREEDOM of the world.</br>"]
