["Fret not thy self, thou man of modern song,</br>That thou'rt confin'd, and eke thy cheek is sore;</br>Nor pining say, the Fates have done thee wrong;</br>Mischance like this has hap'd to bards of yore,</br>And shall to future bards, till time shall be no more!</br>Behold thy Ann (of all that's good the best)</br>Of virgin charms displaying matchless store,</br>Pillows thy head upon her snow-white breast,</br>And looks of love shall lull thy sorrowing soul to rest!</br>"]
