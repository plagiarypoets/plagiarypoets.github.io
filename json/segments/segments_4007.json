["Near yonder gate, the entrance to a wood,</br>\"The village preacher's modest mansion stood.</br>A man he was\" who own'd religion's sway;</br>Unlike the pastors of the present day.</br>No worldly gain was he e'er taught to prize;</br>His motive virtue, and his aim the skies.</br>With doctrines sound his audience' souls he reached;</br>\"And, strange to tell, he practic'd what he preach'd.\"</br>When the poor beggar for assistance pray'd,</br>His friendly arm their wretched wand'ring staid.</br>No suppliant's prayer e'er pass'd unheeded by:</br>Tear answer'd tear, and sigh succeeded sigh.</br>Altho' no lover of the strolling race,</br>As pity call'd he heard each dubious case;</br>If false dismiss'd them from his grateful fare,</br>Since Misery only gain'd admittance there.</br>But if their story, told devoid of art,</br>Without a colouring reach'd the tender heart,</br>Then with what love, what eagerness, what zeal,</br>He strove their sorrows, sicknesses to heal;</br>Declar'd the means to bear affliction's rod,</br>And taught subjection to the will of God.</br>When e'er his parish from their duty swerv'd,</br>Their passions, vices, inclinations serv'd,</br>He with a care paternal urg'd reclaim,</br>In just proportion to his generous aim;</br>Argued from reason's, that from scripture's laws;</br>A great defender of a greater cause!</br>When sickness rag'd, from door to door he went,</br>His aid to all with equal pleasure lent:</br>With love benign administer'd relief,</br>And truly joy'd to mitigate their grief.</br>As to these duties, so to others true,&mdash;</br>His every action like the notic'd few;</br>Free from ambition, envy, pride, or strife,</br>He pass'd in solitude &mdash; a godly life:</br>Till death approaching led his soul away</br>From dreary regions &mdash; to eternal day.</br>"]
