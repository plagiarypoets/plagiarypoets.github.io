["Ye rivers so limpid and clear,</br>Who reflect, as in cadence you flow,</br>All the beauties that vary the year,</br>All the flow'rs on your margins that grow!</br>How blest on your banks could I dwell,</br>Were Melissa the pleasure to share,</br>And teach your sweet echoes to tell</br>With what fondness I doat on the fair!", "Ye harvests that wave in the breeze</br>As far as the view can extend!</br>Ye mountains, umbrageous with trees,</br>Whose tops so majestic ascend!</br>Your landscape what joy to survey,</br>Were Melissa with me to admire!</br>Then the harvest would glitter, how gay,</br>How majestic the mountains aspire!", "In pensive regret, whilst I rove,</br>The fragrance of flow'rs to inhale;</br>Or watch from the pastures and grove,</br>Each music that floats on the gale.</br>Alas!  the delusion how vain!</br>Nor odours nor harmony please</br>A heart agonizing with pain,</br>Which tries every posture for ease.", "If anxious to flatter my woes,</br>Or the languor of absence to chear,</br>Her breath I would catch in the rose,</br>Or her voice in the nightingale hear:</br>To cheat my despair of its prey,</br>What object her charms can assume?</br>How harsh is the nightingale's lay,</br>How insipid the rose's perfume?", "Ye zephyrs that visit my fair,</br>Ye sun-beams around her that play,</br>Does her sympathy dwell on my care?</br>Does she number the hours of my stay?</br>First perish ambition and wealth,</br>First perish all else that is dear,</br>Ere one sigh should escape her by stealth,</br>Ere my absence should cost her one tear.", "When, when shall her beauties once more</br>This desolate bosom surprise?</br>Ye Fates!  the blest moments restore</br>When I bask'd in the beams of her eyes;</br>When, with sweet emulation of heart,</br>Our kindness we struggled to show;</br>But the more that we strove to impart,</br>We felt it more ardently glow.</br>"]
