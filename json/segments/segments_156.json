["When Perseus bride, that starre of heaven had fled</br>The Dragons paw by helpe of Gorgons head,</br>And on the sea-gods golden-edged brim</br>Her gold-out-glistering lockes began to trim:</br>Then did the lustie Ram with horned crest</br>Rouse up Europas grim-curl'd headed beast,</br>Who loudly bellowing did chase away</br>The tedious night, and call'd backe cheerefull day.</br>For then Hyperions son, the daies bright king</br>In pompe did court the Ladie of the spring;</br>And she againe in all her rich aray</br>Did wanton with him in lascivious play,</br>Untill her wombe with loves sweet fruit did grow,</br>The sweetest fruit, that wombe did ever grow:</br>For it brought forth the worlds admired birth,</br>The faire dame Flora, fairest child on earth;</br>Who in short time did grow so great in fame</br>For needle worke, that never any dame,</br>Although her cunning were exceeding rare</br>With faire dame Floraes skill might make compare:</br>To show the which, the world she set on wing</br>Of sweet delight, to welcome in the spring:</br>The moyntaine tops she clad in coate of greene.</br>And spotted them with gold as they had been</br>Starrie Olympi; and the vales below</br>She deckt with daintier worke, then art can show;</br>Upon the ground mantled in verdent hew,</br>Out of her fruitfull lap each day she threw,</br>The choicest flowers, that any curious eye</br>In natures garden ever did espie:</br>The loftie trees, whose leavie lockes did shake</br>And with the wind did daliance seeme to make,</br>Shee with sweet breathing blossomes did adorne,</br>That seem'd to laugh the winter past to scorne,</br>Who when mild Zephirus did gently blow</br>Delightfull odors round about did throw;</br>While joyous birds beneath the leavie shade,</br>With pleasant singing sweet respondence made</br>Unto the murmuring streames, that seem'd to play</br>With silver shels, that in their bosom lay:</br>Thus with delight did Flora decke each thing</br>To welcome in her mother joyfull spring,</br>Who had not long triumph'd in this our clime</br>Before the tidings of her joyous prime</br>Were spread abroad, which, when those birds that shrunke</br>Into the wooden walles of hollow trunck,</br>For truth did heare, abroad they boldly came</br>To welcome Lady Ver, that lovely dame</br>Mong'st whom two chiefe there were, Dan Cuckow hight;</br>In whom god Vulcans love tooke most delight,</br>The other that sweet singer Philomel,</br>Or Casta hight, whom Phoebe loved well:</br>These two were chiefe, that in contention stood</br>Amongst the pleasant singers of the wood</br>To be chiefe carroler and lead the ring,</br>Of all the rest to welcome in the spring.</br>Dan Cuckow was a bird hatcht in that houre,</br>When Mars did sport in Cythereas bowre,</br>Whereby the note, which his hoarse voice doth beare</br>Is harsh and fatall to the wedded eare:</br>But little Philomela farre more blest</br>Was foster'd in faire Phoebes owne deare brest,</br>Whom she no more the Nightingale did name;</br>But to consort her nature to the same</br>Shee call'd her Casta, word of much import,</br>And made her chiefe of birds in their confort.</br>Betwixt Dan Cuckow and this little bird</br>Th' approach of spring a great contention stird,</br>Who should be deem'd the chiefe of birds to bring</br>The happie tidings of th' approaching spring:</br>For Philomel once in a pearlie morne,</br>When heaven with sun-bright lookes did earth adorne</br>Hearing each bird record her curious lay,</br>Unto the wood with speed did take her way,</br>Where shee did presse into the thickest throng</br>And did so sweetly in delicious song</br>Chaunt out aloude her welcome to the spring,</br>That all the birds did cease to heare her sing:</br>But as she sate admir'd of every one,</br>Redoubling quavers in division,</br>And sweetly warbling out that chastest song,</br>Which Phoebe taught to her when shee was young,</br>Dan Cuckow came, and from his greedie throate</br>Breathing out ditties of an unchast note,</br>As wroth that other birds should seeke to make</br>Her mistres of the quier, thus boldly spake:</br>Thou wretch (said he) what high aspiring spirit</br>Doth harbor in thy brest?  what is thy merit</br>That thou should'st be chiefe carroler to sing</br>Amongst us all to welcome in the spring?</br>Is not my dame the goddesse of delight,</br>And Queene of Love, whose altars are bedight</br>With broad blowne blossomes of the blooming spring,</br>Of budding youth:  then cease and let mee sing;</br>For I of birds am chiefest in her sight</br>And in my ditties she takes most delight:</br>Then cease thou fondling cease, and let me sing</br>A pleasing welcome to the wanton spring.</br>This said, he chaunted out his wonted lay;</br>Which did in woods all wedded birds affray:</br>But little Casta nought at all dismaide,</br>Being safely shrowded in the leavie shade</br>Return'd this short replie:  (Cuckow) (quoth shee)</br>What thou hast said, I graunt; yet now heare me.</br>Where daintie dames are dight to wanton fin</br>Loosely arraid youths wandring eyes to win,</br>Whom slick-hair'd slipper-losels do dispoile</br>Of beauties, bud with loves sweete seeming toile,</br>While smock sworne boyes stand by and keepe account,</br>How oft aloft they lustily do mount;</br>There with good right may thy harsh sounding throate</br>Without controll record thy bastard note.</br>But in all woods, where my faire virgin dame</br>With her chaste Nymphes did keepe laborious game</br>To slacke the strength of loves bow-bending string,</br>Thou must not speake thy welcome to the spring:</br>For Phoebes selfe with all her Nymphes consent</br>Did make me cheefe of birds, for that intent.</br>This said, Dan Cuckow perfect in the sleight</br>Of cunning guile, and knowing loves delight</br>Had thrill'd their hearts, that in faire Phoebes grove</br>Once rang'd at will in scorne of Ladie love,</br>Made this replie:  (quoth he) seeing thou dost vaunt</br>Of Phoebe and her Nymphes, thereby to daunt</br>My courage in this claime, I do agree,</br>That they decide the cause 'twixt thee and mee;</br>And if they judge thy note the sweeter sound,</br>Cheefe singer of the quier, thou shalt be crown'd:</br>But if to them my song more pleasing be,</br>To make me cheefe in woods, thou shalt agree.</br>Casta being swift to give such counsell eare</br>Supposing Phoebes Nymphes, such love did beare</br>To chaster thoughts, that they would all detect</br>The unchaste dittie of Dan Cuckowes brest,</br>Was well contented that it should be so</br>And with Dan Cuckow for this cause did go,</br>Unto the bower of blisse, for so it hight,</br>Where then those Nymphes to be did most delight.</br>It is a place, that thoughts cannot devise</br>A plot more like unto a Paradise;</br>Shall I compare it to Cytheron greene,</br>On which the warre-god did compresse loves queene,</br>Or to Adonis garden farre renown'd,</br>In which eternall spring is ever found,</br>O farre more pleasant is this pleasant place,</br>Then all the blisfull bowers beneath heavens face,</br>It seated is farre in a pleasant wood,</br>Where many a loftie Joviall tree hath stood,</br>Not much unlike, that wood by thornie grove</br>Full of the tree erected unto Jove,</br>Which seated is upon the Northern Strand,</br>Where Saxon Segberts sacred tower doth stand,</br>By which the Prince of Albions watrie deepes</br>From the French Ocean with swift currant sweepes,</br>Wasting each yeare by his Labrynthian strand,</br>More then a thousand keele from forren land,</br>Who oft, when Boreas at their safetie raves</br>And with proud blasts doth cuffe the silver waves,</br>Do nimble fetch Lavoltoes up and downe</br>Upon the waves in scorne of Boreas frowne:</br>And such a famous wood, as that, is this,</br>In which doth stand the pleasant bower of blisse:</br>Unto the which, when as Dan Cuckow came</br>Knowing each way, that led throughout the same,</br>With Philomel he tooke the ready way,</br>Which to the bower of blisse directly lay,</br>Where in the way they both amazed stood</br>To see the pleasance of that pleasant wood,</br>There many blissefull bowers they did behold;</br>Whose dwellers neither vext with heate nor cold</br>Did there enjoy all things, that might delight</br>The curious eie of any living wight:</br>For plentie there to lavish in her gift</br>Furnisht each place in scorne of niggard thrift;</br>There many Nymphes of more then heavenly hew</br>Had their abode; although alas but few</br>Amongst them all did come of heavenly kind</br>So hard it is to gaine the gifts of mind:</br>Yet stately portance, unto them was given</br>And in proportion like the states of heaven</br>They bare themselves:  yet want both will and power</br>From loves assault to shield faire beauties bower</br>And more to beautifie the goodly frames,</br>Which God and nature gave these goodly dames,</br>Gentrie their cradles at their birth did rock</br>And drew their linage from an auncient stock:</br>But what alas availes the vading flower</br>Of beauties bud in those, that have no power</br>To guid the least part of the weaker sence</br>And learne the lesson of pure continence?</br>Or what is birth to those, that so they winne</br>The seeming sweetnes of alluring sinne?</br>Bastard their birth and all their stock deprave</br>To gaine the thing, which appetite doth crave:</br>Beautie in such, though much, is but disgrace,</br>And high borne birth, though kingly, yet but base.</br>For faire is foule, where vertue is unknowne,</br>And birth is base, where gifts of grace are none.</br>From hence Dan Cuckow with faire Philomel,</br>(Acquainted with each passage very well)</br>Forward proceeded in this pleasant wood</br>Untill they came unto that place, where stood</br>The bower of blisse it selfe, so fairely deckt,</br>That never eye beheld so faire aspect:</br>In th' outer portch late many a slick hear'd Squier</br>Of pleasing semblance, full of loose desire,</br>Of feature fit to feast a Ladies eie;</br>But manlie exercise unfit to trie:</br>Their cunning did consist in sleights of love,</br>With which from loyaltie they oft did move</br>Ladies fraile hearts:  for unto many a one</br>They vow'd themselves; though faithful unto none,</br>Unto the secrets of the unchaste sheet</br>They sworne were, an oath for such unmeet:</br>For which their service oftentimes they fed</br>On ransackt sweetnes of the nuptiall bed:</br>But let nor such discourse defile my pen</br>With argument, of such reprochfull men;</br>Let it suffice that such, as they do bring</br>Dan Cuckow heere to welcome in our spring.</br>Mong'st these, there was a squier of greatest place</br>And cheefest held in that great Ladies grace,</br>Which dwelt in this same bower:  for many a night</br>With her he stole a snatch of loves delight:</br>For he was lustie, young, fit for her tooth,</br>And her great wealth did well content his youth.</br>Yet he was false, disloyall to his dame;</br>For in his common talke devoid of shame</br>He of his Ladies favour was too francke,</br>For which I con that lover little thanke;</br>He was the usher to this daintie dame</br>And Vanitie men gave him unto name,</br>To whom Dan Cuckow often louting low</br>By his obsequious signes his mind did show</br>And chaunted out to Philomels disgrace</br>His unchaste note, well knowne in that same place:</br>For this same Squier full well I wot did know</br>Dan Cuckowes note and unto him did go,</br>Where seeing little Casta by him stand,</br>Cause of their comming friendly did demaund:</br>Dan Cuckow proud of such an intertaine</br>Did tell the jarre begun betwixt them twaine,</br>Who should be cheefe of all the birds to sing</br>As herbenger to welcome in the spring,</br>And now to end the same, they both were come</br>Agreed to stand unto the wood-Nymphes doome;</br>Wherefore they crav'd accesse unto his dame,</br>That with her Nymphes me might decide the same:</br>This gentle Squier soone graunted their requests</br>And kindlie did conduckt his new come guests</br>Into an inward court, where they should stay,</br>Till to his dame their message he did say;</br>Where, while they staid, with great delight they spent</br>The time in viewing this faire continent,</br>This bower of blisse, this paradise of pleasure,</br>Where lavish plentie did exceed all measure;</br>The inner portch seem'd entrance to intice,</br>It fashion'd was with such quaint rare device,</br>The top with cannopie of greene was spred</br>Thicken'd with leaves of th' Ivies wanton bed,</br>About the which the Eglentine did twine</br>His prickling armes the branches to combine,</br>Bearing sweete flowers of more then fragrant odour,</br>Which stellified the roofe with painted colour;</br>On either side the vine did broad dilate</br>His swollen veines with wreathings intricate,</br>Whose bunches to the ground did seeme t' incline,</br>As freely offring of their luscious wine:</br>Through this same portch went many a worthy wight</br>Unto the bower of blisse, both day and night,</br>Who at their entrance fresh and flush as May</br>Did beare themselves adorn'd in rich aray:</br>But few return'd without the common curse</br>Ot strange disease of emptinesse in purse,</br>Who wanting golden shewers for Danaes lap,</br>As discontented with their sad mishap</br>Walkt to and fro, forlorne in deepe disdaine</br>With willow braunch, for prise of all their paine.</br>From this same portch, a walke directly lay,</br>Which to the bower it selfe did leade the way</br>With fruit-trees thicke beset on either side,</br>Whose goodly fruit themselves did seeme to hide</br>Beneath the leaves, as lurking from the eies</br>Of strangers greedie view, fearing surprise,</br>Whose arched bowes and leavie twigs together</br>With true love knots intangled each in other,</br>Seem'd painted walles, on which when Zephire blew</br>They spread themselves, disclosing unto view</br>The blossomes, buds, the birds and painted flies</br>That in their leaves lay hid from strangers eies</br>This walke of people never emptie was:</br>For to the bower of blisse one could not passe;</br>But that the way did swarme with jetting jacks,</br>Who bare upon their french diseased backes,</br>Whole manners, castles, townes and Lordships sold</br>Cut out in clippings and in shreds of gold:</br>Their chambring fortitude they did descrie</br>By their soft maiden voice and flickering eie,</br>Their womans manhood by their cloaths perfum'd,</br>Coy lookes, curl'd lockes, and thin beards halfe consum'd,</br>Whose nice, effeminate and base behaviour</br>Was counted comely, neate and cleanly gesture;</br>This pleasant walke, when gentle Philomel</br>And Cuckow her proud foe had viewed well</br>Passing forth, one loe there they did behold</br>High lifted up with loftie roofe of gold</br>The bower of blisse, in which there did abide</br>The Ladies selfe, that should their cause decide</br>On which the heavens still in a stedfast state</br>Look't alway blithe, diverting froward fate,</br>Not suffering ycie frost, or scorching sunne</br>To vex th' inhabitants, that there did wonne:</br>For there eternall spring doth ever dwell,</br>Nay they of other season ought can tell</br>They labour notwith hands of industrie</br>To furrow up the earthes fertilitie,</br>Bubbles of sweate decline not from their brow,</br>Ne stooping labour makes their backes to bow:</br>Yet plentie of all fruits upon their ground,</br>Seedlesse and artlesse every where is found:</br>Unto this bower Dan Cuckow and his mate</br>Approaching nigh, loe standing at the gate,</br>Which framed was of purest Ivorie</br>All painted ore with many a historie,</br>So sweetly wrought, that arte in them did seeme</br>To mocke at nature as of no esteeme,</br>Eftsoones they heard a pleasing harmonie</br>0f musikes most melodious minstralsie,</br>There sweet voic'd birds, soft winds and waters fall,</br>With voice and Violl made agreement all,</br>The birds unto the voice did sweetly sing,</br>The voice did speake unto the Viols string,</br>That to the wind did sound now high now low,</br>The wind to waters fall did gently flow;</br>Thus birds,voice, Violl, winds and waters all</br>Did sing, did speake, did sound, did blow, did fall:</br>As thus Dan Cuckow and his opposite,</br>The Nightingale stood harkening with delight</br>Unto this musike, loe that Squire came</br>Hight Vanitie with answere from his dame,</br>That 'gainst the morne themselves they should prepare,</br>Their cause in ample manner to declare;</br>For with her Nymphes in judgement she would sit,</br>And which of them, they should efteeme most fit,</br>She would denounce for cheefe in woods to sing,</br>As herbinger unto the joyfull spring:</br>This newes did glad them both; for both did feed</br>Themselves with hope:  although but one could speed</br>And both prepar'd each other to excell</br>In the next morne, to beare away the bell:</br>The little Philomel with curious care,</br>Sitting alone her ditties did prepare,</br>And many tunes, whose harmonie did passe</br>All musike else that ere invented was.</br>One while the meane part shee did sweetly warble</br>The tennor now, the Base and then the trebble:</br>Then all at once with many parts in one,</br>Dividing sweetly in division;</br>Now some sweete straine to mind she doth restore,</br>Which all the winter she had conn'd before,</br>And with such cunning deskants thereupon,</br>That curious art nere doctrin'd any one</br>With Lute, with Violl, or with voice in quier</br>That to her matchlesse musike might aspire:</br>Meane time Dan Cuckow, knowing that his voice</br>Had no varietie, no change, no choice:</br>But through the wesand pipe of his harsh throate</br>Cri'd only Cuckow, that prodigious note,</br>That want with wits supplie he did amend</br>And made that Squier, Vanitie his friend,</br>Who did so worke for him, as it befell</br>That judgement went against poore Philomel.</br>The time came on, and th' Opall coloured morne,</br>Bright cheekt Aurora leaving all forlorne</br>Old Tython in his bed, did up arise</br>Opening the gates of the orientall skies,</br>Through which the daies bright king came dauncing out</br>With glorious golden lockes bespread about</br>His shoulders broad; from whence such luster came,</br>That all the world did seeme a golden flame:</br>For then Auroraes trumpe, the peasants clocke,</br>Daies herbinger, the bloody crested cocke</br>With flaggie wings had beate black night away,</br>And sung sweet tidings of approaching day,</br>At which both birds up starting from their rest</br>Quaintly to plead their cause, themselves addrest,</br>Which with her Nymphes, that day in solemne state</br>The Ladie of this bower should debate,</br>Which flying fame upon her wings did beare,</br>Making it vulgar newes in every eare,</br>And with her silver trumpe did Echo out</br>Report thereof, in all the woods about;</br>Which once being blowen abroad, all the whole quier</br>Of singers in the wood with great desire,</br>(To know in this same strife, who should prevaile</br>Dan Cuckow, or the little Nightingale)</br>Came flocking, through the aire, and as they flew,</br>Their divers warbling notes about they threw;</br>There came the Larke, who still as me did flie</br>With outstretcht' wings aspir'd the cloud brow'd skie,</br>There Progne came who did present for food</br>In tragicke feast, her owne deare Itis blood</br>To bloodie Tereus, in avengment fell</br>Of sister deare Pandions Philomel,</br>Who now transform'd unto the sent-strong Swallow,</br>Shaftlike did flie through the skies concave hollow;</br>With these there came the Thrush, that loves the grape,</br>The speckled Spinck, that lives by gummie sappe,</br>The Redbreast sweet, that loves the lookes of men,</br>The lustfull Sparrow and the little Wren,</br>The chattering Pie, the quick conceited Stare,</br>The golden Finch and Linnot singing rare</br>With many more, whose notes the aire did fill</br>With true consort, sweet worke of natures skill,</br>Who to the bower of blisse did take their way</br>To heare the jarre decided, that same day,</br>Which the approach of spring did late excite</br>Betwixt Dan Cuckow and his opposite:</br>The place, in which this matter should be tride</br>Was in a greene pailde round on every side,</br>In which was pight a stately cannopie;</br>For that great Ladie and her companie,</br>Many a courtly Nymph of great estate,</br>That should that day  Dan Cuckowes cause debate</br>Who being pearcht aloft in open sight</br>Upon a leavelesse braunch, had well ydight</br>And decks his plumes to make a pleasant show</br>When he should pleade his cause against his foe</br>Who on the other side her selfe did place,</br>In hope Dan Cuckow foulely to disgrace</br>Nor doubting but those Nymphes for Phoebes sake</br>In this so just a cause, her part would take:</br>The time being come, loe like as when Joves bride,</br>Heavens Ivory fingered queene in pompe doth ride</br>To heavens high court, above the Planets seaven,</br>To sit in counsell with the gods of heaven:</br>Even so forth comes that faire renowmed dame,</br>Chiefest of all the bower of blisse, that came</br>To judge the controversie that befell,</br>Betwixt Dan Cuckow and faire Philomel,</br>Shee was a Ladie gaudie in attire</br>And to content th' affect of her desire,</br>Th' earthes golden bowels often wounded were</br>And th' Indian slave with steele did often teare</br>The hard rockes rubie ribs in hope to find</br>Treasure to pleasure her disdainfull mind:</br>Proudly she pass'd it with a princely gate,</br>As earth had been too meane for her estate,</br>Looking to heaven with her disdainfull eies;</br>For humble object she did still dispise:</br>Yet was her birth but meane, and her esteeme</br>Respectively compar'd, but base did seeme,</br>Loosely she was aray'd in wanton weed</br>Which wanderers eies did with inticement feed,</br>For she was clad in robe of tissue thinne,</br>Through which so brim appear'd her snowie skin,</br>That it did seeme to those, that did it see,</br>No whit obscur'd, but farre more white to bee;</br>Her Ivorie brests did ever open lie</br>To readie spoile of gazers greedie eie,</br>And both her lillie paps were bare to winne</br>Her lovers melting heart to wanton sinne;</br>Her name the which was Meehafasto hight</br>Her double nature did expresse aright:</br>With her there hither came a goodly crew</br>Of lovely Nymphes of seeming Angels hue,</br>Featur'd each where in bodies lineament,</br>As if they late had left the firmament,</br>Or as if heavens divine triplicitie,</br>Out of some fift unknowne simplicitie,</br>For there complexions hue had fram'd some mixture,</br>Passing the homely gift of common nature;</br>But pittie 'twas, such angell seeming creatures</br>With ulcerous minds deform'd such heavenly features:</br>For they were wanton, full of loose desire</br>And in their heart did nourish lustfull fire,</br>With glauncing lookes, like summers evening lights</br>They could allure the rash beholders fights</br>And Heliotropon-like with sun-like skill</br>Could cause soft hearts to turne unto their will</br>When they lift speake, their words like to a lake</br>Breaking through rocks of rubie, seem'd to make</br>Celestiall musike with their pleasing sound,</br>Amongst the silver pearles, that stood around,</br>With which they Syren-like could often move</br>Modest Hypolitus to wanton love,</br>They all acoutered were in sundrie fashion,</br>Seeming t' have been all of a severall nation,</br>Some in the antique Roman Lords attire</br>Did shape themselves, as seeming to aspire</br>Some captaines place, or as if they had been</br>Symiramis, that manlike monster queene,</br>In Persian loose aray, some did delight,</br>Or rather disaray, so loosely dight,</br>In the french doublet some againe did jet</br>Wanting but slops to make a man compleat,</br>Some on their heads did beare the fatall signe,</br>Which of fooles future fortune did divine,</br>Others againe Morisko caps did weare</br>Maid-marrian like with brooches in each care</br>And Indian-like did paint inch thicke in view;</br>Though natures red and white were Angels hew.</br>Thus with their fashions strange varietie,</br>They did bewray their minds inormitie:</br>For things externall sought with strong affect</br>Internall thoughts both good and bad detect,</br>Which, when the little Casta did behold</br>Poore bird her fearefull heart did wax stone cold:</br>But now too late mee did repent, that shee</br>Had made them judges of her cause to bee:</br>For thither now, they were alreadie come</br>According to their minds to give their doome,</br>Where heapes of people thronging in the way</br>Did earlie waite for them by breake of day</br>To know, what bird should beare away the bell</br>The bastard Cuckow or faire Philomel:</br>The judges being set, up straight did stand,</br>The crier of the court who did command</br>High, with shrill voice and great authoritie</br>A generall silence through the companie;</br>Which done forth stept the little Casta hight,</br>Who being pearcht aloft in open sight</br>After obeysance to those damsels made,</br>That were as judges set, thus boldly said:</br>(Fairest of faire) who from the joyous prime</br>Of your great birth, untill this very time,</br>Have trained been in this celestiall place,</br>This bower of blisse in vertue and in grace,</br>For vertues sake vouchsafe with silent pause</br>To heare poore Philomela plead her cause.</br>What once I have been, now I need not tell,</br>Nor what I am, I know, yee know it well:</br>Yee know, that once, when in great Athens towne</br>My Sire, good king Pandion wore the crowne,</br>A Ladie then I was, as now yee bee</br>And daughter to a king, till wo is mee,</br>The Thracian king, whose lust-burnt thoughts did flame</br>And burne in foule desire, did worke my shame:</br>In Thracian woods (O ever be forgot</br>The place in which mine honor he did blot)</br>In Thracian woods (I say) the tyrant fell</br>Unto his will did force poore Philomel,</br>And led his wicked acte I should descrie</br>The cruell edged steele he did applie</br>Unto my tongue, and with most bitter smart</br>Did rob me of the Echo of my heart:</br>All this and more then this, yee all do know</br>So common is poore Philomelaes woe.</br>Yee know likewise how in avengement fell</br>My furious sister, Progne did compell</br>The lustfull Tereus in a fatall feast</br>To swallow downe into his lust-burnt brest</br>His owne deare sonne, his Itis, that sweet youth,</br>Whose death breeds in my heart eternall ruth:</br>For which when as the tyrant did decree</br>With wrathfull sword to wreake revenge on me</br>Heaven pittie tooke and gave to me this shape,</br>By which his fell intent I did escape,</br>And as an exile from all mens abode</br>I since have lived in the desert wood,</br>Where sitting once on humble thorne alone</br>And in my wofull ditties making mone</br>For my old Sire, Pandion, that good King,</br>Whose timelesse death my sad mischance did bring;</br>Loe, That great Huntresse of renowmed fame</br>The Ladie Phoebe following the game</br>In the wild wood hath silent stood in pittie</br>To heare the sad tunes of my dolefull dittie,</br>And being mov'd with deepe remorse of mind</br>That fates had been so cruell and unkind</br>'Gainst me poore wretch; she did vouchsafe to show</br>Compassion towards me in my bitter woe.</br>While in these woods and forrests she did use,</br>Mongst all the quier for chiefe, she did me chuse</br>To be her bird, and while shee was my dame</br>Not Philomel, but Casta was my name,</br>And, for I was the daughter of a King,</br>Shee made me cheefe of all the quier to sing,</br>And in her woods ordained me the shade</br>To shroude my selfe from Tereus bloodie blade:</br>But loe alas, what time hath brought to pace,</br>Loe heere a tyrant, worse then Tereus was,</br>Loe heere Dan Cuckow my sterne enemie</br>Claiming my right with proud authoritie,</br>Who this same blissefull place as death did shun,</br>When as my dame in these same woods did wonne.</br>(O) how it irkes me, that a bird so base</br>Pandions princely daughter should disgrace,</br>Who by condition of his qualitie</br>Unto the world discries his bastardie:</br>Is't not inough, that once I being a dame</br>Yborne of auncient Kings of worthie fame</br>Now live a bird loathing mans companie</br>In desert woods for love to chastitie,</br>And in the echoing mountaines loudly sing</br>Phoebes chaste song, when as the lustie spring</br>Stirres up young bloods, that with my chaster layes</br>I may recall them from their wanton waies?</br>But must a bird the basest of the crue</br>In all the woods stand up to wrest my due</br>Unto his lot, which Phoebe did ordaine</br>Should unto me for ever more remaine?</br>Nor is it yet enough alas, that I</br>From stately palaces of kings do flie,</br>Still dreading Tereus lothsome luxurie</br>To live in woods farre from all companie</br>But must another Tereus seeke t' expell</br>From woods likewise the forlorne Philomel?</br>Alas it so, where shall I hide my head,</br>Where shall I shun th' inevitable dread</br>Of bloodie Tereus hot lust-sparkling face,</br>If nor in woods, nor house I shall have place?</br>To you therefore (faire Nymphes) to your just doome</br>That as the umpiers of my cause are come</br>I do appeale, not doubting but the love</br>You beare to Phoebus name your hearts will move</br>In this so just a cause to pittie mee,</br>That was as deare to her as deare might bee.</br>Which if yee do, your fame shall never die</br>And Castas selfe shall sing your praise on hie.", "This said, shee breathed from her brest so cleare</br>The sweetest layes, that eare did ever heare</br>To which all other birds about the place</br>Did tune their divers notes to do her grace</br>As in approvance of her worth to sing</br>As chiefe in woods to welcome in the spring,</br>Which did so daunt Dan Cuckowes daring pride</br>That oft he thought his shamefull head to hide:</br>But knowing well that he had friends in place</br>That of those partiall Nymphes had got him grace,</br>Feare set aside, and his obeysance made,</br>Unto those Nymphes these words he boldly said:</br>(Yee glorious offspring of great honors bed,</br>Vertues faire impes, mirrors of womanhed,</br>Bright Angel-like sweet Nymphes, whole beauties blaze</br>Adornes the world like Tytans golded rayes)</br>Vouchsafe with gentle patience for a space</br>Your gratious silence, while I pleade my case.</br>The jarre begun betwixt my foe and me,</br>The subject of my purps'd speech should be;</br>But first both words and wit, I must applie</br>To make an answere to mine enemie.</br>Though of my birth no boaster I will be</br>Seeing in this cause it nought availeth me;</br>Yet, that I may, that scandalisme refute,</br>Which my false foe doth unto me impute,</br>Know that Joves bird, the Eagle prince of ayre</br>Did foster me being young with tender care,</br>In whose proud neast ybuilt, in Joviall Tree</br>My dame by secret stelth conveied me.</br>In that same clime, where Aestas sits in pride</br>Beneath the tropick of hot sommers guide,</br>The crabbed Cancer, where in earthes coole cels,</br>The hot sun painted people ever dwels,</br>Not far from whence great Nilus evermore</br>With fruitfull waves doth warm th' Egyptian shore,</br>There was I bred, and there my fame first grew,</br>Which thence long since about the wide world flew.</br>For South from thence the land of Cyprus lies,</br>Whereas the people use to sacrifice</br>To loves faire Queene, of whom I wonne great grace,</br>When she was wroth with people of that place;</br>For once being sore offended with them all</br>And musing with her selfe, what plague should fall</br>Upon their heads, she chaunc'd to cast her eie</br>Upon an horne, which she did soone applie</br>Unto their browes, whereby they straight forsooke</br>Their former shape, and Oxe-like was their looke:</br>But they blind buzzards could not see the same,</br>Whereby the lesser was their griefe and shame,</br>Till ore their goodly heads, I wav'd my wing</br>And cuckow in their ears aloud did sing;</br>Which when they heard, like raging Buls they bore</br>Their loftie heads, and with loud bellowing rore</br>Did show their jealous thoughts:  for which men say</br>They called are Cerastes to this day:</br>And for this fact of mine the Cyprian dame,</br>The Queene of love did give to me for name</br>The song, which I did sing and did decree,</br>That I thenceforth her only bird should be;</br>She bore me to that garden of great fame,</br>Which yet of her Adonis beares the name,</br>Where she herselfe did teach me how to sing,</br>Her sweet delights unto the youthfull spring;</br>And did appoint, that the yeares youthly prime</br>Should be the season of my singing time:</br>For well she knew, that season did belong</br>Unto the nature of my pleasant song;</br>As for my foe, although her layes be sweet:</br>Yet be they sad patheticall unmeet</br>To be recorded, when the lustie spring</br>Tidings of pleasure to the world doth bring,</br>More fit with little Redbrest on a thorne</br>To beare a part, and helpe her for to mourne</br>For losse of sommer, when cold winters breath</br>To all our pleasures threatens hatefull death:</br>Then (gentle dames, great Ladies of delight)</br>Who in this bower of blisse both day and night</br>Have your abode, where winter lowres</br>Ne on your heads powres downe his stormie shewers;</br>Let it be seene that ye have need of none</br>The sommer past in winter to bemone:</br>So shall Dan Cuckow sing your lasting praise</br>Before loves Queene in his delightfull lades.</br>This said, he chaunted out his Cuckows song,</br>Which laughter bred among'st the thickest throng,</br>Nor any prettie bird about the place</br>Would in their song vouchsafe to do him grace.</br>But see the chaunce the Nymphes being in a pause</br>And in consult how to decide this cause,</br>And each one being husht with greedie eare</br>To heare that sentence, which they least did feare,</br>Or all the Nymphes up stood the chiefest dame</br>And thus this unjust sentence did proclaime:</br>(O all yee singers of the woods sweet quier)</br>Heare now the doome, which ye did long desire,</br>And (ye) twixt whom the jarre begun but late,</br>As yet hangs in suspence without debate,</br>Know that each others cause doth now abide</br>In equall ballance, which we thus decide.</br>Seeing to the nature of each others song,</br>Two parts of all the yeare seeme to belong,</br>That part in equall doome we will ordaine,</br>Which is most meet for either of you twaine;</br>First touching Philomel, seeing that her dittie</br>Is alwaies passionate and moving pittie,</br>Seeing with her, when she sings in wofull wise</br>The echoing mountaines seeme to sympathize,</br>And rockes to weepe, and trees do seeme to grone,</br>When in lameming layes she list to mone</br>In that sad time, when Boreas winged scouts</br>Locks up the fruitfull Terras water spouts,</br>And with congealing puffes do crystalize</br>The cloud-like waves of Neptunes liquid skies;</br>Let Philomel in her pathetike straine</br>For sommers losse in leavelesse woods complaine,</br>Lest, when her dolefull ditties she doth sing</br>She do disturbe the pleasance of our spring:</br>But for Dan Cuckow seeing he never sings,</br>But when sweet Zephirus on gentle wings,</br>Breathing good morrowes to the faire Aurora,</br>Begins each day to kisse his wanton Flora.</br>We thinke it meete, that he be chiefe to sing,</br>Where ere he meets the Ladie of the spring.</br>And seeing, when earth hath lost her flowring May</br>He cannot sing for greefe of her decay,</br>Here let him stay, where he may ever sing</br>Seeing heere with us we have eternall spring.</br>This is our doome and thus we do debate</br>The cause betwixt Dan Cockow and his mate.</br>Thus having said, she ceast, and thereupon</br>Such murmur, as we heare in woods, that grone,</br>When winds rouz'd up throngh hollow grounds do break,</br>Such noise was heard 'mong'st those, that heard her speake;</br>And all the quier of birds about the place</br>Did droope and hang the head, for such disgrace</br>To wronged Philomel, and for her sake,</br>A mournefull melodie did seeme to make:</br>But what alas availes their distcontent,</br>Those partiall judges rose, and with them went</br>Dan Cuckow singing his triumphant song,</br>While Philomel bewailes her helpelesse wrong,</br>Who being unjustly robbed of her right</br>And from the bower of blisse exiled quite,</br>Calling to mind, how that she once had been</br>The happie daughter of a King and Queene,</br>And since that she in shape of bird did live,</br>What honor Phoebes selfe to her did give,</br>Now from all future hope being quite cast downe,</br>Orecome with griefe, she fell in suddaine swoune,</br>And groveling in the dust on her sad brest,</br>With deadly sorrowe being sore opprest,</br>Poore bird she hung the wing and gasp'd for breath</br>Seeming to yeeld unto the panges of death;</br>To whom her sister Progne standing by</br>With speed to her recovery did flie,</br>And hovering over her, made pitious plaint</br>For to revive her, that began to faint,</br>Dead was her heart, to see her sister lie</br>In such a traunce and often wish't to die,</br>Shee strock't her temples with her pretie beake</br>And raysing up her limbes, that were so weake,</br>With gentle touch did feele each tender part,</br>And drove to strengthen her now dying heart:</br>Unto her aide the gentle Redbrest came,</br>The Wren, and fruitfull Titmouse, that sterne dame,</br>Who did applie their helpe at need so well,</br>That now the flitting life of Philomel</br>Halfe conquer'd with cold death, did make retreate</br>Unto the heart, the house of native heate;</br>Which, when her sister Progne did espie</br>These words of comfort, shee did soone applie;</br>(Ay me) quoth she, (deare sister) thou that are</br>Now made the image of unpatient smart,</br>Why dost thou not in these sad passions show</br>Thy wonted patience in afflicting woe,</br>And to our counsell lend thy listening eare,</br>The which may teach thee patiently to beare</br>This rufull sorrow, which doth stop thy breath</br>And seekes to hasten thy untimely death;</br>Speake (O deare sister) speake, and tell us why</br>Thy soule with griefe opprest should seeke to die.</br>She having said, the wofull Philomel,</br>Whose sad soule all this while in traunce did dwell,</br>Did lift up th' heavie windowes of her eies</br>And spake these rufull words in wofull wise.</br>Tempestuous chaunce her utmost spite hath spent,</br>And at me wretch her utmost dart hath sent,</br>Nor any plague is left, that me can tell,</br>With which t' oppresse the forlorne Philomel,</br>For since the time, that I, as well you know</br>Was, (woe alas that now I am not so)</br>Pandions daughter in my virgins state,</br>I have endur'd sterne fortunes utmost hate.</br>Can I forget my Thracian slaverie</br>Beneath falsie Tereus lustfull villanie,</br>Or cease to thinke upon my virgins rape,</br>With losse of tongue and Ladies lovely shape?</br>Yea can I live and leave to have in mind</br>Fortunes last wrong, not least, but most unkind</br>Those Nymphes late doome, I meane, by whose decree</br>A forlorne outcast I shall ever bee?</br>For from Dan Cuckowes song my shame doth spring</br>And where alas, will not Dan Cuckow sing?</br>Sith then, to me poore wretch by cruell fate</br>Naught else is left of former princely state</br>But shame and woe, why do I longer feed</br>On loathed light, which wo afresh will breed?</br>This said, she sunke againe in deadly swound:</br>But Progne quickly rais'd her up from ground,</br>Thrice did she sincke as dead, and thrice againe</br>Did Progne raise her up with busie paine;</br>At last, when life her setled place did take</br>To comfort her, the little Wren thus spake:</br>Now certes madame Philomel, quoth she,</br>You have great cause of plaint we all do see,</br>The which I weene would pierce the stoutest heart</br>And launch the boldest brest with bleeding smart;</br>Yet comfort to you take, and do not you</br>Let passions rage rob reason of her due;</br>Thinke with your selfe, as now too true it is,</br>That in this pleasant place, this bower of blisse,</br>Since that Dan Cuckow findeth entertaine,</br>For us no certaine safetie doth remaine:</br>For well we see the Nymphes of this same place</br>Have given over that same wonted chase</br>Of harmefull beasts, which Pheobe did delite</br>Following strange game with greedie appetite:</br>Yea 'tis reported many Satyrs rude</br>Into their company themselves intrude,</br>By whose inticementyou they did forsake</br>In their false doome Dan Cuckowes part to take</br>Then do not greeve at this their unjust doome,</br>Ne thinke your selfe disgrac'd as overcome</br>Before such dames; for grace it seemes to me</br>To be disgrac'd of those, that gracelesse be:</br>But swage your griefe in this so ruefull case,</br>And go with us unto our dwelling place,</br>Where though alone in desert place it be;</br>Yet there from feare of foes you shall be free:</br>For as dame Titmouse and Redbrest can tell</br>Dan Cuckow seldome sings, where we do dwell,</br>True, (neighbour Wren) the Redbrest did replie,</br>We live in safetie, though in penurie;</br>And if dame Philomel with us will go,</br>Such kindnesse as poore Robbins bower can show</br>She shall command, and though in that same wood,</br>None of the courtly birds have their abode;</br>Yet there do many gentle singers dwell,</br>That will be loving unto Philomel.</br>Yea; quoth the Titmouse, neither shall she there</br>Of proud Dan Cuckowes threatnings stand in feare.</br>For all birds there his bastard note abhors</br>And evermore do make him deadly wars,</br>Twice sixe stout sonnes, ae this same very houre</br>I have now living in my little bower,</br>All which shall serve the wronged Philomel</br>Against Dan Cuckow, if with us she dwell:</br>Thus did these birds with gentle speech assay</br>Sad Philomelaes greefe to drive sway;</br>But long it was, ere sorrow would depart,</br>It was so deepely setled in her heart:</br>Yet at the length the Swallow Progne hight</br>Did so perswade her, that she tooke her flight</br>With little Titmouse, Robbin and the Wren</br>To desert woods farre from th' abodes of men:</br>But Progne selfe returned backe againe</br>To Trinobant, where she doth still remaine:</br>Thus from the bower of blisse was Plilomel</br>Exil'd for aye in forraine woods to dwell</br>While there Dan Cuckow as chiefe bird did sing</br>To tell the pleasures of the youthfull spring:</br>The mansion house, in which poore Philomel,</br>Did with her new companions daily dwell,</br>Was in a rocke, whose head it selfe did shroud</br>In mistie cloake of many a wandring cloud,</br>And whole thicke mossie sides and hollow wombe</br>To many a bird did yeeld much building roome,</br>It seated was downe in a valley low,</br>Where many a silver gliding streame did flow,</br>And leavie woods in arbor wise did stand,</br>As made by art, and not by natures hand.</br>From right side of this rocke, there issued out</br>A crystall spring which flowed round about</br>The bottome of the rock, whose upper brim</br>Thick set with hearbes and flowers smelt sweet and trim:</br>In th' hollow of this rock the humming swarmes</br>Of honie flies, whose bodies nature armes</br>With biting stings did beare a murmuring base</br>Unto the spring, that trickling downe apace</br>From of the rock did meanely seeme to warbble</br>Among'st the pibble stones unto the trebble,</br>Which many prettie birds did seeme to sing,</br>Hovering about the rocke with painted wing:</br>This was the place of Philomels abode</br>With her companions in the defert wood,</br>Where all the time of those long fasting houres,</br>When as the heavenly crab with his eight oares</br>Doth in the starrie Zodiack softly row,</br>Felicitie did in abundance softly flow,</br>Whereby faire Philomel did find no misse</br>Of wonted pleasure in the bower of blisse:</br>For there where curious art her helpe denide,</br>There natures selfe, that want with store supplide:</br>If Boreas did at any time offend her</br>The hollow rock a remedie did lend her:</br>If Phoebus hurt her with his fierie rayes,</br>She found redresse beneath the leavie spraies,</br>To whose coole shades she safely might retreate,</br>When earth did crack beneath hevens burning heate:</br>If she did hunger after wonted baite,</br>The goodly fruit of every tree did waite</br>Upon her will:  yea much varietie</br>Of painted flies for her satietie</br>At hand in this her dwelling place she found,</br>So fruitfull was this pleasant plot of ground:</br>If she did thirst, or heate did her annoy,</br>What pleasure did she take, what gladsome joy</br>Unto the silver gliding stream to flie,</br>That rowled through the bordering wood fast by:</br>For when she stooping steep'd her tender beake</br>Into the wave, it oft would seeme to breake,</br>And feeling her soft bosome pant and beate</br>Would bid her bath and quench her boiling heate:</br>Mean time flowers seem'd to laugh and buds to spring,</br>Trees seem'd to bloome and blossomes forth to bring,</br>And winds to coole the scorching of the sun,</br>While by the brinke the currant smooth did run,</br>Which oft did please this prettie bird so well,</br>That in that place she still desir'd to dwell.</br>But long alas, this pleasure did not last;</br>For long it was not, ere the earth defac'd</br>By winters sad approch was forc'd to leave</br>That pompe, which from the spring she did receave;</br>For what thing is't subelementarie,</br>That still continues and doth never varie?</br>What thing retaines one forme that ever lives</br>And place unto another never gives?</br>Alas, nought permanent with us doth stay:</br>For end and offspring have succesive sway:</br>Eternall time, that auncient enemie</br>To vading natures prodigalitie</br>Remorselesse of all things with Sithe cuts downe</br>The growing glorie of this earthes renowne;</br>And as he flies with swift wings to and fro</br>By his decree, all things do come and go.</br>And so at length, where Philomel did dwell</br>Sad winter came, and sommer bad farewell.</br>With cold th' ayres lower region gan to shiver</br>And daily to the earth did downe deliver</br>The fleece-like yvorie flakes of heavenly snow,</br>Which from the neighbour region fast did flow;</br>For then from heavens point perpendicular</br>Hyperion in his spheare orbicular</br>Running his wonted race with oblique course,</br>His repercusse beames beat with lesser force</br>Upon his butt, the ball of earth, whereby</br>A weake reflection, to our aire did flie:</br>Then did the fruitfull earth begin to faint,</br>When that warme wonted comfort it did want,</br>Which from the gentle breathing aire should come,</br>To cherish up the fruit of her bigge wombe,</br>Whose sorrowes wrathfull winter to augment</br>Did muster up his forces with intent</br>To spoile her daughter sweet Pomonaes loves</br>With her Autumnus in the shadie groves,</br>Whom to withstand bold Auster, that brave Knight</br>Joyn'd forces with Autumnus for the fight,</br>And oftentimes brav'd Boreas in the field</br>Pomonaes fruits from his proud blasts to shield:</br>But raging Hyems to inforce the warre</br>All his bold Legions did revoke from farre,</br>Which in three batatiles he did thus divide</br>To quell stout Auster, and Autumnus pride,</br>The hidious stormes, that beate downe brazen wals</br>And horrid tempests that make tennis bals</br>Of mightie mountaines in the vauntgard went</br>To give the onset with bold hardiment,</br>Whose stubborne rankes with haileshot did abound</br>And drifts of snow their foe-men to confound,</br>Whom lustie Boreas full of daunting dread</br>Did unto boisterous battaile boldly lead:</br>The middle ward, great Hyems selfe did guide,</br>Who to the field like great god Mars did ride:</br>For on a winged cloud he sate on high</br>Deckt in strange armour dreadfull to the eie,</br>Upon his breast a curace he did beare</br>Of ycie mettall made, which far more cleare</br>Then crystall shone:  for like the crystall skie</br>It could subdue the gazers greedie eie,</br>Thereby his blade did hang in snow-white sheath,</br>With which he us'd t' imploy works of cold death</br>Mong'st those, that needie were, and could not arme</br>Themselves to shun the stroke of his strong arme,</br>His ycie Helmet powdered with white snow</br>Great terror and bright glory both did show,</br>And in the steade of plume stood thereupon</br>A bunch of ysacles by nature growen;</br>Which with pure snow being sprinckled diverslie</br>Did seeme to daunce and leape for jollitie:</br>His shield, which at his back parts he did settle,</br>Was neatly fram'd of Diamondlike mettell,</br>Hewen out of ycie rocks in Scythian land</br>By nature wrought, and not by Artists hand,</br>On which for badge did stand in ramping pride</br>Cold Capricorne the shivering winters guide.</br>In such like armes was wrathfull Hyems clad,</br>Whose lookes a terror to his armes did adde:</br>His browes contract above his gloomie eies,</br>On which the hoarie heares did bristled rise,</br>And Jove-like looke with grim stiffe buggle beard</br>Made his owne powers, that marcht by him, affeard.</br>To guard his person round about him stood</br>Whole hoastes of mists and many a roaring floud:</br>And thus to field the second battell went</br>Under conduct of Hyems regiment.</br>The third Battalion to the field did goe</br>Beneath great Eurus standard 'gainst the foe,</br>Who being Lord of th' Easterne parts, that lie,</br>Where great Apollo first doth mount the skie:</br>Many bold bands of souldiers brought from farre,</br>To serve the mightie Hyems in this warre;</br>In service with him for light horsemen came,</br>Those light swift winged winds, that beare the name</br>Of Boreas and of Eurus both; for whom</br>To serve in these same warres they all were come,</br>With these th' humorous vapors joyn'd their powers</br>The gloomie fogs, and duskie drizeling showers,</br>Whole troopes of drowzie mistes, of dewe and frost,</br>Who of themselves could make a mightie hoast.</br>And thus did Hyems his whole powers divide,</br>Which winged were with clouds on either side</br>Of whose approch when Autumne first did heare,</br>His heart stroke dead, began to faint for feare:</br>Yet calling mightie Auster to his aide</br>And gentle Zephirus, his part he made,</br>As able as he could, and boldly went</br>To frustrate winter of his proud intent;</br>Unto his aide the King of forrests all</br>Came backt with his consorts, whom some do call</br>The tree of Jove, with whom there came from farre</br>Fields, forrests, woods, and groves unto this warre.</br>Thus did both parts prepare with all their might</br>To meete each other in th' appointed fight.</br>The time being come, before the fight began</br>Downe from the hilles the torrents swiftly ran,</br>As scouts from Hyems campe to take survey</br>Of Autumnes host, that in the valleys lay,</br>Which all the birds about both neere and farre</br>Tooke as a warning of th' approching warre,</br>And for themselves provided all in hast</br>Untill the danger of the warre were past:</br>Mong'st whom the little Redbrest with great care</br>Of Philomel her friend did make repaire</br>Unto the rock, where she and Philomel</br>This dangerous time might both in safetie dwell:</br>Then came proud Hyems forward to the fight</br>Downe from the ayrie mountaines that ere pight</br>In th' articke side, whereas the Dragons traine</br>Divides the wrathfull beares by Charles his waine:</br>The battels joyn'd, and both the hosts did meet,</br>Where lustie Auster cuffe for cuffe did greet</br>The mightie Boreas selfe, whose verie breath</br>Did powder-like blast other foes to death:</br>Then came the stormes and tempests to the fight</br>In blacke, fresh, gloomie horror all bedight,</br>With smouldering fume, thick driftes of drizeling raine,</br>Commixt with haileshot, full of deadly bane,</br>Who at the first their foes did soone confound,</br>Rending up woods and forrests from the ground,</br>Whose leavie heads disperst about did flie,</br>Tost to and fro, like feathers in the skie:</br>Then to the reskew with the westerne King</br>Milde Zephirus, came Autumne, who did bring</br>Many swift winged winds, who with great might</br>At first incounter did renue the fight:</br>For many justing clouds, that came in course</br>With bold intent to beare their violent force</br>Being hem'd in round about, could not abide,</br>But deadly wounded were on every side,</br>Who fearing in their cloudie shapes to die</br>In humerous thin drops away did flie:</br>But now to gaine the glorie of the day,</br>Loe, Eurus came, who at his first assay</br>By violent force did end the doubtfull fight</br>And turn'd his foes into inglorious flight.", "Meane time, great Autumne tooke his love aside,</br>His faire Pomonas selfe, whom he did hide</br>In wooden walles of forrests, woods and groves,</br>From mightie Hyems false inveigling loves,</br>While he with Zephirus and Auster flew</br>To Tytans Westerne house, there to renew</br>Their powers 'gainst Aries should the yeare recall</br>To free Pomona from great Hyems thrall:</br>Meantime great winter in triumphant wise</br>Over his captive foes did tyrannize,</br>The silver brookes that sweetly wound about</br>The pleasant bankes with wreathings in and out,</br>With Adamantine-like strong ycie bands,</br>He fast did bind within the hollow lands:</br>The Crystall springs, that from the mountaines side</br>With pleasing sound to ground did gently glide</br>And brackish streames, that gushed from the rock</br>With strong congealed frost he up did lock:</br>The flowring fields, woods, hilles and mountaines greene</br>And valleyes, that before to laugh were seene,</br>In stead of fresh greene colour, now were clad</br>In hoarie hue, that made them looke full sad;</br>Yea every thing, for want of heate halfe dead</br>In winters thraldome, droop't and hung the head:</br>Yet all this time of winters wrathfull reigne,</br>When all things did in deepe distresse complaine,</br>Dan Cuckow in the bower of blisse did sing</br>His joylull note, where dwels eternall spring:</br>Where, while that he did live both day and night</br>Drencht in the daintie dregs of deepe delight,</br>With little Redbrest forlorne Philomel</br>In hollow rock inconsolate did dwell,</br>Where she poore bird in many a dolefull straine</br>The Nymphes late unjust doome did much complaine,</br>Which was the cause of all her miserie,</br>That liv'd before in chiefe felicitie.</br>The state, which fortune erst to her did give</br>Compar'd to this, in which she now did live,</br>Did trebble sorrow on her dying heart</br>A fresh reviving her forgotten smart,</br>For miserie to those most bitter is</br>That tasted once the sweets of happie blisse,</br>Which little Redbrest did perceive right well</br>In her companion gentle Philomel:</br>For once when Philomel and she together</br>In hollow rocke sate shrowded from the weather</br>Still as the Redbrest in sweet notes did sing</br>A sad complaint for absence of the spring,</br>So did poore Philomel her griefe to show</br>In sad record recount her former woe:</br>To whom the Redbrest mov'd with melting pitie</br>To heare the sad tunes of her dolefull dittie,</br>These words of comfort spake:  (sister) quoth she,</br>I see that winters blasts displeasant be,</br>And in your thoughts renewes the memorie</br>Of your precedent lives felicitie,</br>Whereby I know, your sorrow is the more,</br>That haplesse now liv'd happie heretofore:</br>But now unto my words your listening lend,</br>By which perhaps your sorrowes may have end:</br>Each yeare, when winter cause of all our woe,</br>Upon these woods with cold keene breath doth blow,</br>From hence compeld I usually do flie,</br>To famous Trynobantum, here fast by,</br>Whereas your sister Progne builds her bowers,</br>Safe from the threates of winters stormie showers,</br>For heaven that heere lookes grim with gloomie face</br>With milde aspect beholds that happie place,</br>There, not as heere th' inhabitants do know</br>Colld winters rage, nor doth proud Boreas blow</br>So sharpe and keene:  but in the welkin faire</br>The milder windes do tosse the gentle aire;</br>There also many gentle Nymphes do dwell,</br>That may compare with those that do excell</br>In beautie bright; for eye did never see</br>More faire then in great Trynobantum be,</br>To whom I do nor doubt, if that we go,</br>But they to Philomel will favour show,</br>And though those Nymphes, that in the bower of blisse</br>Have their abode, 'gainst thee have done amisse:</br>Yet they no doubt will pitie thy complaint</br>And drive Dan Cuckow from great Trynobant;</br>And in our way, as we together flie</br>Lest we be destitute of company,</br>In this our jorney with us well I know</br>Our neighbours Titmouse and dame Wren wil go:</br>Then be not sad, helpe never comes too late,</br>And time perhaps may turne your froward fate.</br>This said, sad Philomel no answere made</br>But making doubt of that, which Redbrest said,</br>Sometimes she thought it best to live content</br>In th' hollow rock all danger to prevent:</br>But when proud Boreas blasts her heart did daunt,</br>She thought it best to flie to Trynobant.</br>Thus divers doubts did in her thoughts arise,</br>Nor what was best to do could she devise,</br>Untill her neighbours Wren and Titmouse came</br>Who with perswasive speech her mind did frame</br>To Trynobant with them along to go,</br>Unto the faire Nymphes there, her cause to show</br>To trie if they for Castas sake would chase</br>The unchaste Cuckow from their dwelling place:</br>Thus by perswasion of those prettie birds,</br>The gentle Philomela soone accords</br>To go with them, though, as it came to passe,</br>The sequell prov'd their labour fruitlesse was.</br>For in their journey loe, as they did flee,</br>Taking their covert flight from tree to tree,</br>Not daring to be seene in open skie,</br>About great Trynobant they did espie</br>The swift-wing'd swallow making her strong flight,</br>Sister to Plilomela, Progne hight;</br>To whom right glad they tooke their ready way</br>Each one recording her delightsome lay,</br>Which did so loudly echo in the ayre,</br>That Progne heard it, as they came from farre,</br>And drawing nie to know what it might be</br>Staying her swift strong flight loe, she did see</br>Her sister Philomel with other birds,</br>To whom with wonderment she spake these words;</br>(O heavens) what chaunce is this, what see I heere</br>Pandions Philomel, my sister deare?</br>Alas, what sad mishap is now befell,</br>That you have left the place where you did dwell,</br>Great perill, which I wot you little know,</br>In coming hither, you do undergoe.</br>Sister (said Philomel) no great mischaunce</br>Hath happen'd unto me, nor ignorance</br>Of peril in the way hath made me bold:</br>But forced by stormie winters bitter cold.</br>My friends and I have lately left our home</br>And for reliefe to Trynobant are come,</br>Where you do live in chiefe felicitie,</br>Free from the thrall of winters tyrannie.</br>Alas (good sister) Progne did replie,</br>Let not that vaine opinion in your eie</br>Go currant, which the idiot multitude</br>Out of blind ignorance doth still conclude,</br>That meane estate is greatest miserie</br>And high esteeme the chiefe felicitie:</br>For high or low, rich are not rich indeed,</br>And great states still on discontent do feed.</br>What dreadfull danger dogs him at the heele,</br>That proudly vaunts on top of Fortunes wheele</br>What daunting dread his stealing steps attend,</br>Whose climing thoughts do ayme at honors end?</br>Who feares to fall, but he that sits on high,</br>Or feeles th' infection of an envious eie</br>For envy evermore her poison spits</br>At those, that most in fortunes favour sits,</br>The heavie care, that wounds the mind with woe</br>Seldome forsakes the giddie feet that goe,</br>Where treades the steps of high authoritie,</br>So fleeting is this earthes felicitie:</br>For wavering chaunce about him still doth fie,</br>That proudly seekes to build his hopes on high,</br>Of which a president, I well may bee</br>Unto you all, such is my chaunce you see:</br>For fate and nature having both decreed,</br>That I in loftie tops of towers should breed,</br>While you my happie sister Philomel</br>Should in the woods and forrests safely dwell,</br>About the bower of bliss once did not I,</br>A long time safely build my bowers on high,</br>Till by my foes, they all were overthrowne</br>And young ones slaine, which I shall ever mone:</br>For those false Nymphes which sentence gave 'gainst thee</br>On proud Dan Cuckowes side, did all agree,</br>Because beneath the windowes of their towers</br>My custome was to build my secret bowers,</br>That I for ever should be chased thence</br>To seeke my fortunes though for no offence:</br>For loe no crime 'gainst me they could object,</br>But that because, they said I did detect</br>Their chamber sports, and truth to say mine eye</br>Such obscene sports did oft times there espie,</br>That very shame bids me forbeare to tell</br>The nuptiall band breake play, that there befell:</br>Wherfore from thence long since they did me chase,</br>Since when I lived have in this same place,</br>Whereas you say, I build my lowly bowers</br>Safe from the threates of winters stormie showers:</br>Yet in such feare of these, that use to feed</br>On beauties spoile, about those bowers I breed:</br>That would my fate had been to live alone</br>In forrests wide, though winter made me mone.</br>She having said, this answere Redbrest made:</br>Certes (dame Progne) you have wisely said,</br>For better 'tis to live we all agree</br>In meane estate content, from danger free,</br>Then in the blind worlds deem'd felicitie</br>In trouble, care and minds perplexitie;</br>But we to Trynobant not only come,</br>For that we grieve at winters blasts at home:</br>But seeing many a bright cheek'd gentle dame</br>Dwels heere in Trynobant we hither came,</br>That so thy sister Philomel might trie,</br>If they for love to honor'd chastitie</br>Would drive Dan Cuckow from this place with shame</br>And raise againe sad Castaes dying name.</br>To this thus Progne did returne replie.</br>Alas (good Redbrest) thy fraile shallow eie</br>Nought but th' externall species doth behold,</br>Deeming all things that glister perfect gold:</br>Each winter, when thou hither dost repaire</br>Our Nymphes being spreetly vigorous and faire,</br>Thou deem'st their minds to be as wise and wittie,</br>As in proportion, they be faire and prettie:</br>But thou art blind; for do but marke with me</br>Their witlesse actions, and thou soone shalt see</br>Their faire but foule; their wit, but wanton will,</br>Their wisedomes quintessence loves idle skill,</br>For heere in Trynobant with their consent</br>Dan Cuckow sings his layes with merriment,</br>Venus no more on Ida hilles is seene,</br>In Paphos temples, nor Cytheron greene:</br>But long ago hath bid them all farewell</br>Heere in great Trynobant with us to dwell:</br>For heere the lustie Queene of love adornes</br>The poore Cerastes with the welked hornes,</br>Here the Propoetides devoid of sense,</br>Those women pictures of true impudence,</br>By the great power of loves luxurious Queene</br>Are turn'd to stones, women no more are seene.</br>For which Pigmalion leads a single life</br>And feares strange things, not daring wed a wife.</br>She having spoken, all the other birds</br>Long silent stood amaz'd at those her words</br>Till Titmouse spake, quoth she, what you do tell</br>Is verie strange and we perceive right well,</br>That gentle Casta here shall find small grace,</br>Seeing such strange Nymphes do dwell in this same place:</br>But what doth cause them with such impudence</br>In spite of modesties pure excellence</br>So much degenerate from heavenly kind?</br>Sure pinching want doth much oppresse the minde:</br>0r else with Danae for love of gold</br>They kindly suffer friends to be too bold.</br>No certes (Titmouse) Progne did replie,</br>Nor love of gold, nor pinching penurie:</br>But plentie, pleasure, ease and idlenesse,</br>Is cause of their deare deem'd voluptuousnes,</br>Whereby they oft times rather give then take</br>The golden gifts, that minds immodest make,</br>Heere need not Jove come take a sleepelesse nap</br>With golden showers in Danaes lovely lap.</br>For heere our lustie Danaes, if he want</br>Will shower downe gold on him, if he but graunt:</br>In nights black vaile, he need not hide his head</br>If he intend to go t' Amphytrions bed,</br>For th' Alcumenaes here both day and night</br>Will meet him any where for loves delight,</br>If Daphne heere do runne, she slackes her pace</br>Till Phoebus catch her, whom she must embrace,</br>And heere if lovely Syrinx do intend</br>Who runne from rugged Pan:  yet in the end</br>She seeming faint her swifter course will stay,</br>That she may be the pipe, when Pan doth play:</br>For neither Pans high hornes nor rugged beard</br>Can make the Nymphes in this same place affeard.</br>Fie, fie (dame Progne) quoth the little Wren,</br>In sooth 'gainst them, thou hast too bitter been,</br>I do not thinke that such incontinence</br>Can lurke beneath the glorious excellence</br>Of such rare beautie, which doth seeme t' excell</br>In these faire dames, that in this place do dwell;</br>Yet if in them such light demeanor be,</br>Doubtlesse they do not make it knowne to thee,</br>How then canst thou such things, as these relate</br>With their close deeds not being intimate?</br>Progne replied; unwisely have you said</br>Me with untruth ungentlie to upbraid;</br>For know dame Wren, that what I late did show</br>Is nothing in respect of that I know:</br>For in my neast built wondrous by my wit</br>Beneath their chamber-windowes I do sit,</br>Where if your selfe were present but one day,</br>You would speake more then lately I did say.</br>For there oft times I do both see and heare</br>Those things that shame to tell bids me forebeare.</br>This said, the other birds all silent sate</br>As modestly forbearing, t' aske of that</br>Which Prognes selfe did seeme halfe sham'd to tell</br>Untill at last spake gentle Philomel</br>And said (deare sister) hide not what you know;</br>Because the thing breeds shame which thou shalt show</br>For to the author of the sin be shame,</br>Not unto him, that's guiltlesse in the same,</br>Nor should examples of immodestie</br>Offend the modest eares of chasitie,</br>For vertues glorious shine, then shines most bright,</br>When 'tis oppos'd to vice her opposite,</br>As whitest things seeme fairest to the eye,</br>When they be match'd with blacke their contrarie.</br>Wherefore (deare sister) speake and boldly tell</br>The shameless deeds of dames that heere do dwell,</br>So shall we sing about the world so wide,</br>That which their chamber wals now seeme to hide,</br>Of which perhaps when they hereafter heare</br>To do the like henceforth they will forbeare.</br>She having said, thus Progne made replie</br>If that ye will (ye birds) that I descrie</br>And draw the curtaines of the unchaste bed,</br>Where Mars and Venus hornes old Vulcans head,</br>Come neare and listen, lest the obscene sound</br>Of my strange speech do in the ayre abound,</br>And in the same do breed corruption,</br>From whence may spring a foule infection</br>Of those hot furious, fierie, lustfull beasts,</br>That toil'd with lust, do loath loves vulgar feasts,</br>Whom nature cannot furnish with excesse</br>In kind-like game:  but that some monstrous messe</br>They do affect, I will not heere speake much</br>Lest I offend; my meaning is of such</br>As imitate Romes Semiramida,</br>Or that Italian Cortigiana,</br>And put in practise th' art of Aretine,</br>At which both heaven and nature doth repine,</br>And with that Lybian lustfull foule Syrenea,</br>That woman monster Dodecamechana</br>In Venus act devise twelve sundrie measures</br>With lustie lads at full to take their pleasures;</br>Nor will I tell, though many be of these</br>That with Athlanta and Hyppomenes</br>Do Stalion-like run madding out of season</br>To quench their lust, 'gainst nature and 'gainst reason;</br>Nor here to shew to you is my intent</br>That execrable squirtlike instrument,</br>Which lust burnt, fierie, female monsters use:</br>In fruitless lust, to natures vile abuse:</br>For these are things not fitting speech of birds:</br>But best befitting roughest Satyrs words.</br>I only here intend to make report</br>Of that same common counted cuckow sport,</br>Which by our dames is deem'd a lawfull game,</br>Though impudence it selfe blush at the fame,</br>(I meane of th' old Malbeccoes of our age)</br>Who justly beare Cornuted Vulcans badge.</br>In Trynobant as to and fro I flie</br>It hath been oftentimes my chaunce t' espie</br>An old cold Januarie jet before</br>A fresh young May, a spreetly Helinore,</br>Unequall both in yeares and in affection,</br>And also far unlike in their condition;</br>Yet to the blind-ey'd world it did appeare,</br>That May did love her Januarie deare;</br>Which I scarse trusting with a curious eie</br>Have closely trackt their steps the truth to trie:</br>And loe, while he hath set his thoughts upon</br>His horded heapes, his May being left alone,</br>He being close at his accounts above,</br>While she beneath sits longing after love,</br>In steps me March clad like a lustie Knight,</br>Or pleasant Aprill full of sweet delight,</br>Who in loves wanton art, nor wanting skill</br>Hath slights enow t' assault fresh May at will;</br>But what needs long assault where none doth shield</br>For gentle heart she is as prone to yeeld,</br>As he t' assault, which well this younker knowes,</br>Though seeming strange awhile with her he glose,</br>For by her touching, stroking, gentle pressing,</br>Her rubbing, wringing, wrestling, wanton thrusting,</br>Coy looking, culling and kind intertaine</br>He finds enough and knowes her meaning plaine:</br>For gentle May no proffer'd time will lose,</br>When as from home old Januarie goes,</br>And then the unchaste kisses common flies,</br>Which Hymens strongest nuptiall bands unties,</br>Then beautie sets the eies of lust on fire,</br>And fancie breakes forth into strong desire,</br>And lastly lust doth in a moment space</br>Make Januaries browes bud forth apace,</br>Which neither he, nor any else do see,</br>Though it be commonly well knowne to me:</br>For these be objects common to my sight,</br>As in my bowers I sit, both day and night.</br>Then say ye birds, if in this place can dwell</br>My sister Casta gentle Philomel.</br>Ay me, quoth Philomel, the more my griefe,</br>That I poore wretch can no where find reliefe:</br>For where alas, shall Casta find a place,</br>Where proud Dan Cuckow sings not her disgrace?</br>Great Phoebes name is now extincted quite,</br>Whose fame whilom the golden starres did smite,</br>Where else are her faire Nymphes, whose beauties blaze</br>Did decke the world with like to Phoebus raies,</br>Who with the flower of heavenly chastitie</br>Their beauties garland did so dignifie,</br>That Venus brat, though deem'd a god of power,</br>With all his flames could never scorch their flower?</br>But now alas, faire Phoebes daintie rose,</br>Which many Nymphes did in their brests inclose,</br>And with great care did tender it more deare,</br>Then dearest life, doth no where now appeare,</br>Else why doth Casta suffer such disgrace,</br>While that the Cuckow sings in every place.</br>As thus she spake, not far they did espy,</br>How proud Dan Cuckow to and fro did flie,</br>Who vaunting in the ayre with outstretch'd wing</br>His bastard note triumphantly did sing;</br>At whom the Swallow, Robbin, and the Wren,</br>And Titmouse, as if they imag'd had been,</br>With eager thoughts did flie, whom they in chase</br>A long time did pursue from place to place,</br>Oft did they flap him with their feathered quils,</br>And peckt and beat him with their tender bils,</br>Untill from out of sight he quite was fled</br>And in some covert place had hid his head:</br>But they returning backe, where making mone,</br>They late had left poore Philomel alone,</br>Loe, they beheld, how the poore bird did sit</br>Halfe dead with torment of her wofull fit.</br>To whom poore birds being mov'd with melting pitie</br>Each one did strive to tune her dolefull dittie,</br>Long sate they sympathizing in their song</br>The wofull record of poore Castaes wrong,</br>Nor of sweet comfort could they ought partake,</br>Untill at length the little Wren thus spake:</br>(My loving friends and fellow birds) quoth she,</br>Great grief doth vex your troubled thoughts I see:</br>But fond it is in sorrow still to dwell</br>And seeke no meanes sad sorrow to expell:</br>For grief, that breeds despaire, nere finds reliefe,</br>When good advice doth master greatest greife;</br>Then know, that though no Nymph of this same place</br>Nor of the bower of blisse will take to grace,</br>The forlorne Casta, Phoebes only bird,</br>Yet meaner places may perchaunce afford</br>Some gentle dame, although of meane degree,</br>That unto Philomel would gratious be;</br>And well I do remember, in that place</br>There wonnes a vertuous Nymph of goodly grace,</br>Where I do safely build my lowly bowers</br>To shrowd my selfe from winters stormie showers:</br>In humble cottage she doth still remaine,</br>The happie daughter of a countrie swaine,</br>And though she live upon meane maintenance,</br>Yet with such grace and goodly governance,</br>She doth demeane her selfe, that many be</br>Of greater state, that want her genterie,</br>For little would ye weene, that such a great grace</br>Had any lodging in so meane a place</br>She hath to wit hight Virginia to name,</br>Who though but meane, yet of exceeding fame:</br>For loe, that Squier, that lives in deepe despaire</br>Of gaining grace of Columbel the faire,</br>Unto an endlesse taske by her being ti'd</br>To wander each where, though the world so wide,</br>To prove how many damsels he could find,</br>That chastely did retaine a constant mind,</br>Did of three hundred dames find but this one,</br>That unto loves delight would not be wonne:</br>Then (gentle Philomel) lay by thy griefe,</br>And of this dame let us go seeke reliefe,</br>Upon whose bosome thou maiest sit and sing</br>The virgin beautie of her youthful spring,</br>Where proud Dan Cuckow dares not come in place,</br>Much lesse dares sing his layes in thy disgrace.</br>The Wren thus having spoke, the other birds</br>With Castaes selfe did like well of her words,</br>And with the Wren would straight unto that wood,</br>Where that same virgin dame had her abode:</br>But gentle Progne she must stay behind,</br>As being forbidden by the fates unkind;</br>Since her in shape of bird they first did hide,</br>Nere to frequent the woods and forrests wide;</br>Parting therefore from her with weeping eies</br>Her sister Philomell spake in this wise.</br>Sister (quoth she) the stubborne fates decree,</br>That from each other we must parted bee:</br>For thou alas maiest nor frequent the wood,</br>Nor may I come, where thou hast thy abode:</br>For now (aye me) hard hap doth me compell</br>Unto the bower of blisse, to bid farewell,</br>And unto Trynobant, where woe is mee</br>My dearest sister thou shalt live and see</br>My hatefull foe, Dan Cuckow proudly sing</br>In my dispight to welcome in the spring:</br>But must we then alas, for ever part,</br>The thought of which augments our wofull smart,</br>Must thus Pandions daughters bid farewell,</br>For ever in the world apart to dwell?</br>We must alas:  wherefore compel'd by fate,</br>Whose malice heaven it selfe may not abate,</br>Unto the world and thee I bid farewell</br>In desert woods for evermore to dwell.</br>Thus having said, both did with wofull heart</br>Each from the other heavily depart,</br>Sad Progne back to Trynobant did flie,</br>And gentle Philomel in companie</br>Of little Redbrest, Titmouse and the Wren,</br>Did take her way far from the abodes of men</br>Unto that place, where dwelt that gentle dame,</br>Of whom the Wren did speake:  where when she came,</br>Of that faire Nymph she found such intertaine,</br>That never more she thence return'd againe.</br>"]
