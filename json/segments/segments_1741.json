["How sweet to draw the fragrant breath of morn,</br>When glorious from the east the rising sun</br>Dispels th' unwholsome mists</br>That cloud th' awakening day.", "When soft refreshing blows the western gale,</br>And gently moves th' odoriferous shrub</br>Impregn'd with silvery dew,</br>Bright, sparkling to the sun.", "While the green verdure, or the leafy wood</br>Gladdens the eye, and adds new strength to sight;</br>The vocal feather'd tribe</br>Melodious charms the ear.", "Or from the tangled brake, or whiten'd thorn,</br>The mellow blackbird joins the softer finch,</br>While numbers thro' the grove</br>Make vocal every spray.", "The scarce fledg'd brood now try their infant wings,</br>First flutt'ring, fearful climb the lower boughs,</br>'Till grown more bold, they soar</br>From forth the native tree.", "Scarce hath the sun the hilly summit gain'd,</br>And ting'd the mountain tops with burnish'd gold,</br>When conscious of his ray,</br>The flocks beat from the fold.", "Forth from the deeper vale the mightier herds</br>Lowing, more loudly hail the glad return,</br>And crowding numbers haste</br>To fill the milky pail.", "The rosy milk-maid, glowing fresh with health,</br>Now joyfully resumes her morning care,</br>And singing, gently strokes</br>The full distended dug.", "Forth from the stable now, the harness'd horse,</br>Or from his stall the steer, the plowman drives,</br>To turn the sidelong glebe</br>O'er many a fallow land.", "Now beams with stronger heat the lamp of day,</br>Drinking with double force the shrinking dew,</br>And more delightful morn</br>Gives way to sultry noon.</br>"]
