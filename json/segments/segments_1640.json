["Oft, in romantic fantasy of thought,</br>When holding strange communion with my Heart,</br>I think it is a Harp, which Nature wrought,</br>Whence all variety of sounds might part;</br>Where every passing hand might try its art:</br>And, though the notes of Joy would suit it best,</br>And Sorrow's touch its sweetest music thwart,</br>Yet if ungentle hands its strings addrest,</br>And bade it thrill with woe, 'twould answer the behest.", "This Heart, this Harp of mine, this public Toy,</br>Hath now endur'd its three-and-twentieth year,</br>And, save when Hope hath tried the note of Joy,</br>(And even her strings were warp'd with Memory's tear,)</br>All have been sounds of harsh affliction here;</br>The coarse dull fingers of a vulgar crowd</br>Have struck it still with insolence severe;</br>And its indignant answers, deep, not loud,</br>Acutely sad have been; but not more sad than proud.", "One string there was upon this injured Harp,</br>Whence Music of sublimest influence woke;</br>'Twould sooth my cares when most my cares were sharp,</br>For with a noble melody it spoke;</br>'Twas Friendship's string; but that is long since broke:</br>The hand of Falsehood snapt the chord in twain,</br>And my whole soul so harrowed with the stroke,</br>That now, when other hands would try again</br>To bind that broken string, it spurns them with disdain!", "O mournful Harp!  and shalt thou never more</br>Breathe tones at which my wither'd soul may smile?</br>Alas!  the season of delusion's o'er!</br>That soul hath shrunk beneath the blight of guile;</br>The pestilential contact of the vile:</br>Yet, Oh!  one more last lofty strain endeavour;</br>Let Pride sustain thine energy awhile:</br>Let Pride all softer bonds at once dissever;</br>Then burst thy strings, O Harp!  and silent be for ever!</br>"]
