["As PALINODE sat in the summer shade,</br>With nymphs and shepherds on the grass around,</br>He told the tender tale by COLIN made,</br>Of love-lorn knights on sad adventures bound.</br>Nearer they press, enamour'd of the sound;</br>While some for joy, and some for pity weep;</br>Gazing in silence solemn and profound,</br>Such as to midnight moons the woodlands keep,</br>While all the echoing groves and winds and waters sleep.", "Then of POMPOSO he unroll'd the page,</br>Commencing an oration erudite,</br>Wherein conglomerating glooms engage</br>With corruscations colorific bright.</br>Enrag'd the rustic rout, with foul despite,</br>From PALINODE the sapient volume tore,</br>And to DAN SATHANAS condemn'd it quite,</br>With clamours fierce, as when on SCYLLA'S shore</br>Rough torrents thro' harsh rocks regurgitating roar.</br>"]
