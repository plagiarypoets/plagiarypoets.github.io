["O'er Eska's blythe hills, as my lambkins I drove,</br>I spied a young virgin so gay;</br>In beauty she rivall'd the goddess of love,</br>And smil'd like the Queen of the May.", "In rapture I ran, and the shepherdess kiss'd,</br>For who could her glances withstand?</br>So kindly I woo'd, and my love so confess'd,</br>That, blushing, she gave me her hand.", "Now, blythsome together we tend our few sheep:</br>No mortals more chearful and bless'd;</br>Our moments away in soft transports do creep,</br>And ne'er are with sorrow oppress'd.", "O'er mountains and muirlands we wander with joy,</br>Of heart-vexing cares we ne'er dream;</br>In singing a song our spare time we employ,</br>And sporting beside the lov'd stream.", "When roaming along, we remark each sweet flow'r;</br>I ne'er from the virgin dissent:</br>When weary'd with wand'ring we hie to our bow'r,</br>And live still in peace and content.", "More bliss we enjoy in our cottage alone</br>Than treasures of gold can devise;</br>My lot I'd not change for a sceptre or throne,</br>So much I the shepherdess prize.", "At morn when I wake all my fears she dispels,</br>And makes my heart jocund and light;</br>She cheers me all day over forests and fells,</br>And rests in my bosom at night.", "The lovely young shepherdess ne'er did aspire</br>To grandeur, to greatness, or wealth;</br>The villager, Temp'rance, is known for her sire,</br>And shepherds have called her HEALTH.</br>"]
