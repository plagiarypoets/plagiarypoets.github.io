["Picton and Posonby!  a grateful land</br>In her proud annals now records her grief,</br>On arch, urn, obelisk, with trembling hand</br>Your praise indenting.  Thine, no high relief</br>Shall tell, my Brother!  but memorial brief,</br>This humble tribute from Affection due.</br>Whilst England holds the dust of each lov'd Chief,</br>Mine is the reminiscence ever new&mdash;</br>That one small speck is thine in grave-strew'd Waterloo!</br>"]
