["O where are they, whose all that earth could give</br>Beneath these senseless marbles disappeared?</br>Where even they, who taught these stones to grieve;</br>The hands that hew'd them, and the hearts that rear'd?</br>Such the poor bounds of all that's hoped or fear'd,</br>Within the griefs and smiles of this short day.</br>Here sunk the honour'd, vanish'd the endear'd:</br>This the last tribute love to love could pay,</br>An idle pageant pile, to graces pass'd away.", "Why deck these sculptur'd trophies of the tomb?</br>Why, victims, garland thus the spoiler's fane?</br>Hope ye by these to avert oblivion's doom;</br>In grief ambitious, and in ashes vain?</br>Go, rather bid the sand the trace retain,</br>Of all that parted virtue felt and did!</br>Still powerless man revolts from ruin's reign:</br>And pride has gleam'd upon the coffin-lid,</br>And rear'd o'er mouldering dust the mountain pyramid.", "Sink, mean memorials of what cannot die!</br>Be lowly as the relics ye o'erspread!</br>Nor lift your funeral forms so gorgeously,</br>To tell who slumbers in each narrow bed.</br>I would not honour thus the sainted dead;</br>Nor to each stranger's careless eye declare</br>My sacred griefs for joy and friendship fled.</br>O let me hide the names of those that were,</br>Deep in my stricken heart, and shrine them only there!</br>"]
