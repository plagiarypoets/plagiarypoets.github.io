["At noon, when Matilda I meet,</br>Where the chesnut tree spreads its cool shade,</br>While nightingales charm the retreat,</br>Thus I question my delicate maid:</br>\"Have you thought on the theme I address'd</br>In the church way, when no one was by?\"</br>She answers with bosom oppress'd,</br>\"I am thine,\" &mdash; and it comes with a sigh.", "I conjure her to tell me the cause;</br>Is there ought in my manners or mien,</br>Unworthy to meet her applause?</br>Did I slight at the dance on the green?</br>She tells me there's all to approve,</br>Yet a something I see in her eye;</br>And although she declares she can love,</br>Her answer still comes with a sigh.", "If a moment the cause could be known,</br>I would give, &mdash; but have patience awhile,</br>I have nothing to give that's my own,</br>Save the profit that springs from my toil.</br>I surely have found out the cause,</br>When she answers me, prudence is by;</br>Tho' my manners may meet her applause,</br>My poverty wakens the sigh.", "Go Fortune, still 'tend on the great,</br>On the wretch too important to love;</br>Go, bask on the cushions of state;</br>But leave me in anguish to rove.</br>Tho' my heart is sincerely her own,</br>From her presence for ever I'll fly,</br>She shall not be wedded to moan;</br>Lest I couple a tear with a sigh.</br>"]
