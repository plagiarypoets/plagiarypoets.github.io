["Away ye gayer scenes, away,</br>The smiling morn, the garish day;</br>Vanish, thou blazing lamp of light,</br>And bring me black congenial Night.</br>Envelop'd in her gloom, I love</br>Through long resounding ailes to rove:</br>Beneath the dome then lie reclin'd,</br>And feel it tremble to the wind;</br>Hear the wide scatter'd fragments fall</br>From rifted arch, or crumbling wall;</br>While Madness, in fantastic state,</br>Unconscious of impending fate,</br>Beneath the tott'ring ruin sits,</br>And laughs, and weeps, and sings, by fits;</br>Bares to the winds his ghastly form,</br>And courts the horrors of the storm.</br>Ah!  while with devious steps I tread</br>These awful mansions of the dead,</br>What hideous shapes arrest my feet,</br>What beck'ning ghosts my name repeat?</br>They cease; a death-like silence reigns,</br>Freezing the blood within my veins.</br>In this great world am I alone?</br>O!
