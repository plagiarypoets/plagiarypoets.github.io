["Hail, happy sheep!  for in our plains ye feed</br>Secure from every care that us molests;</br>Ye shed no bitter tears,</br>Nor pine with hopeless love;</br>But in your hearts Love follows Nature's law,</br>Without his tortures, ye partake his sweets;</br>Nor do ye ever rue</br>Fallen Ambition's aim;</br>Honor for you hath no attractive charms,</br>Nor selfish interest, nor sly deceit:</br>But all these ills, and more,</br>Betide man's wicked race.</br>Yet man possesses reason that ye want!</br>Meek innocents!  here, trust me, loss is gain:</br>For from it small relief</br>To mortals is deriv'd.</br>No.  This fam'd reason, when the passions rage,</br>But ill defends us:  wine disturbs her rest:</br>And oft the traitress wounds</br>The heart that sought her aid.</br>Severe, yet impotent, against her foes</br>A fragile shield she raises, insecure;</br>But ye have faithful dogs</br>Against the rage of wolves;</br>And better from these savages thy guard,</br>Than from our senses reason.  Lives, like yours,</br>Of sweet forgetfulness,</br>With indolence and ease,</br>Surpass in comforts all the pride of wealth,</br>With birth, and taste, and elegance of form.</br>For oh!  these shadows yield</br>To your substantial bliss!</br>Incessantly they urge us to do wrong,</br>And sad reflection, in the midst of mirth,</br>Dashes the festive cup</br>With gall of dire remorse.</br>The gods of this world man would make eternal.</br>Dull, stupid fool!  Our pleasures, like ourselves,</br>Pass as a summer's breeze,</br>Nor leave a trace behind.</br>No sublunary beings suffer more</br>Th' inconstancy of Fortune; she decides</br>In every stage of life</br>With unresisted sway.</br>Feed on then, gentle sheep, without restraint:</br>Blest in your ignorance, and happier far</br>Than us, who madly boast</br>The epithet of wise.</br>"]
