["Ye shepherds!  (she said, and she sigh'd)</br>And ye nymphs that adorn the sweet scene,</br>Be kind to my kindlings (she cry'd)</br>As they frolickful play on your green.", "For Phillis shall tend them no more,</br>No more their lov'd fleeces behold;</br>How my kids will their feeder deplore,</br>As without me they stray to the fold!", "Adieu to the sweet summer days,</br>And the fleet flying minutes that's past,</br>When Corydon pip'd to my praise;</br>But these hours were too precious to last.", "Yes; &mdash; Corydon stole all my joys,</br>And has left me thus lonely to mourn:</br>Hence I'll fly (for the day-light but cloys)</br>Where a sun-beam will never return.", "And at eve the still arbour I'll court,</br>When each warbler is lull'd on the spray;</br>There, by moon-light, I'll often resort,</br>And list to sweet Philomel's lay.", "Here, Shepherds!  take care of my crook,</br>And come, pipe me some soothing sweet strain,</br>But soft as the murmuring brook</br>That wantonly winds o'er the plain.", "But see! &mdash; yes, 'tis surely his shade!</br>Tho', shepherds, to you he's unseen:</br>I come, my sweet spirit!  (she cry'd)</br>And frantick, flew over the green.</br>"]
