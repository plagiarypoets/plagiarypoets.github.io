["And, even Woe, thy pensive \"influence owns,\"</br>Mixt with the rippling of the oozing cave;</br>While from the threat'ning rock</br>The boding raven croaks:", "Or, when the maniac hears the owls' dire shriek,</br>The fragrance of the vale and fairy tones,</br>Ah, solemn maid!  in vain</br>Thy hushing zephyrs bear.", "Save visions drear, what marks the unattun'd,</br>When village bells proclaim the dying hour;</br>Be it when winter howls,</br>Or summer's tribes buzz round:", "Nor aught, grave Eve!  avail thy soften'd scenes,</br>If Melancholy shall perchance bear sway;</br>The heart thy coming hails,</br>And deepens still its woe:", "While on the sunken tomb and letter'd floor,</br>Still shifting yew-shades trembling melt its gloom,</br>As o'er the moon the breeze</br>Drifts wild the sable clouds;", "And from the ruin'd aisle and yawning vault,</br>The varying voice of horror whispering creeps,</br>Oft as the neighb'ring grove</br>With awful rustling waves:", "Or, on the promontory's shaggy verge,</br>Hung o'er the ceaseless boiling pool below,</br>While from the beetling cliff</br>Collected torrents pour.", "If hideous spectre glare, and paly gleams</br>Flash round and frequent on the frenzied eye!</br>Lost are thy charms, O Eve!</br>Upon the maddening soul.", "Yet, \"gentle Evening mild!\"  sweet is thy power,</br>When peace and feeling meet; thy sombrous sounds</br>In cooling breezes borne,</br>With all thy soothing train.</br>"]
