["Within the commonwealth of trees,</br>There liv'd, in opulence and ease,</br>A Willow and a neighbouring Oak,</br>Two very powerful gentlefolk!</br>The helm of state was all their aim,</br>To which they laid an equal claim.</br>The Willow vain, provok'd at length</br>The sturdy Oak to try its strength:</br>The challenge was received in form,</br>To be decided by a storm.</br>The God of Storms was now addrest,</br>The prowess of each side to test.</br>'Twas granted, as each Willow knows,</br>And now a furious tempest rose,</br>That threaten'd, with disastrous fate,</br>The constitution of the state.</br>The conscious Willow knew, of course,</br>That cringing was his last resource,</br>And bending from the dubious blast,</br>Evaded all its force at least;&mdash;</br>While the firm Oak to fury's tide</br>Opposed its lacerated side;</br>And scorning meanness, with disdain</br>Fell prostrate on the groaning plain.</br>Meantime th' exulting Willow stood,</br>And claim'd the victory o'er the Wood.</br>When thus the firm and stately Oak,</br>In terms of indignation, spoke:&mdash;</br>\"Mean, worthless wretch!  is this thy fort,</br>Each fickle, favouring gale to court,</br>And, with insinuating wile,</br>Of half its force the storm beguile?</br>Not to thy strength, but frail condition,</br>Thou owest thy present elevation.</br>I am an Oak, tho' fall'n, indeed!</br>Thou still a vile and skulking weed!</br>Rais'd by no merit of thy own,</br>But by the blast that laid me prone.</br>Say!  if thou canst, what plant or tree,</br>Except a sycophant like thee,</br>Devoted to intrigue and strife,</br>Would e'er prefer a dastard's life,</br>Preserved by guile and crafty saws,</br>To falling in a GLORIOUS CAUSE.</br>"]
