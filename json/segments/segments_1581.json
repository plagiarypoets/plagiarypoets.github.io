["Sweet Cherwell, from thy crystal tide</br>What note of sorrow meets my ear,</br>While nature laughs in summer's pride,</br>And flings her choicest treasures here!", "Though neighbouring Isis proudly swell</br>By holy towers and forests fair,</br>Though round her banks the muses dwell,</br>And bathe their silver tresses there,", "Thy groves and milder shades beneath</br>Full oft would Warton lie reclin'd,</br>And hear thy waving willows breathe</br>So deeply to the passing wind.", "And here as oft the star of eve</br>Beam'd sweetly in the western sky,</br>His rapid fancy lov'd to weave</br>Some tale of Gothic minstrelsy.", "Then Cherwell flow in native pride</br>Thy vales and secret shades among,</br>Nor envy once thy Sister tide,</br>Her flow'ry banks, her Naiad throng.", "That bard that here so oft before,</br>Of fancy's dreams would take his fill,</br>In death shall haunt this silver shore,</br>And love thy whispering waters still.</br>"]
