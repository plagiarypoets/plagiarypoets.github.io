["Thou!  whom of yore upon their naval prow</br>Themistocles and Cimon saw confest,</br>When Greece made haughty Persia bow,</br>In sky-bright robes of waving azure drest!</br>Whose voice exulting o'er the maid,</br>Red with the blood of thousands slain,</br>Shouted aloud, \"thus ever shall the race</br>Of freedom triumph, when with patriot might</br>They rush indignant to the fight,</br>Resolved with fame to live, or glorious death embrace.\"", "Ethereal Victory!  Jove's darling child,</br>Twin-born with Pallas, when the daring maid</br>Urged on with rout, and terror wild,</br>(The massy spear high-brandish'd o'er her head)</br>That impious crew, whose giant pride</br>All heaven's authentic powers defied:</br>When radiant from successful war,</br>He bade thee sit near his immortal throne,</br>Around thee braced a golden zone,</br>And wreathed thy head with beams pluck'd from the morning star.", "Ethereal Victory!  Oh!  Heed my prayer!</br>By all thy ancient trophies won,</br>By all thy favourite Britain hath achieved,</br>By the deep wounds, which every warrior son</br>Of her's, with extasy hath e'er received,</br>When liberty and justice strove</br>To fire heroic souls with ardent love,</br>By thy own dauntless mind, O goddess swear,</br>Swear, that \"from Calpe to each distant Pole,</br>Where'er the glittering billows roll,</br>Britannia's progeny shall still survey</br>Thy guardian form, thy out-stretch'd arm,</br>Forceful the raging winds to charm,</br>Scatter opposing hosts, and subjugate the sea.\"</br>She swore the mighty oath; to Howe was given</br>To teach, while thunders fierce he hurl'd,</br>The astonish'd Gaul, the listening world,</br>The oath by Victory sworn, and ratified by heaven.</br>"]
