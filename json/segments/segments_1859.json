["Soft voice of Albyn!  round whose spellful lyre,</br>Convened hope's visionary forms erewhile,</br>And owned \"the master's hand, the prophet's fire,\"</br>And blest the song, and saw the future smile;</br>Soft voice of Albyn!  now thy harp's sweet wile</br>To trans-atlantic lay, adjusts the string,</br>And pity's tenderest tear can well beguile,</br>As o'er the ruin'd walls of Wyoming,</br>And gentle Gertrude's fate, its plaintive accents ring.", "The theme how wildly sad!  how meet the lays!</br>Love here, &mdash; for solitude is heaven to love&mdash;</br>Might well the mutual soul to transport raise,</br>And bliss confer, all mortal bliss above&mdash;</br>But the shrill war-trump shook their tranquil grove&mdash;</br>They seek the fort, an ambushed foe appears&mdash;</br>O heaven!  thro' Gertrude's heart the death-ball drove,</br>Even while a bleeding father claims her fears!</br>Alas!  the bridal smile is drowned in blood and tears!", "And see the lovely martyr where she lies!</br>Clasped in her dying arms her dying sire:</br>And, half to pity moved his struggling eyes,</br>Stern Outalissi chaunts his vengeful ire,</br>While widowed Waldegrave, stung with anguish dire,</br>And kneeling near the dead, without control</br>Resigns his heart to grief's consuming fire,</br>As o'er their recent grave the bugle's toll,</br>Waked a wild parting thought, that wrings the very soul.", "Sweet Wyoming!  though desolate to-day,</br>Thy wild-flower shake its chalice to the wind,</br>Yet shall thy ruin live in Campbell's lay,</br>Long as pure love and pity sway mankind.</br>And should, long hence, some Caledonian hind,</br>Seek better home by Susquehanna's wave,</br>\"Here,\" will he proudly deem, with patriot mind,</br>\"Sang Albyn's harp, the lovely, good, and brave\"&mdash;</br>Then wind him o'er the hills, to find poor Gertrude's grave.</br>"]
