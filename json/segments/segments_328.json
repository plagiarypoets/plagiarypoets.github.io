["Hail to thee, glorious rising Year,</br>With what uncommon grace thy days appear!</br>Comely art thou in thy prime,</br>Lovely child of hoary Time;</br>Where thy golden footsteps tread,</br>Pleasures all around thee spread;</br>Bliss and beauty grace thy train;</br>Muse, strike the lyre to some immortal strain.</br>But, oh!  what skill, what master hand,</br>Shall govern or constrain the wanton band?</br>Loose like my verse they dance, and all without command.</br>Images of fairest things</br>Crowd about the speaking strings;</br>Peace and sweet prosperity,</br>Faith and cheerful loyalty,</br>With smiling love and deathless poesy.", "Ye scowling shades who break away,</br>Well do ye fly and shun the purple day,</br>Every fiend and fiend-like form,</br>Black and sullen as a storm,</br>Jealous Fear, and false Surmise,</br>Danger with her dreadful eyes,</br>Faction, Fury, all are fled,</br>And bold Rebellion hides her daring head.</br>Behold, thou gracious Year, behold,</br>To whom thy treasures all thou shalt unfold,</br>For whom thy whiter days were kept from times of old!</br>See thy George, for this is he!</br>On his right hand waiting free,</br>Britain and fair Liberty,</br>Every good is in his face,</br>Every open honest grace.</br>Thou great Plantagenet; immortal be thy race!", "See!  the sacred scyon springs,</br>See the glad promise of a line of kings!</br>Royal youth!  what bard divine,</br>Equal to praise like thine,</br>Shall in some exalted measure</br>Sing thee, Britain's dearest treasure?</br>Who her joy in thee shall tell,</br>Who the sprightly note shall swell,</br>His voice attempering to the tuneful shell?</br>Thee Audenard's recorded field,</br>Bold in thy brave paternal band, beheld,</br>And saw with hopeless heart thy fainting rival yield:</br>Troubled he, with sore dismay,</br>To thy stronger fate gave way,</br>Safe beneath thy noble scorn,</br>Wingy-footed was he borne,</br>Swift as the fleeting shades upon the golden corn.", "What valour, what distinguish'd worth,</br>From thee shall lead the coming ages forth?</br>Crested helms and shining shields,</br>Warriors fam'd in foreign fields;</br>Hoary heads with olive bound,</br>Kings and lawgivers renown'd;</br>Crowding still they rise anew,</br>Beyond the reach of deep prophetic view.</br>Young Augustus!  never cease!</br>Pledge our present and our future peace,</br>Still pour the blessings forth, and give thy great increase.</br>All the stock that fate ordains</br>To supply succeeding reigns,</br>Whether glory shall inspire</br>Gentler arts or martial fire,</br>Still the fair descent shall be</br>Dear to Albion, all, like thee,</br>Patrons of righteous rules, and foes to tyranny.", "Ye golden lights who shine on high,</br>Ye potent planets who ascend the sky,</br>On the opening year dispense</br>All your kindest influence;</br>Heavenly powers be all prepar'd</br>For our Carolina's guard;</br>Short and easy be the pains,</br>Which for a nation's weal the heroine sustains.</br>Britannia's angel, be thou near</br>The growing race is thy peculiar care,</br>Oh spread thy sacred wing above the royal fair,</br>George by thee was wafted o'er</br>To the long expected shore:</br>None presuming to withstand</br>Thy celestial armed hand,</br>While his sacred head to shade,</br>The blended cross on high thy silver shield display'd.", "But, oh!  what other form divine</br>Propitious near the hero seems to shine!</br>Peace of mind, and joy serene,</br>In her sacred eyes are seen,</br>Honour binds her mitred brow,</br>Faith and truth beside her go,</br>With zeal and pure devotion bending low.</br>A thousand storms around her threat,</br>A thousand billows roar beneath her feet,</br>While, fix'd upon a rock, she keeps her sable seat.</br>Still in sign of sure defence,</br>Trust and mutual confidence,</br>On the monarch, standing by,</br>Still she bends her gracious eye,</br>Nor fears her foes' approach, while Heaven and he are nigh.", "Hence then with every anxious care!</br>Be gone, pale Envy, and thou, cold Despair!</br>Seek ye out a moody cell,</br>Where Deceit and Treason dwell;</br>There repining, raging, still</br>The idle air with curses fill;</br>There blast the pathless wild, and the bleak northern hill;</br>There you exile vainly moan;</br>There where, with murmurs horrid as your own,</br>Beneath the sweeping winds, the bending forests groan,</br>But thou, Hope, with smiling cheer,</br>Do thou bring the ready year;</br>See the Hours!  a chosen band!</br>See with jocund looks they stand,</br>All in their trim array, and waiting for command.", "The welcome train begins to move,</br>Hope leads increase and chaste connubial love:</br>Flora sweet her bounty spreads,</br>Smelling gardens, painted meads;</br>Ceres crowns the yellow plain;</br>Pan rewards the shepherd's pain;</br>All is plenty, all is wealth,</br>And on the balmy air sits rosy-colour'd health.</br>I hear the mirth, I hear the land rejoice,</br>Like many waters swells the pealing noise,</br>While to their monarch, thus, they raise the public voice.</br>\"Father of thy country, hail!</br>Always every where prevail;</br>Pious, valiant, just, and wise,</br>Better suns for thee arise,</br>Purer breezes fan the skies,</br>Earth in fruits and flowers is drest,</br>Joy abounds in every breast,</br>For thee thy people all, for thee the year is blest.\"</br>"]
