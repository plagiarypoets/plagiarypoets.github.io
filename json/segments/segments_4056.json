["Hail, high-born virgin, mountain maid!</br>Hail, Fortitude with adamantine mail,</br>Who dost the thickest ranks pervade,</br>Where horrid wounds prevail!</br>Hail, goddess of undaunted brow!</br>Firm as the rugged rock art thou,</br>Which high its head above the billows heaves,</br>Defies the raging winds, and scorns the rushing waves.", "Thee, at a time, when foes on foes</br>Against Britannia, land of freedom, drive</br>With naval arms, and hostile prows,</br>And threaten all alive:</br>Thee, Fortitude, we one and all</br>At this alarming crisis, call</br>Our beating bosoms strongly to inspire</br>With thy intrepid zeal, and thy heroick fire.", "Be present to us, such as when</br>To Agincourt thou didst great Henry lead,</br>Together with his martial men:</br>For still, O warlike maid,</br>The same perfidious enemies</br>Attempt to raze our liberties;</br>The same dire enemies now ride the seas,</br>To strike some sullen blow against our rights and ease.", "Enough is said:  the goddess hears!</br>The British fleet, a hero at its head,</br>Large companies of volunteers,</br>By Fortitude now led,</br>Ready to meet the foes appear,</br>Or, if for fight they should draw near,</br>Ready, bright spirit, under thee to try</br>The glorious work of war:  to conquer or to die!", "So shall posterity, possest</br>Of liberty and of religion pure,</br>In grateful memory, attest</br>What worth did these secure:</br>While viewing the luxuriant field,</br>Which shall its happy harvests yield,</br>Their wives in smiles, their children safe around,</br>They emulate their sires, and guard the goodly ground.</br>"]
