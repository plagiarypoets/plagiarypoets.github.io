["Fair Peace!  descend, and bless our Isle:</br>Make Slaughter cease and Commerce smile,</br>Where War has held his Reign;</br>May Britons on a distant Shore</br>No longer hear the Cannons roar,</br>Nor press th' insanguin'd Plain.", "No more let Mars with purple Hands</br>Destroy the Hinds that till'd the Lands,</br>And sow'd the yellow Grain;</br>Break his dread Spear, his Arms remove,</br>Let Amity and social Love</br>Our former Feuds restrain.", "Ah see!  Britannia's weeping stands</br>With pallid Looks and lifted Hands,</br>While Heroes great in Fight</br>(Who once defy'd proud Gallia's Chain)</br>By Friends, by once-lov'd Brothers slain,</br>Are sunk in endless Night.", "Do thou, mild Pow'r!  our rage controul,</br>Wake tend'rest Passions in each Soul;</br>Remove our dread Alarms:</br>Drive civil Discord far away,</br>Make Nations court thy gentle Sway,</br>And quit their fulgent Arms.", "Oh instant raise propitious Gales</br>To swell the Bark's white-spreading Sails,</br>That wafts to foreign Climes</br>Sage Heroes, taught by Wisdom's Lore,</br>To bid fierce Contests rage no more,</br>That discompose the Times.", "Do thou attend their distant Course,</br>And urge their Suit with lenient Force,</br>To make a Nation bless'd;</br>Let civil Broils no longer Rage,</br>Nor Friends with Friends in War engage;</br>But soothe their Minds to Rest:", "So shall fair Commerce live again,</br>Her Ships shall grace the azure Main</br>With Wealth's exhaustless Store;</br>And Plenty too shall fill the Plains,</br>And glad the hearts of lab'ring Swains,</br>Whose Parents bled before.</br>"]
