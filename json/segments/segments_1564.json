["Vice \"on a solemn night of state,</br>In all the pomp of terror sate,\"</br>Her voice in deep, tremendous tone,</br>Thus issu'd from her ebon throne:</br>This night, at our infernal court,</br>Let all our ministers resort:</br>Who most annoys the human race,</br>At our right hand shall take his place,</br>Rais'd on a throne &mdash; advanc'd in fame&mdash;</br>Ye Crimes now vindicate your claim.", "Eager for praise, the hideous host</br>All spake, aspiring to the post.", "Pride said, to gain his private ends,</br>He sacrific'd his dearest friends;</br>Insulted all with manners rude,</br>And introduc'd ingratitude.</br>'Twas he infus'd domestic hate,</br>And party spirit in the state;</br>Hop'd they'd observe, his mystic plan</br>Destroy'd all confidence in man;</br>And justify'd his high pretensions,</br>By causing envy and dissentions.", "Intemp'rance, loud, demands the place,</br>He'd long deceiv'd the human race;</br>None could such right as he maintain,</br>Disease and death were in his train.", "Theft next appears, to claim the station,</br>E'er constant in his dark vocation;</br>He thought the place might well repay</br>The Crime that labour'd night and day.", "Fraud own'd (though loth to speak his praise)</br>He gain'd his point by secret ways;</br>His voice in cities had been heard,</br>And oft in senates been preferr'd:</br>Yet much derision had he borne,</br>Treated by honest fools with scorn;</br>His influence on the western shore</br>Was not so great as heretofore:</br>He own'd each side alike assail'd,</br>Complain'd how sadly he was rail'd,</br>Curst by the name, in ev'ry street,</br>Of paper, tendry, rogue, and cheat:</br>Yet is some honour should requite</br>His labour &mdash; things might still go right.", "Murder before the footstool stood,</br>With tatter'd robe distain'd in blood;</br>And who, he cry'd, with daring face,</br>Denies my title to the place?</br>My watchful eyes mankind survey,</br>And single out the midnight prey;</br>Not coward-like I meet the foe,</br>With footsteps insecure and slow,</br>Or cause his death by languid strife&mdash;</br>Boldly this dagger ends his life.</br>Give back, ye Crimes:  your claims resign,</br>For I demand the post as mine.", "Av'rice declar'd, for love of gold,</br>His nation, or himself he sold;</br>He taught the sin of pride betimes;</br>Was foster-father of all crimes:</br>He pawn'd his life:  he stak'd his soul,</br>And found employment for the whole:</br>Acknowledged that he gain'd his wealth,</br>By fraud, by murder, and by stealth:</br>On one so useful in her cause,</br>Vice well might lavish due applause.", "The hagger'd host bow low the head;</br>The monster rose, and thus she said:</br>Ye ministers of Vice, draw near,</br>For fame no longer persevere;</br>No more your various parts disclose,</br>Men see, and hate you all as foes,</br>One yet remains among your crew,</br>Then rise, Seduction!  claim your due.</br>Your baneful presence quickly parts</br>The tie which holds the happiest hearts;</br>You rob &mdash; what wealth can ne'er repay!</br>Like Judas, with a kiss betray:</br>Hence come the starving, trembling train,</br>Who prostitute themselves for gain,</br>Whose languid visages impart</br>A smile, while anguish gnaws the heart;</br>Whose steps decoy unwary youth,</br>From honour, honesty, and truth,</br>Which, follow'd 'till too late to mend,</br>In ruin, and the gallows end&mdash;</br>Be thine the post.  Besides, who knows</br>Where all the consequences close?</br>With thee, Seduction!  are ally'd</br>Horror, Despair, and Suicide.</br>You wound &mdash; th' electric pain extends</br>To fathers, mothers, sisters, friends,</br>Murder may yet delight in blood,</br>And deluge round the crimson flood:</br>But sure his merits rank above,</br>Who murders in the mask of love.</br>"]
