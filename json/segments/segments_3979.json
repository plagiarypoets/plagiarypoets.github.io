["Near the foot of a wide spreading yew,</br>Reclin'd at the close of the day,</br>Young Corydon wept, full in view</br>Was the tomb where his dear Nancy lay.", "By his side sat the friend of his heart,</br>And endeavour'd his sadness to cheer;</br>But whilst comfort he strove to impart,</br>Still answer'd each sigh with a tear.", "Well knew he the cause of his grief,</br>And shar'd in his Corydon's woe;</br>But, alas!  he could give no relief,</br>Nor forbid his own sorrows to flow.", "His sorrows flow'd all for his friend,</br>He sigh'd and he wept at his pain,</br>Yet he ceas'd not his plaints to attend,</br>Nor did Corydon cease to complain.", "When first I forsook the gay scene,</br>And fled from the paths of the great,</br>Content in my cottage was seen,</br>And tranquility bless'd my retreat.", "Fair Phillis I saw, and I lov'd,</br>She with smiles fann'd the soft rising flame;</br>Her parents my passion approv'd,</br>And at length Hymen made us the same.", "Together we sought the cool shade,</br>And avoided the sun-garish ray,</br>In Spring we both travers'd the mead,</br>And Winter appear'd but as May.", "Ah!  now all those pleasures are o'er,</br>They are fled like a false golden dream,</br>My Phillis, alas!  is no more,</br>My anguish, what shepherd can blame.", "Why did I such happiness feel,</br>Why did I such pleasure e'er prove;</br>If sorrow press'd close at its heel,</br>If destin'd a victim to love?", "He said &mdash; the cold arrow of death,</br>Put a stop to his tears and his pain;</br>He sigh'd as he yielded his breath,</br>I go to meet Phillis again.</br>"]
