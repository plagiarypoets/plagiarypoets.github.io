["Man's chained to being, though he never sought</br>That spark of immortality within&mdash;</br>That immaterial essence, that is brought</br>To waken dust, then must of course begin</br>To run a round of wickedness and sin.</br>And I unsought-for life must drag along,</br>Though sternly I deny myself akin</br>To aught like flesh; I never herd among</br>That race so dead to feeling &mdash; that degraded throng.", "Although I have the semblance of a man&mdash;</br>Although I wear the aspect of the race&mdash;</br>Although I live and breathe, I never can</br>Be brought to own in them a kindred face,</br>Whose hearts are stamped with folly and disgrace.</br>No!  here I'll unnoticed, and alone</br>On this blank spot, where I can Nature trace&mdash;</br>The snow-wrapt mountain is a happier zone</br>Than man's remorseless breast where pity is unknown.", "For I have been amongst them &mdash; I have seen</br>More than enough for curiosity.</br>The Treachery sits upon a brow serene,</br>And Hatred spits her venom when you see</br>Nought but the smiles of peace and amity,</br>I've seen how cold neglect and scorn is felt</br>By honest worth when link'd to poverty,</br>While crouching parasites in thousands knelt</br>To where Dame Fortune had her goodliest bounties dealt.", "In youth I did possess a friend; but he,</br>When went my house and fortune to decay,</br>Left me to struggle with my misery.</br>Nor he alone, but thousands more who stay</br>While in prosperity, then fled away,</br>And I was friendless!  and a thousand woes</br>Surrounded me, and I became the prey</br>Of my own feelings; but I found repose,</br>And here I'll rest till life's protracted journey close.</br>"]
