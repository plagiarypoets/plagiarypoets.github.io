["O CHARLES, in absence hear a friend complain,</br>Who knows thou lov'st him whereso'er he goes,</br>Yet feels uneasy starts of idle pain,</br>And often would be told the thing he knows.</br>Why then, thou loiterer, fleets the silent year,</br>How dar'st thou give a friend unnecessary fear?", "We are not now beside that osier'd stream,</br>Where erst we wander'd, thoughtless of the way;</br>We do not now of distant ages dream,</br>And cheat in converse half the ling'ring day;</br>No fancied heroes rise at our command,</br>And no TIMOLEON weeps, and bleeds no THEBAN band.", "Yet why complain?  thou feel'st no want like these,</br>From me, 'tis true, but me alone debar'd,</br>Thou still in GRANTA'S shades enjoy'st at ease</br>The books we reverenc'd, and the friends we shar'd;</br>Nor seest without such aids the day decline,</br>Nor think'st how much their loss has added weight to thine.", "Truth's genuine voice, the freely-opening mind,</br>Are thine, are friendship's, and retirement's lot;</br>To conversation is the world confin'd,</br>Friends of an hour, who please and are forgot;</br>And interest stains, and vanity controuls</br>The pure unsullied thoughts, and sallies of our souls.", "O I remember, and with pride repeat</br>The rapid progress which our friendship knew!</br>Even at the first with willing minds we met,</br>And ere the root was fix'd the branches grew,</br>In vain had fortune plac'd her weak barrier,</br>Clear was thy breast from pride, and mine from servile fear.", "I saw thee gen'rous, and with joy can say,</br>My education rose above my birth,</br>Thanks to those parent shades, on whose cold clay</br>Fall fast my tears, and lightly lie the earth!</br>To them I owe whate'er I dare pretend,</br>Thou saw'st with partial eyes, and bade me call thee friend.", "Let others meanly heap the treasur'd store,</br>And aukward fondness cares on cares employ</br>To leave a race more exquisitely poor,</br>Possess'd of riches which they ne'er enjoy:</br>He's only kind who takes the noble way</br>T' unbind the springs of thought and give them pow'r to play.", "His heirs shall bless him, and look down with scorn</br>On vulgar pride from vaunted heroes sprung;</br>Lords of themselves, thank heaven that they were born</br>Above the sordid miser's glitt'ring dung,</br>Above the servile grandeur of a throne,</br>For they are nature's heirs, and all her works their own.</br>"]
