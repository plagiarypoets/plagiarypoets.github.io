["Willy my deare, that late by Haddam sitting,</br>By little Haddam, in those private shades,</br>Unto thy fancie thousand pictures fitting,</br>With dainty Nymphs in those retired glades,</br>Didst spend thy time; (time that too quickly fades)</br>Ah!  much I fear, that those so pleasing toyes</br>Have too much lull'd thy sense and minde in slumbring joyes.", "Now art thou come to nearer Maddingly,</br>Which with fresh sport and pleasure doth enthrall thee;</br>There new delights withdraw thy eare, thy eye;</br>Too much I fear, lest some ill chance befall thee:</br>Heark, how the Cambridge Muses thence recall thee;</br>Willy our deare, Willy his time abuses:</br>But sure thou hadst forgot our Chame, and Cambridge Muses.", "Return now, Willy; now at length return thee:</br>Here thou and I, under the sprouting vine,</br>By yellow Chame, where no hot ray shall burn thee,</br>Will sit, and sing among the Muses nine;</br>And safely cover'd from the scalding shine,</br>We'l read that Mantuan shepherds sweet complaining</br>Whom fair Alexis griev'd with his unjust disdaining:", "And when we list to lower notes descend,</br>Heare Thirsil's moan, and Fusca's crueltie:</br>He cares not now his ragged flock to tend;</br>Fusca his care, but careless enemie:</br>Hope oft he sees shine in her humble eye;</br>But soon her angrie words of hope deprives him:</br>So often dies with love, but love as oft revives him.</br>"]
