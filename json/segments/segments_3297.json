["Alone in an arbour was laid,</br>Young Damon the pride of the dale;</br>While carelessly wrap'd in his plaid,</br>His sighs fill'd each neighbouring vale.", "Ah!  faithless bewitching dear maid,</br>How oft have you lull'd me to sleep;</br>And turn'd my small charge when they've stray'd,</br>Yet left me to murmur and weep!", "Can he who now reigns in your heart,</br>More sweet, soothing pleasures bestow?</br>Or has he a soul to impart</br>More love than I lavish'd on you?", "What though he can boast of more gold,</br>And drive larger teams to the field;</br>Must the heart of my Phoebe be sold?</br>Must affection to avarice yield?", "But ah!  'tis in vain to complain,</br>Or mourn at the fate's hard decree;</br>The winds only hear my sad strain,</br>The winds are more gentle than she.", "Ambition sure taught her to stray,</br>And lonely thus leave me to mourn;</br>The hours that soft glided away,</br>Are gone and shall never return.", "My flocks in some lonely retreat,</br>Still bleating unheaded shall stray,</br>With willows I'll deck me a seat,</br>And list to the Philomel's lay.", "Till worn out with grief and despair,</br>I'll forget every youthful fond scene,</br>And all that my heart has held dear,</br>Shall seem as it never had been.</br>"]
