["Here rests secure, within this narrow Cell,</br>A Youth to Pain and Disappointment known;</br>Pride mock'd his Birth, and Envy smil'd to tell</br>The Hour when Sorrow mark'd him for her own.", "Fix'd on one Object was his Soul sincere;</br>But Heav'n the Recompence of Love deny'd:</br>Long hov'ring o'er th' Extremes of Hope and Fear,</br>Oppress'd by Fate he sunk, despair'd and dy'd!", "No farther seek his Mis'ries to disclose,</br>Nor let pale Envy trample on his Tomb:</br>Here let his hapless Head enjoy Repose,</br>And leave to Mercy and to God his Doom.</br>"]
