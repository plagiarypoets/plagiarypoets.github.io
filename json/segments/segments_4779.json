["Blue-eyed Athena!  what a dream wert thou!</br>Oh!  what a glory hovered o'er thy shrine,&mdash;</br>Thy hill, where darker error nestles, now!&mdash;</br>Yet art thou hallowed, though no more divine!</br>The worship of all noblest hearts is thine,&mdash;</br>Though the dull Moslem haunts the sacred earth</br>Where sprung the olive, o'er its bower of vine,</br>And watched above thine own Cecropia's birth!&mdash;</br>Truth, that should chase such dreams, were, surely, little worth!", "For oh!  thou art the very purest thought</br>That fable e'er conceiv'd! &mdash; and, on thy hill&mdash;</br>Thine own blue hill &mdash; where time and Turk have wrought,</br>In vain, to break the spell that lingers, still,&mdash;</br>The heart that owns a better faith may kneel,</br>Nor wrong his creed, while bending o'er the sod</br>Where gods &mdash; and men like gods, in act and will,&mdash;</br>Are made immortal, by the wizard rod</br>Of him whose very thought aspired to be a god!", "Mount of the free! &mdash; Olympus of the earth!</br>Fair as a temple &mdash; lonely as a tomb!</br>Shall the dark robber rear his household hearth,</br>Where fabled gods contended for a home!</br>&mdash;Those bright abstractions of a truth to come!&mdash;</br>No, by the gift Trazene's monarch gave!</br>No, by the withered olive's early bloom!&mdash;</br>The sea-god's offering calls upon thy brave,</br>Mount, and replant the tree, once more, &mdash; upon the Moslems' grave!</br>"]
