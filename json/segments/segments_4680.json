["My pain while for ease I renew,</br>Ye shepherds attend to the strain,</br>Once careless and jocund as you,</br>I followed my sheep on the plain.", "With joy at the sparrows shrill note,</br>I arose to hail the new day;</br>My sheep I then let from their cote,</br>And piped for the lambkins to play.", "When Philomel sung from her spray,</br>And the blackbird retired to his brake,</br>My reed I attuned to her lay,</br>Or danced with the nymphs at the wake.", "Thus free from all trouble and care,</br>I never was heard to complain;</br>A stranger I was to despair,</br>Till Laura appeared on the plain.", "The force of her charms was so great,</br>The swains at a distance admir'd,</br>The hermit impell'd by his fate,</br>Once saw and ne'er after retir'd.", "Yet equal in beauty and sense:</br>Tho' malice accused her of pride,</br>Her virtues alone gave offence,</br>This falshood had envy contrived.", "Whenever she mentioned the green</br>Or talked of a walk to the grove;</br>I beg'd on my arm she would lean,</br>She smil'd and thus taught me to love.", "Distracted by hope and by fear,</br>My passion at length to declare,</br>I spoke of a friendship sincere,</br>She frown'd and thus taught me despair.", "Ah fate, I receive thy decree:</br>Whole days I now wander alone;</br>Whole nights I sit by some tree,</br>To hear the sad turtle bemoan.", "Ye shepherds, be kind to my sheep;</br>A week they have now been astray:</br>Ill fortune no longer I'll weep</br>My death I'll no longer delay.</br>"]
