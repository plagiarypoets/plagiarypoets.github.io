["Tir'd with the visits of the day,</br>Semanthe on a sofa lay;</br>And leaning on her elbow, thought</br>Which was the loveliest silks she bought;</br>How by Sir Plume she was gallented,</br>How at the park and opera flaunted!</br>What silly hearts she had subdu'd,</br>And how she best might play the prude!</br>Till sleep his heavy poppies spread,</br>Adown she drops her drowsy head!", "Sudden a female phantom rose,</br>Her cheek with healthy roses glows,</br>Her lively eyes are fill'd with fire,</br>Yet modesty forbid desire:</br>Her ebon curls hang loose behind,</br>And laurel-wreaths her temples bind:</br>A snowy robe her limbs array'd,</br>While thus the virgin, Sappho, said.", "&mdash;It grieves me much, alas!  to find</br>The fair neglect t' improve her mind!</br>The toys that your attention claim,</br>A Grecian maid would blush to name:</br>While you're adjusting your commode,</br>Lesbia, or I, could make an ode!</br>No gaudy ribbons deck'd her head,</br>A trembling light no diamond shed;</br>In white and innocency drest,</br>The plainest beauties were the best:</br>A pen I handled for a fan,</br>And learnt not how to dance by scan:</br>Those pretty eyes! &mdash; how soon they close!</br>Those cheeks &mdash; how fades the blushing rose!</br>When age has wean'd your love for dress,</br>And akes and beaus your years confess,</br>When Amoret no more can shine;</br>And Stella owns she's not divine,</br>Then sense and merit shall supply</br>The blushing cheek, the sparkling eye:</br>For nymphs, regardless of their faces,</br>Should add Minerva to the Graces.</br>"]
