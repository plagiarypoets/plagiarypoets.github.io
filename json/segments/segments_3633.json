["Yon little brook that murmurs on its way</br>O'er shining pebbles and through clustered flowers,</br>Hath been to me the source of many a lay,</br>Warbled at times amid its fairy bowers;</br>Appealing to my spirit with a tone</br>Half like the tone of Joy, and half like Sorrow's own!", "How sweetly droops yon willow on its side,</br>Watching its moveless branches in the glass!</br>How bright, how beauteously, the waters glide,</br>Winning my heart to bless them as they pass!</br>And I will bless you, oh ye waters clear!</br>Of many a smile the source, and many a sweeter tear.", "Oh!  not unlike the current of your tide,</br>In this green valley slips my life away;</br>To lofty name and glory unallied,</br>Shunn'd by the rich, and slighted by the gay.</br>Yet, by some faithful and unchanging friend,</br>Watch'd with an eye of love, &mdash; advancing to its end!</br>"]
