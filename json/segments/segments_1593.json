["Harp of the Pats!  that rotting long hast lain</br>On the soft bosom of St. Allen's bog,</br>And, when the Wind had fits, wouldst twang a strain,</br>Till envious mud did all thy musick clog,</br>E'en just as too much pudding chokes a dog;&mdash;</br>Oh!  Paddy's Harp!  still sleeps thine accent's pride?</br>Will nobody be giving it a jog?</br>Still must thou silent be, as when espied</br>Upon an Irish, old, old halfpenny's back side?", "Not thus, when Erin wore a wilder shape,</br>Thy Voice was speechless in an Irish Town;</br>It roused the hopeless Lover to a rape,</br>Made timorous Tenants knock proud Landlords down;</br>Whisky, at every pause, the feast did crown;&mdash;</br>Now, by the powers!  the fun was never slack;</br>The Os and Macs were frisky as the Clown;</br>For, still, the burthen (growing now a hack)</br>Was Hubbaboo, dear joys!  and Didderoo!  and Whack!", "Och!  wake again!  arrah, get up once more!</br>And let me venture just to take a thrum:&mdash;</br>Wake, and be damn'd!  you've had a tightish snore!&mdash;</br>Perhaps, I'd better let you lie there, dumb:</br>Yet, if one Ballad-Monger like my strain,</br>Though I've a clumsy finger and a thumb,</br>I shan't have jingled Minstrelsy in vain;&mdash;</br>So, Wizard, be alive!  old Witch, get up again! . . .</br>"]
