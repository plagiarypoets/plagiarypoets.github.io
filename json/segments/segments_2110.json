the Stain:</br>And when each Hour shall urge his Fate,</br>Thought, like the Doctor, comes too late.", "The Subject of my Song is HEALTH,</br>A Good superior far to Wealth.</br>Can the young Mind distrust its Worth!</br>Consult the Monarchs of the Earth:</br>Imperial Czars, and Sultans, own</br>No Gem so bright, that decks their Throne:</br>Each for this Pearl his Crown would quit,</br>And

they wrought,</br>The Orchard's blushing Pride they brought:</br>Hence in her Face the Lilly speaks,</br>And hence the Rose, which paints her Cheeks;</br>The Cherry gave her Lips to glow,</br>Her Eyes were Debtors to the Sloe;</br>And, to compleat the lovely Fair,</br>'Tis said, the Chesnut stain'd her Hair.", "The Virgin was averse to Courts,</br>But often seen in rural Sports;</br>When in her
