["Ye sacred nymphs, who on Parnassus' top</br>Attune symphonious lyres, thence wont to inspire</br>The daring genius of the laureat bard,</br>Deign you immortal aid; whilst touring high,</br>On wings expanded in the aether born,</br>Of potent Gin's unbounded pow'r, I sing.", "Midst various butts, in phalanx order plac'd,</br>Of rum, from rich Barbadoes fertile coast,</br>Or brandy, produce of the Gallic clime;</br>Whose vivid streams and grateful draughts altern</br>Pleasure redundant yield; the vessel stands,</br>Of monstrous size, huge Heidelbergian tun.</br>O'er these astride the jolly god elate,</br>Young Bacchus with his bloated ruddy cheeks</br>Triumphant sits; with verdant wreaths entwin'd</br>His dizzy head, and opiate runlett crown'd.</br>To this as to the Delphian shrine erst flock'd</br>Myriads, to scan the events of future deeds,</br>So fast the rabble rout transported come:</br>Hither resort the jocund songsters blithe</br>That thro' the streets their merry ballads chant.</br>Oft here I've seen the lees of mortal race,</br>Whom want and hunger, dread companions, ey'd</br>With ghastly grin askance, quaff the rich juice,</br>Till the strong fumes intoxicate their brain:</br>Then he who late in cottage darkling dwelt,</br>Or cell obscure by glimmering ray scarce own'd;</br>Majestic pomp exerting, now assumes</br>Despotic sway; and with unsteady steps</br>Vaunting aloud, his regal will declares,</br>And an imaginary monarch reigns.</br>The humble mendicant in tatter'd garb</br>Of variegated hue, to brumal blasts</br>And penury, the poor man's guide, inur'd;</br>If the small pittance of his plaintive tone</br>Can purchase but a glass of potent gin,</br>His sole ambition's gain'd; nor splendid dress</br>Nor robes attractive of plebeian eyes</br>His admiration claim; benumming cold</br>No more he feels, but spurns the hoary frost;</br>And strait, unmindful of his former state,</br>Rapt in ecstatic bliss, exulting runs.</br>When from some street we hear melodious strains</br>Of Wallfleet oysters usher in the eve,</br>We thence to Gin's diffusive voice strength ascribe</br>The shrill stentorian voice.  Bellona's sons</br>Inspir'd by this, midst arms refulgent rush,</br>Braving the discord of the jarring helms;</br>And meet undaunted in terrific forms,</br>The meagre visage of unhidebound death.</br>But more its all-dispensing power's invok'd,</br>When mortals early to their labours haste;</br>Whilst cold Arcturus and the frozen wain</br>Shed influence unperceiv'd by human ken</br>I' th' spangled hemisphere; e'er Phoebus mounts</br>In bright Aurora's lap, his glaring car,</br>That with unerring circuit measures out</br>Grateful vicissitude of day and night.</br>Mean while th' imperious dames with jovial crew</br>Of prattling females, round a maple stool</br>Sipping vast goblets of belov'd bohea,</br>Their sland'rous news with never ceasing din</br>Promiscuous tell, till a reviving glass</br>Of this salubrious juice their malice stems,</br>And puts a period to their sage debates.</br>Nor does it to the ignoble motly herd</br>Confine its virtues; oft the rich it cheers</br>Whilst wine and brandy unregarded stand.</br>Inspir'd by this, the weary traveller</br>Benighted on the verge of danger tost,</br>Walks unappal'd amidst the noon of night:</br>Thro' drifts of snow the Caledonian loon</br>Maugre the force of blustring Boreas stalks</br>Disdainful, with a draught of this elate,</br>And whiff of foul Mundungus, stinking weed.</br>Its power Ierne's sons o'er boggy moors,</br>And Cambro-Britons on the naked tops</br>Of mountains bleak, with front serene display,</br>Secure with this 'midst elemental jars.", "Hail mighty Gin, thou health preserving dram!</br>Of warmth productive, plenteous and cheap,</br>From gentle Thames to Danube's torrent fam'd.</br>Hail!  melancholy's foe, delightful bane</br>To pannic fear and care with furrow'd brow;</br>If the chaste bounds of moderation guide</br>Man's reason, else all good it strait subverts;</br>And human nature feels the dire effects,</br>Plung'd in abyss of woe and conscious shame.</br>"]
