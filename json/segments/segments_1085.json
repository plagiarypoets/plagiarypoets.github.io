["A Pert young hazle once bespoke,</br>In terms like these, a sturdy oak:", "What lofty branches still are spread,</br>Around your vast extensive head;</br>And what a piece of fertile ground,</br>Your root encompasses around;</br>Your bulk, how vast, but pray what use</br>Does all your mightiness produce?</br>So horrid brackish is your fruit;</br>While I, a low and simple tree,</br>A pigmy unto giant thee,</br>A pleasing milky burthen bear,</br>Admir'd by all the young and fair,</br>Who ever listen to the cry,</br>Of hazle-nuts, come crack and try!</br>But when were acorns ever known,</br>Thus to be sung about the town.</br>Were I the farmer, well I know</br>I'd send you somewhere else to grow,</br>Nor let you longer thus expand,</br>To over-shadow half my land;</br>And in your place I'd hazle put,</br>There is some profit in a nut.", "Thou empty thing, the oak reply'd,</br>I answer but to check thy pride;</br>For 'tis beneath an oak like me,</br>To answer such a twig as thee:</br>Know, from my trunk are bulwarks made,</br>Employ'd to distant worlds in trade;</br>Or when invidious foes appear,</br>I o'er the ocean thunders bear;</br>When fleets engage in fire and smoke,</br>Would hazles do as well as oak:</br>A vessel formed of wood of thee,</br>Call it &mdash; the nut-shell of the line.</br>Your emptiness no longer shew,</br>To talk of what you do not know;</br>Crack of your nut, but crack no jokes</br>In future with us tough old oaks;</br>A sapling gather'd from my head,</br>If well apply'd, would strike thee dead.", "To fops and fools the moral's shewn,</br>Boast not what trifles are your own.</br>"]
