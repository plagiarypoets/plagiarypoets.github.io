["The simplest reed which nature's minstrel loves</br>Beneath some pastoral shade to woo the spring,</br>Or welcome summer, round whose plenteous brows</br>The earth's best fruits are seen,", "Will not be heard by thee, O Winter foul!</br>Whose storms arising from the blasting south</br>Numb all its powers, and with their dreary yells</br>Out-drown its untaught voice.", "As dun October, foremost of thy train,</br>By Boreas warn'd, his naked figure spread,</br>And led by Eurus, in his snow-lin'd car,</br>Begins thy frozen march;", "While Autumn shrinking from his rude embrace,</br>O blasting Winter waves his sallow hair,</br>And wildly views thee wrapt in cloudy veil</br>With threat'ning looks approach.", "To chain with icy fingers bath'd in dew</br>Each streamlet once so tuneful to its banks,</br>And hang on every mount or valley's side</br>Thy snowy banners grey;", "Or quench with foul November's foggy breath</br>The sky's clear azure, and its golden light,</br>While nature, joyless like a widow, mourns</br>Thy ruthless withering touch.", "Now, while thy terrors rob the frighted earth,</br>And nip each floweret which emblazon'd the vale,</br>And from the trees their latest foliage green</br>With frantic fury tear,", "Let me retire within some sylvan cell,</br>Where peace and science make their blest abode,</br>And round the social hearth with friendship drawn,</br>Seek refuge from their power.", "And there let Fancy, sweetest nymph, her smiles</br>Dispense, and spread her choicest hues around,</br>Such as by Shakspeare's sun beam'd eyes</br>In rainbow vestures clad:", "While Solitude, the hermit queen, shall tell</br>How pleasure most in shadiest haunts is found,</br>And health shall court me with her ruddiest hue,</br>And mirth my temper crown.", "Then Hope shall point with Fancy's fairy eye,</br>Where Spring, on rosy sandals dancing light,</br>Comes on, and drives thee, Winter, from our plains</br>To bleak Siberia's isle.</br>"]
