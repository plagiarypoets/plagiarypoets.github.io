self;</br>And hath so many Shepherds in her See,</br>To hear thee sing, a simple silly Elf?</br>Or be the Shepherds which do serve her laisie?</br>That they list not their merry Pipes apply?</br>Or be their Pipes untunable and craisie,</br>That they cannot her honour worthily?", "Ah nay, said Colin, neither so nor so:</br>For better Shepherds be not under skie,</br>Nor better able, when they list to blow</br>Their Pipes aloud, her Name to glorifie.</br>There is good Harpalus, now woxen aged</br>In faithful Service of fair Cynthia;</br>And there is Coridon, but meanly waged,</br>Yet a blest Wit

grew.</br>And there is Alabaster, throughly taught</br>In all his Skill, though knowen yet to few:</br>Yet were he known to Cynthia as he ought,</br>His Eliseis would be read anew.</br>Who lives that can match that heroick Song,</br>Which he hath of that mighty Princess made?</br>O dearest Dread, do not thy self that wrong.</br>To let thy Fame lie so in hidden shade;</br>But call it forth, O call

all the Brood of Greece fo highly prais'd,</br>Can match that Muse, when it with Bayes is crown'd,</br>And to the pitch of her Perfection rais'd.</br>And there is a new Shepherd late up sprong,</br>The which doth all afore him far surpass;</br>Appearing well in that well-tuned Song,</br>Which late he sung unto a scornful Lass.</br>Yet doth his trembling Muse but lowly flie,</br>As daring not too rashly mount on hight,</br>And doth her tender Plumes as yet but trie</br>In Love's soft Layes, and looser Thoughts delight;</br>Then rouze thy Feathers quickly, Daniel,</br>And to what course thou please thy self advance:</br>But most, me seems, thy Accent will excel</br>In tragick Plaints and passionate Mischance.</br>And there that Shepherd of the Ocean is,</br>That spends his Wit in Love's consuming Smart:</br>Full sweetly tempred is that Muse of his,</br>That can impierce a Prince's mighty Heart.</br>There also is (ah no, he is not now!)</br>But since I said he is, he quite

Invention,</br>Doth like himself heroically sound.</br>All these, and many others moe remain,</br>Now after Astrofell is dead and gone;</br>But while as Astrofell did live and reign,</br>Amongst all these was none his Paragon:</br>All these do florish in their sundry kind,</br>And do their Cynthia immortal make;</br>Yet found I Liking in her royal Mind,</br>Not for my Skill, but for that Shepherd's sake.", "Then spake a lovely Lass, hight Lucida:</br>Shepherd, enough of Shepherds thou hast told,</br>Which favour thee, and honour Cynthia;</br>But of so many Nymphs which she doth

Woods, and murmuring Waters-fall,</br>Her Name I'le teach in knowen Terms to frame:</br>And eke my Lambs, when for their Dams they all.</br>I'le teach to call for Cynthia by name.</br>And long while after I am dead and rotten,</br>Amongst the Shepherds Daughters dauncing round,</br>My Lays made of her shall not be forgotten,</br>But sung by them with flowry Girlonds crown'd.</br>And ye, whoso ye be, that shall survive,</br>When as ye hear her Memory renew'd,</br>Be witness of her Bounty here alive,</br>Which she to Colin her poor Shepherd shew'd.", "Much was the whole Assembly of those Heards</br>Mov'd at his Speech, so feelingly he spake;</br>And stood awhile astonish'd at his Words,</br>Till Thestylis at last their Silence brake,</br>Saying, Why Colin, since thou found'st such Grace</br>With Cynthia, and all her noble Crew,</br>Why didst thou ever leave that happy Place,</br>In which such Wealth might unto thee accrew?</br>And back returnedst to this barren Soil,</br>Where Cold, and Care, and Penury do dwell,</br>Here to keep Sheep with Hunger and with Toil:</br>Most wretched he, thee is and cannot tell.", "Happy indeed, said Colin, I him hold,</br>That may that blessed Presence still enjoy,</br>Of Fortune and of Envy uncontroul'd,</br>Which still are wont most happy States t' annoy:</br>But I by that which little while I prov'd,</br>Some part of those Enormities did see,</br>The which in Court continually hoov'd,</br>And follow'd those which happy seem'd to be.</br>Therefore I silly Man, whose former Days</br>Had in rude Fields been altogether spent,</br>Durst not adventure such unknowen Ways,</br>Nor trust the Guile of Fortune's Blandishment;</br>But rather chose back to my Sheep to tourn,</br>Whose utmost Hardness I before had try'd,</br>Than having learn'd Repentance late, to mourn</br>Emongst those Wretches which I there descry'd.", "Shepherd, said Thestylis, it seems of spight</br>Thou speakest thus 'gainst their Felicity,</br>Which thou enviest, rather than of right</br>That ought in them blame-worthy thou doost spy.", "Cause have I none, quoth he, of cancred will</br>To quit them ill, that me demean'd so well:</br>But Self-regard of private Good or Ill,</br>Moves me of each, so as I found, to tell,</br>And eke to warn young Shepherds wandring Wit,</br>Which through report of that Life's painted Bliss,</br>Abandon quiet Home, to seek for it,</br>And leave their Lambs to loss, misled amiss:</br>For sooth to say, it is no sort of Life,</br>For Shepherd fit to lead in that same Place,</br>Where each one seeks with Malice and with Strife,</br>To thrust down other into foul Disgrace,</br>Himself to raise:  and he doth soonest rise</br>That best can handle his deceitful Wit,</br>In subtil Shifts, and finest Sleights devise,</br>Either by slandring his well-deemed Name,</br>Through Leasings leud, and feigned Forgery;</br>Or else by breeding him some blot of Blame,</br>By creeping close into his Secrecy:</br>To which him needs, a guileful hollow Heart,</br>Masked with fair dissembling Curtesy,</br>A filed Tongue, furnish'd with Terms of Art;</br>No Art of School but Courtiers Schoolery.</br>For Arts of School have there small Countenance,</br>Counted but Toys to busy idle Brains;</br>And there Professors find small Maintenance,</br>But to be Instruments of others Gains.</br>Ne is there place for any gentle Wit,</br>Unless to please, it self it can apply:</br>But shouldred is, or out of door quite shit;</br>As base, or blunt, unmeet for Melody.</br>For each Man's Worth is measur'd by his Weed,</br>As Harts by Horns, or Asses by their Ears;</br>Yet Asses be not all, whose Ears exceed,</br>Nor yet all Harts, that Horns the highest bears.</br>For highest Looks have not the highest Mind,</br>Nor haughty Words most full of highest Thought:</br>But are like Bladders blowen up with Wind,</br>That being prick'd do vanish into nought.</br>Even such is all their vaunted Vanity</br>Nought else but Smoke, that fumeth soon away:</br>Such is their Glory that in simple Eye</br>Seem greatest, when their Garments are most gay.</br>So they themselves for Praise of Fools do fell,</br>And all their Wealth for Painting on a Wall;</br>With Price whereof they buy a golden Bell,</br>And purchase highest Rooms in Bower and Hall:</br>Whiles single Truth and simple Honesty</br>Do wander up and down, despis'd of all;</br>Their plain Attire such glorious Gallantry</br>Disdains so much, that none them in doth call.", "Ah Colin, then said Hobbinol, the blame</br>Which thou imputest, is too general;</br>As if not any gentle Wit of name,</br>Nor honest Mind might there be found at all.</br>For well I wot, sith I my self was there,</br>To wait on Lobbin (Lobbin well thou knewest)</br>Full many worthy ones then waiting were,</br>As ever else in Prince's Court thou viewest.</br>Of which, among you many yet remain,</br>Whose Names I cannot readily now guess:</br>Those that poor Suters Papers do retain,</br>And those that Skill of Medicine profess:</br>And those that do to Cynthia expound</br>The Ledden of strange Languages in charge;</br>For Cynthia doth in Sciences abound,</br>And gives to their Professors Stipends large.</br>Therefore unjustly thou doost wite them all,</br>For that which thou mislikest in a few.", "Blame is, quoth he, more blameless general,</br>Than that which private Errors doth pursue:</br>For well I wote, that there amongst  them be</br>Full many Persons of right worthy Parts,</br>Both for Report of spotless Honesty,</br>And for Profession of all learned Arts,</br>Whose Praise hereby no whit impaired is,</br>Though Blame do light on those that faulty be;</br>For all the rest do most-what fare amiss,</br>And yet their own misfairing will not see:</br>For either they be puffed up with Pride,</br>Or fraught with Envy, that their Galls do swell.</br>Or they their Days to Idleness divide,</br>Or drowned lie in Pleasure's wasteful Well;</br>In which, like Moldwarps, nousling still they lurk,</br>Unmindful of chief parts of Manliness,</br>And do themselves for want of other Work,</br>Vain Votaries of lazy Love profess;</br>Whose Service high so basely they ensue,</br>That Cupid's self of them ashamed is,</br>And mustring all his Men in Venus' view,</br>Denies them quite for Servitors of his.", "And is Love then, said Corilas, once known</br>In Court, and his sweet Lore professed there?</br>I weened sure he was our God alone,</br>And only woon'd in Fields and Forests here.", "Not so, quoth he, Love most aboundeth there;</br>For all the Walls and Windows there are writ</br>All full of Love, and Love, and Love, my Dear,</br>And all their Talk and Study is of it.</br>Ne any there doth brave or valiant seem,</br>Unless that some gay Mistress' Badg he bears:</br>Ne any one himself doth ought esteem,</br>Unless he swim in Love up to the Ears.</br>But they of Love and of his sacred Lere</br>(As it should be) all otherwise devise,</br>Than we poor Shepherds are accustom'd here,</br>And him do sue and serve all otherwise.</br>For with leud Speeches and licentious Deeds,</br>His mighty Mysteries they do profane,</br>And use his idle Name to other needs,</br>But as a Complement for courting vain.</br>So him they do not serve as they profess,</br>But make him serve to them for sordid Uses.</br>Ah!  my dread Lord, that dost liege Hearts possess,</br>Avenge thy self on them for their Abuses.</br>But we poor Shepherds, whether rightly so,</br>Or through our Rudeness into Error led,</br>Do make Religion how we rashly go,</br>To serve that God that is so greatly dread:</br>For him the greatest of the Gods we deem,</br>Born without Sire or Couples, of one Kind;</br>For Venus' self doth solely Couples seem,</br>Both Male and Female, through commixture join'd.</br>So, pure and spotless Cupid forth she brought,</br>And in the Gardens of Adonis nurs'd;</br>Where growing, he his own Perfection wrought,</br>And shortly was of all the Gods the first.</br>Then got he Bow and Shafts of Gold and Lead,</br>In which so fell and puissant he grew,</br>That Jove himself his Power began to dread,</br>And taking up to Heaven, him goaded new.</br>From thence he shoots his Arrows every where</br>Into the World, at random, as he will,</br>On us frail Men, his wretched Vassals here,</br>Like as himself us pleaseth save or spill.</br>So we him worship, so we him adore,</br>With humble Hearts to Heaven up-lifted hie,</br>That to true Loves he may us evermore</br>Prefer, and of their Grace us dignify:</br>Ne is there Shepherd, ne yet Shepherd's Swain,</br>Whatever feeds in Forest or in Field,</br>That dare with evil Deed or Leasing vain,</br>Blaspheme his Power, or Terms unworthy yield.", "Shepherd, it seems that some celestial Rage</br>Of Love, quoth Cuddy, is breath'd into thy Breast,</br>That poureth forth these Oracles so sage,</br>Of that high Power wherewith thou art possest.</br>But never wist I till this present day,</br>Albe of Love I always humbly deem'd,</br>That he was such an one as thou doost say,</br>And so religiously to be esteem'd.</br>Well may it seem by this thy deep Insight,</br>That of that God the Priest thou shouldest be:</br>So well thou wot'st the Mystery of his Might,</br>As if his Godhead thou didst present see.", "Of Love's Perfection perfectly to speak,</br>Or of his Nature rightly to define,</br>Indeed, saith Colin, passeth Reason's reach,</br>And needs his Priest t' express his Power Divine.</br>For long before the World he was ybore,</br>And bred above, in Venus' Bosom dear:</br>For by his Power the World was made of yore,</br>And all that therein wondrous doth appear.</br>For how should else things so far from attone,</br>And so great Enemies as of them be,</br>Be ever drawn together into one,</br>And taught in such Accordance to agree?</br>Through him the Cold began to covet Heat;</br>And Water Fire; the Light to mount on hie,</br>And th' Heavy down to poize; the Hungry t' eat,</br>And Voidness to seek full Satiety.</br>So being former Foes, they wexed Friends,</br>And 'gan by little learn to love each other:</br>So being knit, they brought forth other Kinds</br>Out of the fruitful Womb of their great Mother.</br>Then first 'gan Heaven out of Darkness dread</br>For to appear, and brought forth cheerful Day:</br>Next 'gan the Earth to shew her naked Head</br>Out of deep Waters, which her drown'd alway.</br>And shortly after, every living Wight</br>Crept forth, like Worms, out of their slimy Nature,</br>Soon as on them the Sun's life-giving Light</br>Had poured kindly Heat and formal Feature.</br>Thenceforth they 'gan each one his like to love,</br>And like himself desire for to beget;</br>The Lion chose his Mate, the Turtle-Dove</br>Her Dear, the Dolphin his own Dolphinet:</br>But Man, that had the Spark of Reason's Might,</br>More than the rest, to rule his Passion,</br>Chose for his Love the fairest in his Sight;</br>Like as himself, was fairest by Creation.</br>For Beauty is the Bait which with Delight</br>Doth Man allure, for to enlarge his Kind;</br>Beauty the burning Lamp of Heaven's Light,</br>Darting her Beams into each feeble Mind;</br>Against whose Power, nor God nor Man can find</br>Defence, ne ward the Danger of the Wound:</br>But being hurt, seek to be medicin'd</br>Of her that first did stir that mortal Stownd.</br>Then do they cry and call to Love apace,</br>With Prayers loud importuning the Sky,</br>Whence he them hears; and when he list shew Grace,</br>Does grant them Grace, that otherwise would die.</br>So Love is Lord of all the World by Right,</br>And rules the Creatures by his powerful Saw:</br>All being made the Vassals of his Might,</br>Through secret Sense which thereto doth them draw.</br>Thus ought all Lovers of their Lord to deem,</br>And with chaste Heart to honour him alway:</br>But whoso else doth otherwise esteem,</br>Are Out-laws, and his Lore do disobey.</br>For their Desire is base, and doth not merit</br>The name of Love, but of disloyal Lust:</br>Ne 'mongst true Lovers they shall place inherit,</br>But as Exuls out of his Court be thrust.", "So having said, Melissa spake at will,</br>Colin, thou now full deeply hast divin'd</br>Of Love and Beauty, and with wondrous Skill</br>Hast Cupid's self depainted in his kind.</br>To thee are all true Lovers greatly bound,</br>That doost their Cause so mightily defend;</br>But most, all Women are thy Debtors found,</br>That doost their Bounty still so much commend.", "That ill, said Hobbinol, they him requite:</br>For having loved ever one most dear,</br>He is repaid with Scorn and foul Despite,</br>That yrks each gentle Heart which it doth hear.", "Indeed, said Lucid, I have often heard</br>Fair Rosalinde of divers fouly blamed;</br>For being to that Swain too cruel hard,</br>That her bright Glory else hath much defamed.</br>But who can tell what Cause had that fair Maid</br>To use him so, that loved her so well?</br>Or who with Blame can justly her upbraid,</br>For loving not?  For who can Love compel?</br>And sooth to say, it is fool-hardy thing</br>Rashly to witen Creatures so Divine;</br>For Demi-gods they be, and first did spring</br>From Heaven, though Graft in Frailness feminine.</br>And well I wote, that oft I heard it spoken,</br>How one that fairest Helene did revile,</br>Through Judgment of the Gods, to been ywroken,</br>Lost both his Eyes, and so remain'd long while,</br>Till he recanted had his wicked Rimes,</br>And made amends to her with treble Praise:</br>Beware therefore, ye Grooms, I read betimes,</br>How rashly Blame of Rosalinde ye raise.", "Ah Shepherds, then said Colin, ye ne weet</br>How great a Guilt upon your Heads ye draw;</br>To make so bold a Doom with words unmeet,</br>Of thing Celestial, which ye never saw.</br>For she is not like as the other Crew</br>Of Shepherds Daughters, which emongst you be,</br>But of divine Regard and heavenly Hue,</br>Excelling all that ever ye did see.", "Not then to her that scorned thing so base,</br>But to my self the blame that looks so hie:</br>So high her Thoughts as she her self have place,</br>And loath each lowly thing with lofty Eye.</br>Yet so much Grace let her vouchsafe to grant</br>To simple Swain, sith her I may not love;</br>Yet that I may her Honour paravant,</br>And praise her Worth, though far my Wit above.</br>Such Grace shall be some Guerdon for the Grief</br>And long Affliction which I have endured;</br>Such Grace sometimes, shall give me some Relief</br>And Ease of Pain, which cannot be recured:</br>And ye my fellow-Shepherds, which do see</br>And hear the Languors of my too long dying,</br>Unto the World for ever witness be,</br>That hers I die; nought to the World denying</br>This simple Trophy of her great Conquest.", "So, having ended, he from Ground did rise,</br>And after him uprose eke all the rest:</br>All loth to part, but that the glooming Skies</br>Warn'd them to draw their bleating Flocks to rest.</br>"]
