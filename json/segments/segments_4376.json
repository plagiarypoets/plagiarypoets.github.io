["One morn as I stray'd thro' the grove,</br>A nymph to a shepherd did say,</br>\"Your passion I ne'er can approve,</br>Kind Corydon leave me, I pray;</br>For I have much cause to lament,</br>Alexis, fond youth, is no more</br>For ever, adieu!  to content,</br>His death I am doom'd to deplore.", "\"But had I his passion return'd,</br>The love I had for him confest,</br>His death now I ne'er should have mourn'd,</br>Alexis and I had been bless'd:</br>The season of pleasure is o'er,</br>Alas!  it is follow'd by pain,</br>Alexis, fond youth, he is dead,</br>Each shepherd repeats on the plain.", "\"My Phillida, oft would he say,</br>Oh!  pity a lover sincere!</br>The birds seem'd to list' on the spray,</br>When he did his passion declare.</br>But, Corydon yonder I see,</br>The lasses that follow the bier;</br>Adieu!  I a mourner will be,</br>His grave I'll bedew with a tear.\"</br>"]
