["Here, in this waving, solitary shade,</br>Where Flora's fragrant bloom around is spread,</br>In fairest splendours of the night display'd,</br>When liquid dews a silver lustre shed,</br>And every flow'ret by their balm is fed,</br>Calm Solitude may find a pleasing seat,</br>And muse on rosy joys for ever fled;</br>And on those fleeting dreams of rapture sweet,</br>Which spread delusive paths before our wand'ring feet.", "May I wild stray far from the giddy world,</br>Through scenes where Nature's lovely beauties shine,</br>And gaze on Night's star-spangled plume unfurl'd,</br>Displaying soft refulgent line divine;</br>And when the moon-beams one the waves recline,</br>Sleeping calmly beneath their glancing ray,</br>Then in a bower where blooms the weeping vine,</br>How sweet to rest, and view the glistening spray.</br>In sparkling glow, deep-tinted azure, mild display.", "I love by Ocean's lonely shores to glide;</br>To hear shrill blasts of deep winds howling by,</br>To see the swan on waves majestic ride,</br>And listen to the owlet's plaintive cry;</br>Or o'er the deep to view the curlew fly</br>On wings of white unto her cliff-built nest;</br>And by the mountain where dark shadows lie,</br>I love to roam, and lay me down to rest,</br>On beds with dewy, crimson, primrose flow'rets drest.</br>"]
