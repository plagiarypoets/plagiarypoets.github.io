["When first I fair Ruby beheld,</br>My heart was quite free and serene;</br>I thought she all maidens excell'd</br>In beauty, in shape, and in mein;</br>How happy was I if I caught,</br>The glance of her beautiful eye,</br>The cause of it often I sought,</br>But knew not, and could not tell why.", "Too late, yet alas, I soon found</br>The reason of her I approv'd;</br>Sly Cupid had got me fast bound,</br>And Ruby, the maiden, I lov'd:</br>Peace fled from my pillow at night,</br>I knew not in truth what to do;</br>I us'd all my power and might</br>To bid the sweet maiden adieu.", "As oft as she vow'd she'd be mine,</br>I call'd on the powers above,</br>And swore I would ne'er her resign,</br>But she should alone be my my love.</br>Yet fickleness dwelt in the maid,</br>She forgot me, she lov'd me no more;</br>You must her for ever upbraid,</br>If my sorrows you ever deplore.", "Contentment's blest cottage I sought,</br>Was sure I could never it find;</br>No girl upon earth then I thought,</br>Would ever be constant and kind:</br>How near allied joy and despair,</br>As the calm still succeeds to the gale;</br>For I found one both true and sincere,</br>In the gloomy recess of a gaol.", "Oh thou!  to this heart ever dear!</br>Thou faithful!  thou constant and true!</br>I'll never forget all the care,</br>I receiv'd, and experienc'd from you;</br>When a fever was burning my frame,</br>Friends, reason, alas!  were no more;</br>Dear Peggy by me would remain,</br>Till her care did my senses restore.", "Ah!  Scotia, your Pride loud bewail,</br>And Angus your child too deplore,</br>Fair Beauty your loss now reveal,</br>The lass of Montrose is no more:</br>Those charms shall no longer engage,</br>That captive led princes away;</br>For the envy and pride of the age,</br>Is mouldering now into clay.", "Weep, gratitude!  weep to her shade!</br>And friendship go sobbing along!</br>Drop, pity, a tear to the maid,</br>That was once all the pride of my song.</br>To her mem'ry dear I shall rear,</br>The tribute now left to bestow;</br>And ever, for ever, declare</br>My life to poor Peggy I owe.</br>"]
