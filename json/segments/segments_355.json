was,</br>No meane defense, but a magnifick grace</br>Unto the Sacred Hill:  this Regiment,</br>On summons short, was ever ready bent</br>To execute Apollo's just commands,</br>With hearts couragious, and with armed hands.</br>Stout Tasso did in sturdy buffe appeare,</br>And after reverence done, desir'd to heare</br>His Graces pleasure; who soone gave him orders,</br>With all his Cavalry, to scoure the borders</br>Of high Parnassus, and low Helicon,</br>And to bring in alive, or dead, each one</br>That had discovered been, or to defile</br>The Presse with Pamphlets scarrilous, and vile,</br>Or to have traduc'd with malignant spirits,</br>Persons of honorable worth, and merits.</br>Tasso departs with these instructions,</br>And muster'd up his witty Myrmidons:</br>The trumpet to the stirrop gives a call:</br>They bustle to their armes, and mounted all,</br>Haste to their Rendezvous without delay,</br>And put in ranke, and file, they march away:</br>For Tasso no advantage did decline,</br>To prosecute the better his designe;</br>Hee into squadrons three his Troopes dissects,</br>And unto severall quarters them directs,</br>That traversing the countrey round about,</br>They might the sooner find these foxes out;</br>In each suspicious angle Tasso seekes,</br>And in this inquisition spent some weekes:</br>Nor did his other parties with neglect</br>Performe what they injoyn'd were to effect;</br>The limits of Parnassus they surround,</br>And Helicon, with verdant Laurells crown'd:</br>Mount Pindus, and those valleys ever greene</br>Where pale Pyrene, and pure Hippocrene</br>In liquid crystall rise, they search'd throughout;</br>Nor was the Vale of Tempe left unsought:</br>Nor did their labours misse successe desir'd:</br>For they, before a moneth was full expir'd,</br>Had clear'd the coasts, and many pris'ners gain'd;</br>Which malefactors they in chaines detain'd,</br>And them convey'd unto Apolloes Court,</br>Who welcom'd Tasso in most gratious sort:</br>And for his faithfull service, him hee made</br>Lieutenant Generall of that proud Brigade</br>Of the Italian Poets:  This reward</br>Made elder Dante, and Petrarch to regard</br>His dignitie with ill affected eyes:</br>And Ariosto discontent likewise:</br>But Phoebus did brave Tasso's merit weigh</br>By reason, but in scales of passion they;</br>And when hee did perceive that they did fret,</br>To see themselves behind their Junior set,</br>Hee them assur'd they must expect t' inherit</br>Parnassus honours not by time, but merit.</br>But when Apollo with his radiant looke</br>The Pris'ners had into amazement strooke,</br>Hee caus'd those guiltie soules to bee convey'd</br>To the Trophonian denne, there to bee laid</br>In Irons cold, untill they should bee brought</br>To tryall for those mischiefs they had wrought.</br>Apollo then a solemne summons sent</br>To all those honour'd Peers that did frequent</br>The Learned Hill, and strictly them injoyn'd,</br>Him to attend, upon a day assign'd:</br>For in a full Assise hee did intend</br>The crimes of these delinquents to perpend:</br>His loyall Nobles fail'd not, to resort</br>(Without delay) unto their Soveraignes Court,</br>And on the day, which was for judgement set,</br>They all in the Praetorian hall were met:</br>Where Phoebus, on his high tribunall sate,</br>With his Assessours, in triumphant state;</br>Sage Verulam sublim'd for science great,</br>As Chancellour, next him had the first seat:</br>And next to him, Budeus did appear,</br>Hee of Parnassus was High Treasurer:</br>Sidney tooke place upon the other side,</br>Who th' office of High Constable supply'd:</br>But Picus of Mirandula, (who was</br>High Chamberlaine) assumed the fourth place;</br>The elder Scaliger his place then tooke</br>Before Erasmus, who shew'd in his looke</br>Distaste, for hee (like Pompey) tooke displeasure:</br>To see himselfe put downe by Julius Cesar.</br>In cuerpo then did Justus Lipsius sit,</br>Who more devotion had exprest then wit,</br>When to an Image hee bequeath'd his gown,</br>But had hee not been for a Turnecoate known,</br>His offer'd garment might have found esteeme,</br>Which fitter for a Frippery did seeme,</br>Then for her use, to whom it was presented.</br>Next him sate Barclay, somewhat discontented,</br>'Cause hee had fail'd in finding that respect,</br>Which hee from Romes Archflamen did expect.</br>Bodine, Turnebus, Casaubon, and Grotius,</br>Mascardus, Heinsius, Selden, Vossius,</br>Approved Criticks all, did there appeare</br>On the judiciall Bench with lookes severe.</br>But when old Camden thought to take his place,</br>Apollo him repuls'd with some disgrace:</br>For hee of late receiv'd had a complaint</br>From hands of credit, which did him attaint</br>Of misdemeanours, acted in a story,</br>That did detract from a Great Ladies glory,</br>Wherein hee was accus'd to have reveal'd</br>Some things, which better might have been conceal'd</br>Had they been truths:  What madnesse him misled,</br>T' asperse the ashes of that Phoenix dead,</br>With notes of infamy, whose fun'rall flame</br>Ravish'd the world with th' odour of her fame?</br>Doubtlesse the living hee to flatter knew,</br>Much better then to give the dead her due.", "(The Court thus set) the sturdy Keeper then</br>Of the unhospitall Trophonian Den,</br>His trembling Pris'ners brought unto the barre;</br>For sterne aspect, with Mars hee might compare,</br>But by his belly, and his double chinne,</br>Hee look'd like the old Hoste of a New Inne.</br>Thus when sowre Ben his fetter'd cattell had</br>Shut up together in the pinfold sad:</br>John Taylour, then the Courts shrill Chanticleere,</br>Did summon all the Jurours to

Then Sylvester,</br>Sands, Drayton, Beaumont, Fletcher, Massinger,</br>Shakespeare, and Heywood, Poets good and free;</br>Dramatick writers all, but the first three:</br>These were empanell'd all, and being sworne</br>A just and perfect verdict to returne,</br>A Malefactour then receiv'd command,</br>Before the Barre to elevate his hand;</br>Mercurius Britanicus by name,</br>Was hee, who first was call'd to play his game:</br>Then Edmund Spenser Clarke of the Assise,</br>Read the Endictment loud, which did comprise</br>Matters of scandall, and contempt extreme,</br>Done 'gainst the Dignitie, and Diademe</br>Of great Apollo, and that legall course,</br>Which throughout all Parnassus was in force.</br>For use of Mercury hee was accus'd,</br>Which weekely hee into his inke infus'd,</br>Thereby to murther, and destroy the fame</br>Of many, with strange obloquie, and shame.</br>Hee likewise was accus'd, to have purloin'd</br>Some drachmes of wit, with a felonious mind,</br>From Helicon, which hee in Satyrs mixt,</br>To make some laugh, and others deepely vext.</br>Unto his charge they likewise did object,</br>That when hee saw his lines could not effect</br>His ends, and aymes, which were his foe to kill,</br>Or else to make him throw away his quill;</br>That then hee sought by magick Arts to call</br>Archilochus his ghost from Pluto's hall,</br>To teach him how such language to indite,</br>As might make some even hang themselves for spite.</br>This was his charge in brief; (which being read)</br>To his indictment he was call'd to plead:", "Not guilty, he replies, and did submit</br>Himselfe to the integrity and wit</br>Of twelve sufficient Poets, but entreated,</br>To heare the Jurours names againe repeated:</br>(Which done) hee on exceptions did insist,</br>Asserted against divers of the list.</br>On confident George Withers first hee fix'd,</br>As one unfit with others to bee mix'd</br>In his arraignment, for he did protest,</br>That Withers was a cruell Satyrist;</br>And guilty of the same offence and crime,</br>Whereof hee was accused at this time:</br>Therefore for him hee thought it fitter farre,</br>To stand as a Delinquent at the barre,</br>Then to bee now empanell'd in a Jury.</br>George Withers then, with a Poetick fury,</br>Began to bluster, but Apollo's frowne</br>Made him forbeare, and lay his choler downe.</br>But Phoebus, thus Britanicus corrects,</br>Our Majesty (said hee) which still protects</br>The innocent, but doth offendours scourge,</br>Ingag'd is honest Withers for to purge</br>From this offence:  for his impartiall pen</br>Did rather grosse abuses taxe, then men:</br>Or that hee did transgresse, let us admit;</br>Since long agoe, hee smarted for his wit.</br>Nor was Britanicus with this abash'd,</br>For with his cavils hee sought to have dash'd</br>Two other able Jurours, and these were</br>Deserving Sands and gentle Sylvester:</br>To these opprobious language hee affords,</br>And them Translators call'd, and men of words,</br>No Poets, but meer Rhymers, for (said hee)</br>Invention is the soule of poesie,</br>And who can say, that such a soule as this,</br>Is to bee found in their abilities?</br>For these are bondmen to anothers stile,</br>And when they have bestow'd much time, and toile,</br>They doe but what, before, was better done;</br>For Poemes lose by their translation,</br>And are deprived of that lustre brave,</br>Which their originalls are wont to have:</br>Yea all the workes of these Translators vaine,</br>Are rather labours of the hand, then braine:</br>Their asinine endeavours have effected,</br>That nobler tongues and arts are now neglected;</br>While they in vulgar language represent</br>Those notions which from vulgar wits dissent:</br>This knot of Knaves the Common-wealth afflicts</br>Of your Parnassus with their jugling tricks;</br>For Rubies which in gold at first were set,</br>They into copper put, whereby they cheat</br>The simpler sort, that want a piercing eye,</br>The difference of metals to descry.</br>Thus spake Britanicus:  while many smil'd;</br>But Sands look'd pale, and Sylvester wax'd wild</br>For anger and disdaine; Apollo then</br>Thus interpos'd, to vindicate these men,</br>Britanicus (said hee) we have too long</br>The language heard of thy traducing tongue,</br>But Sylvesters, and Sands his worth is such,</br>That thy reproach cannot their honour touch:</br>Since Kings for Majesty, and arts renown'd,</br>Have with receptions kind, their labours crown'd.</br>Besides, wee are inclin'd by some respects,</br>Challeng'd from us, by the infirmer sex,</br>These writers of Parnassus to support,</br>To please the fancy of that female sort,</br>Whom want of these translations might spurre on,</br>For to acquire, and get more tongues then one:</br>Which if they should accomplish, men might rue</br>Those mischiefes which would thereupon ensue.</br>But if nor Sands, nor Sylvester can merit,</br>The titles of true Poets to inherit,</br>For what they have perform'd, yet wee relie</br>So much upon their truth, and loyaltie,</br>That wee cause them to passe upon thy tryall,</br>In spite of thy exception or denyall.</br>Thus spake Apollo:  then the Pris'ner was</br>Injoyn'd to stand aside, and in his place</br>Did Aulicus succeed, who by command,</br>In humble sort uprear'd his guilty hand:</br>Full sadly his indictment he attends,</br>Which him impeach'd, that hee for wicked ends</br>Had the Castalian Spring defil'd with gall;</br>And chang'd by witchcraft, most Satyricall,</br>The bayes of Helicon, and myrtles mild,</br>To pricking hauthornes, and to hollyes wild.</br>Hee was accus'd, that he with slanders false,</br>With forged fictions, calumnies and tales,</br>Had sought the Spartane Ephori to shame,</br>And added fewell to the direfull flame</br>Of civill discord, and domesticke blowes,</br>By the incentives of malicious prose.</br>For whereas, hee should have compos'd his inke</br>Of liquours, that make flames expire, and shrinke</br>Into their cinders, it was there objected,</br>That hee had his of burning oile confected,</br>Of Naphtha, Gunpowder, Pitch, and Saltpeter,</br>Which those combustions raised, and made greater.</br>Hee was accus'd to have unjustly stung</br>The sage Amphictyons with his venom'd tongue;</br>And that he like the fierce Albanian curre,</br>Did stubbornly choose rather to demurre,</br>And bee dismembred by anothers wit,</br>Then loose his teeth from those, whom first hee bit.</br>Hee was accus'd, that he had us'd his skill,</br>Parnassus with strange heresies to fill,</br>And that he labour'd had for to bring in,</br>Th' exploded doctrines of the Florentine,</br>And taught that to dissemble and to lie,</br>Were vitall parts of humane policie:</br>Of his endictment this was the full sense:</br>To which the Pris'ner pleades his innocence,</br>And puts himselfe upon a legall tryall,</br>But he withall exhibites a denyall</br>Against a Jurour, for his suit it was,</br>That May on his arraignment might not passe:</br>For though a Poet hee must him confesse,</br>Because his writings did attest no lesse;</br>Yet hee desir'd hee might be set aside,</br>Because hee durst not in his truth confide:</br>Of May among twelve moneths he well approv'd,</br>But May among Twelve men hee never lov'd:</br>For hee beleev'd that out of private spite</br>Hee would his conscience straine, t' undoe him quite.</br>Hee likewise of offences him accus'd,</br>Whereby his King Apollo was abus'd:</br>And with malicious arguments attempts</br>To prove him guilty of sublime contempts,</br>But chiefly he indeavour'd to conclude,</br>That hee was guilty of ingratitude:</br>Which crime Parnassus Lawes doe so oppose,</br>As in that State, it for high Treason goes.</br>Then May stept forth, and first implor'd the grace</br>And leave of Phoebus to maintaine his case:", "Then to the Learned Cunsistory sues,</br>That they would him or censure, or excuse:</br>Then calls the Gods, and all whom they protect,</br>The Starres, and all on whom they doe reflect,</br>The Elements, and what's compos'd of these,</br>Him to acquit from all disloyalties.</br>If by just proofes (said hee) thou canst evince,</br>That I have beene ungratefull to my Prince,</br>Then let mee from these groves bee now exil'd</br>To Scythian snowes, or into deserts wild;</br>Yea, I invoke the Gods that I may feele</br>The Gyants valour, or Ixions wheele,</br>If it bee found I have transgressed thus,</br>As 'tis inform'd by lying Aulicus.</br>Apollo then darts forth an awfull ray</br>From his impiercing eye, which silenc'd May.</br>So Kings (if they bee just) may rule like Gods,</br>And be observed by their lookes, and nods.</br>Hee Aulicus rebuk'd, because hee knew</br>His accusation from meere malice grew:</br>And him advis'd in peace to stand aside,</br>If hee desir'd with favour to be try'd.</br>The Cryer then did summon to the Bar,</br>The Penman of the Weekely Calendar,</br>Entituled the new Ephemerides,</br>Perfect Diurnalls call them, if you please;</br>But their perfection cannot mee invite,</br>To thinke they merit such an Epethite,</br>Except truths now for imperfections passe,</br>And gold in estimation yeelds to brasse.", "Of his endictment the whole summe was this,</br>That hee had wrong'd th' Athenian Novelists,</br>By selling them meere aire, in stead of Sack,</br>And puffes of wind, for strong Frontigniac:</br>For empty bottles hee was wont to mixe</br>Among full flasques, and with these cheating trickes</br>Deceiv'd those Merchants, who were not so wise</br>To know the full from empty by the poise.</br>A fourth Delinquent then was called out,</br>A Second Proteus or the learned Scout:</br>This wise Chamaeleon was wont to weare</br>That hue, which was propounded by his feare:</br>The summe of his indictment this contain'd;</br>That whereas hee had from Apollo gain'd</br>A Patent to report true newes abroad,</br>Without dissimulation, guile, or fraud,</br>Yet hee adulterated had his ware</br>With manifold impertinences rare,</br>Yea from his center swarv'd, and gone astray</br>Into some matters farre beyond his way:</br>And that hee with eight Pages undiscreet,</br>Had toss'd and tax'd high actions in a sheet:</br>That he prognosticks had presum'd to reare,</br>On starres above his quadrant, and his spheare:</br>And that he had presum'd likewise to mixe</br>With his Avisoes sweet, soure politicks,</br>Dispersing weekly maximes of State,</br>As if he chiefly at the helme had sate:</br>And that he had oft in ambiguous fashions,</br>Appear'd as one transform'd in his relations,</br>That it was very difficult to find,</br>Whether he were a bird, or beast by kind:</br>He was accus'd, that he with censures bold,</br>The actions of his betters had controld,</br>And that he with his mercenary hand,</br>Had touch'd affaires of weight not to be scann'd</br>By such as hee:  thus was the Scout indited,</br>But when he was unto his answer cited,</br>Hee pleads himselfe to be an Innocent,</br>And humbly crav'd the Bench for to consent</br>To his impunity, and to dispence</br>With errours, that arise from indigence:</br>He further added; since his fate it was</br>To be referr'd for tryall of his case</br>Unto twelve mouthes; he crav'd they would admit</br>Twelve noses too; him to condemne, or quit,</br>That no defect might be of any sence,</br>To smell, or to find out his innocence.</br>Apollo then retorts an irefull glance,</br>And dash'd the Pris'ner out of countenance:</br>He told him now 'twas time to lay aside</br>Impertinent discourse, he should be tryd</br>By twelve, who were sufficient Men, and fit</br>Both for integrity, and pregnant wit:</br>And as for him, whose Vote he did reject,</br>Upon a cavill against some defect:</br>Hee him assur'd that all the world might know,</br>His art was high, although his nose was low:</br>But Madagascar chiefly did express</br>His raptures brave, and laur'ate worthiness.</br>The Scout commanded was then to stand by:</br>And Civicus held up his hand on high:</br>Good civill Civicus, who to his booke</br>Emblemes affix'd, of what he undertooke,</br>For silly rimes appear'd in the first place,</br>To which was added some Commanders face,</br>That in resemblance, did no more comply</br>With him, whom it was said to signifie,</br>Then doe some storyes which his books containe,</br>Resemble truths:  But his offences vaine,</br>In his endictment were declar'd at large,</br>And this was the full purport of his charge;</br>He was accus'd that he through science bad,</br>Or Magick, or Magnetick figures, had</br>Prefixed to his books; which did enchant</br>The fancies of the weak, and ignorant,</br>And caus'd them to bestow more time, and coine,</br>On such fond Pamphlets, then on books divine:</br>It was affirm'd, that he was wont to scatter,</br>Upon his single sheet, more words, then matter,</br>And that he had with transmarine narrations,</br>Recruted his domesticall relations,</br>And from the Danes and Swedes fetch'd cold discourse</br>To cloy the stomacks of his Auditours;</br>And with such stuffe his latter pages patch'd,</br>That they Brittannicus his doctrines match'd,</br>Who doubts, and satisfactions wont t' invent,</br>That gave nor satisfaction nor content.</br>While Civicus did thus his tryall heare;</br>One comes, and whispers Phoebus in the eare,</br>And him advertis'd, that a secret friend</br>Of Civicus, did to his Highness send,</br>A present of some Sack, and sugar loaves,</br>And that therewith, the Giver humbly moves,</br>That the poore Pris'ner might receive such grace,</br>As might be justly found in such a case.</br>Apollo then, in choler and disdain,</br>Did thus break out in termes.  What madness vain,</br>Or impudence (said He) in humane race</br>Remains?  That they should think with bribes t' efface</br>Our resolutions just, and us divert</br>From judgement by the law, and by desert;</br>Then he the Gaoler call'd for (Honest Ben)</br>The Keeper fat, of the Trophonian Den:</br>Him he commands to seize upon (in hast)</br>The bringer of the bribe, and keep him fast;</br>And since the Tubbe of which he told the tale,</br>By splitting, had deceiv'd him of his ale;</br>And since his New-Inne too had got a crack,</br>He bids him take the Sugar loves, and Sack,</br>To make his lov'd Magnatick Lady glad,</br>That still (for want of an applause) was sad.</br>Then Civicus unto his charge did plead</br>Not guilty, and was bidden to recede.", "Then with a look like to his style submisse,</br>Stood forth, the Writer of Occurrences:</br>He was accused to have injur'd Fame,</br>And to have disguis'd falshood by the name</br>Of Truth, and with a goodly Frontispeice,</br>To have procur'd his bookes esteeme, and price:</br>Which were compar'd unto a painted Inne,</br>That had nor good wine, nor good cheare within.</br>He was accus'd, that like a subtile theife,</br>He had his readers rob'd of their beleife,</br>And of their wit, and judgment them bereav'd,</br>That willingly, were with his lies deceiv'd:</br>But if some truths (by chance) he utter'd had,</br>These were in such a tedious language clad,</br>That many actors of renowned jests,</br>Depriv'd were of their honor'd interests,</br>By his inglorious penne, and also those</br>Who did affect true elegance in prose,</br>Did from his rustick phrase conceive more hate,</br>Then pleasure from those things he did relate.</br>It likewise was deliver'd in his charge,</br>That he had tortur'd, with his letters large,</br>Ingenious eares, which to plebeian hands</br>He captives made, in auscultations bands.</br>And that mens names, on credit he up tooke,</br>All which he listed to fill up his booke,</br>And for to make a greater noise, he summes</br>Both Trumpets,

with that vulgar train", "The Pris'ners plea to this indictment was</br>Flat negative, for in the plainest case,</br>Al Malefactors hate confession free,</br>Confesse and hang is still their maxime.</br>The Pris'ner also crav'd, he might be heard,</br>While he against a jury-man preferr'd</br>A just exception, his request was granted,</br>And fraught with malice, though much wit he wanted,</br>He gentle Mr. Cary did refuse,</br>Who pleas'd faire Ladies with his courtly muse:</br>He said, that he by his luxurious penne,</br>Deserv'd had better the Trophonian Denne,</br>Then many now which stood to be arraign'd,</br>For he the Thespian Fountaine had distain'd,</br>With foule conceits, and made their waters bright,</br>Impure, like those of the Hermophrodite,</br>He said, that he in verse, more loose had bin,</br>Then old Chaerephanes, or Aretine,</br>In obscaene portraitures:  and that this fellow</br>In Helicon had reard the first Burdello,</br>That he had chang'd the chast Castalian spring,</br>Into a Carian Well, whose waters bring</br>Effeminate desires, and thoughts uncleane,</br>To minds that earst were pure, and most serene,</br>Thus spake the pris'ner, when a furious glance,</br>Was darted from Apollos countenance,</br>Which strook him dumb:  then Scaliger the wise</br>Was call'd, to whom Apollo thus aplies</br>His Speech, Grave Censour of our learned Hill</br>Whom your owne merit, and our royall will</br>Hath supervisour made of Arts, and Muses,</br>I wonder at the noise of these abuses,</br>For I conceive not yet, that these effects,</br>Should be th' unhappy fruites of your neglects,</br>So well you 'ave purg'd the errours of the Times,</br>That I think not you could permit such crimes,</br>Our manners to corrupt, since that our springs</br>Ought to be kept as pure as beds of Kings:</br>For he that vice, with science doth commixe,</br>Turnes noble Hippocren' to ugly Styx,</br>In marriage bonds hoth Heaven and Hell combine</br>Yet Art may Heaven and earth together joyne:</br>Thus spake Apollo, then learn'd Scaliger</br>Shap'd the replye:  I have (my Soveraigne deare)</br>With care intended what concerns my place,</br>So to conserve your springs from mixtures base,</br>Yet all my care, and labour is but vaine,</br>Except Jove will consent t' undoe againe</br>His worke of Humane nature, and the same</br>Of such pure stuffe, and perfect temper frame,</br>As it of no corruption may admit:</br>For I have try'd my industry and wit,</br>Both Arts, and Authours to refine, and mend,</br>As well as times, yet can I not defend,</br>But some luxuriant witt, will often vent</br>Lascivious Poems, against my consent:</br>Of which offence, if Cary guilty be,</br>Yet may some chaster Songs him render free</br>From censure sharp, and expiate those crimes</br>Which are not fully his, but rather Times:</br>But let your Grace vouchsafe, that he may try</br>How he can make his own Apology:</br>Apollo then gave Cary leave to speake,</br>Who thus in modest sort, did silence breake.", "In wisdomes nonage, and unriper yeares,</br>Some lines slipt from my penne, which since with teares</br>I labour'd to expunge:  This Song of mine</br>Was not infused by the Virgins nine,</br>Nor through my dreames divine upon this Hill,</br>Did this vain Rapture issue from my quill,</br>No Thespian waters, but a Paphian fire,</br>Did me with this foule extasie inspire:</br>I oft have wish'd, that I (like Saturne) might</br>This Infant of my folly smother quite,</br>Or that I could retract, what I had done,</br>Into the bosome of Oblivion.</br>Thus Cary did conclude:  for prest by griefe,</br>Hee was compell'd to be concise, and briefe:</br>Phoebus at his contrition did relent,</br>And Edicts so on through all Parnassus sent,</br>That none should dare to attribute the shame</br>Of that fond rapture, unto Caryes name,</br>But Order'd that the infamy should light</br>On those, who did the same read, or recite.</br>Hee further-more the Pris'ner did injoyne,</br>Against him all exceptions to decline,</br>And to a legall tryall for to stand,</br>If Hee expected favour at his hand.", "The innocent Scotch Dove did then advance,</br>Full sober in his wit, and countenance,</br>And though his books contain'd not mickle sence,</br>Yet his endictment shew'd no great offence;</br>Great Wits, to perills great themselves expose</br>Oft' times; but the Scotch Dove was none of those:</br>In many words he little matter drest,</br>And did Laconick brevity detest,</br>Perspicuous phrase he lov'd, could not endure</br>To be in stile, or in his life obscure,</br>But while his Readers did expect some newes,</br>They found a Sermon, thus did he abuse</br>Good people, that he rather might have took</br>A Lapwing, then a Dove to trimme a book:", "This was his charge:  and being call'd to plead,</br>Hee cryes not guilty, and petitioned</br>He might be heard to vindicate his worth</br>From scandall, and reproach, on him cast forth</br>By Aulicus, that scoffing Hipponax,</br>Who with lewd crimes, did him unjustly tax;</br>His sute was granted, then did he complaine</br>That Aulicus, his title did disdaine,</br>And spitefully in stead of Scottish Pigeon,</br>Had him the nick-name given of Scottish Wigion,</br>And that he had most falsly him accus'd,</br>Prestigious Arts, and Magick to have us'd,</br>Whereby Mens senses were with errours strook,</br>That firebrands, they for Olive branches took.", "Thus spake the Dove:  Apollo then reply'd,</br>Wee might condemne your arrogance, and pride,</br>'Cause you the name of Venus birds have chose,</br>When Scotland hath (you know) no birds like those,</br>Though it abounds with fowle of various kinds;</br>But errours small provoke not heavenly minds,</br>I doubt not, but that Aulicus his tongue</br>Hath injur'd you, but were this all the wrong</br>Which it hath done, He might our censure scape,</br>And passe, not for a Serpent, but an Ape.</br>Thus Phoebus spake; And then the Scottish Dove</br>Rejoyn'd, as zeale and choler did him move;", "I challenge to the duell of the pen</br>False Aulicus, that Cynick among men,</br>That enemy of Truth, true honours scourge,</br>That Officine of lyes, and slanders forge,</br>Oh let your Grace vouchsafe to turne me loose,</br>A Scottish Dove, against the Romish Goose.</br>Apollo then reflects a frowning eye,</br>Commands him to desist, and to stand by.", "The Cryer then did the swift Post command,</br>At his indictment to hold up his hand:</br>He was accus'd of these enormities,</br>First that with Encheridions of lyes,</br>He had disturb'd the learned Common-weale,</br>And also in felonious sort did steale</br>From Euphues, and Arcadia, language gay</br>Therein his vain relations to array,</br>Because he knew that lyes in fine attires,</br>Preferr'd are before truths, by many buyers:</br>Such was his style, such tales did he endite,</br>That he no newes, but Romants seem'd to write;</br>It also strongly was against him urg'd,</br>That he some Packets had contriv'd, and forg'd,</br>Which letters did of false reports containe,</br>And this was meerely done for thirst of gaine:</br>This was his charge; and because he divin'd</br>That free confession might some favour find,</br>Hee guilty pleads, and then was set aside.</br>Another then was call'd forth to be try'd:</br>And this was he, who weekly did dispence</br>A miscellany of intelligence:</br>Of his endictment, the effect was this,</br>That he had with his weekly rapsodyes,</br>The Asses of Parnassus sore annoy'd,</br>Whom he had fed with many rumours voyd,</br>And vapours vain.  Thus like Chamelions they</br>Took smoke in stead of provender and hay,</br>And therby grew in sence so leane, and lame:</br>That quite unfit for service they became;</br>It was alleadg'd, that he for lucres sake,</br>Did false intelligence devise, and make,</br>And car'd not who he gul'd, or did beguile,</br>Soe he might reap therby some profit vile.", "These were the crimes, wherof he was accus'd</br>To which he pleads not guilty, but refus'd</br>By Histriomicke Poets to be try'd,</br>'Gainst whom, he thus maliciously enveigh'd", "Justice (sayd he) and no sinister fury,</br>Diswades me from a tryall by a jury,</br>That of worse misdemeanours guilty bee,</br>Then those which are objected against mee:</br>These mercinary pen-men of the Stage,</br>That foster the grand vises of this age,</br>Should in this Common-wealth no office beare,</br>But rather stand with us Delinquents here:</br>Shakespear's a Mimicke, Massinger a Sot,</br>Heywood for Aganippe takes a plot:</br>Beamount

so lewdly:</br>And while 'mongst these, the murmure did encrease,</br>The Cryer warn'd them all to hold their peace.", "The Court was silent, then Apollo spake:</br>If thou (said He) chiefly for

judgement brought,</br>To suffer for those crimes, which they have wrought,</br>Thus spake the Soveraign of the two-topp'd Mount,</br>Another then was call'd to an account,</br>And this was he, who weekly did pretend,</br>Accounts of certain news abroad to send.</br>He was accus'd, that he with Pamphlets vain,</br>The art of lying had sought to maintain,</br>Which trade, he and his fellows us'd of late,</br>With such successe, and profit in the State</br>Of high Parnassus, that they did conspire,</br>A Patent from Apollo to acquire:</br>That they might thus incorporated bee,</br>Into a Company of Lyers free.</br>This was his charge:  while he no whit relents,</br>But stood to justifie his innocence.</br>The Pen-man of the Perfect Passages</br>Then to his tryall did himselfe addresse,</br>He was accus'd, that he for love of gain,</br>Had injur'd Truth, with many stories vain,</br>And that Hee with his mercenary quill,</br>Dishonour'd had Apollo's Noble Hill.</br>That Hee, and his associates had attempted</br>In a felonious manner, to have empty'd</br>The Fountaines of the Muses, to fulfill</br>That appetite which rose from Livers ill.</br>To this indictment he gave a denyall,</br>And yeelds himselfe submissively to his tryall.", "The subtile Spye then to the barre drew nere,</br>And with dejected lookes, his hand did reare:</br>But he in his indictment was accus'd,</br>Old Galilaeos glasses to have us'd,</br>Which represented objects to his eye,</br>Beyond their measure, and just symmetrie,</br>Whereby the faults of many did appeare,</br>More and farre greater, then indeed they were:</br>And that he at a distance did recount,</br>(Like Lynceus from the Lilybean mount)</br>Numbers of shipps and men, though he indeed</br>So blind was, that he did a leader need.</br>He was accus'd that (like Aglauros) hee</br>Forbidden objects had presum'd to see,</br>And therefore merited in law, and sence,</br>His eares to forfeit, for his eyes offence.", "Thus

Poly-Olbion which he writ,</br>This he tearm'd a rude Embrion of wit,</br>A peice of low esteeme, together layd</br>Without propicious Pallas, or the ayde</br>Of the nine Muses, who did much disdaine</br>The homely features of his Naiad's vaine.", "Thus spake the Spye, and still would have proceeded</br>If that Apollo had not him impeded.</br>I thinke through th' insolence of these (said

foule:  But as the Ermines spotts</br>Adde price and estimation to his Furre,</br>Soe the reproofes of this invective curre</br>Give light, and lustre unto Draytons worth,</br>And with advantage set his merit forth:</br>Drayton, who doth, in such magnificke sort</br>Delineate Valour in his Agincourte,</br>That this illustr'ous poeme, doth inspire</br>Even courages of ice, with warlike fire.</br>His Tragicke Legends are with force endu'd,</br>To soften Scythyans, and Tartars rude,</br>Yea with pathetick Fancies to enchant</br>Obdurate mindes:  and hearts of Adamant,</br>His vertue's so sublime, that even as soon,</br>The Savage Negro's darts may peirce the Moone,</br>As the invectives of this froward Spye,</br>A drachme of worth, take from his merit high.</br>Thus spake Apollo:  while old Drayton smil'd</br>To see him curb'd that had him thus revil'd.", "Now when the Jurours had distinctly heard</br>Each Bill, that was against these men preferr'd,</br>They then commanded were

chose,</br>Who confident was, both in verse and prose;</br>He did not like a Custard, quake and quiver,</br>When he his verdict came for to deliver:</br>And first, of him it was enquired,

proceed against him must.</br>He crav'd his book, but that was him deny'd;</br>It was his book (they said) which him destroyd.</br>Nor was this Pris'ner onely guilty found,</br>For all his consorts heard the self-same sound.</br>Apollo then after a conflict high,</br>Between his justice, and his clemency,</br>Not without ebullition of some teares,</br>Thus sentence gave upon the Prisoners.</br>Britanicus condemn'd was to be led,</br>To that place where the Porcupines were fed,</br>Where to a post fast bound, he must remaine,</br>Till with their quils, they had him shot and slaine.", "But Aulicus, Apollo did condemne,</br>To be transported to the fatall Denne</br>Which kept those Vipers, from all parts collected,</br>Of which Parnassus Treacle was confected.", "For when Apollo did long since descry,</br>That Fortune, and the World did much envy</br>The learned crew, and them to Limbo sent,</br>Oft through the poison of deep discontent</br>Hee through his skill in physick did devise</br>This Antidote against all maladies;</br>And for this end he did those vipers cherrish,</br>Among which now, poore Aulicus must perish:", "But the sly Scout, a gentler censure found,</br>(Apollo with such mildnes did abound)</br>For he was destin'd to this punishment;</br>He to the Vale of Hybla must be sent,</br>There to protect the hives of Thrifty Bees,</br>From the Invasions and the Larcenies,</br>Of Waspes and Hornets; but t'was ordered too</br>That he starke naked, must this service doe,</br>And he these Robbers only must assaile,</br>With the long feather of a Capons taile,", "The wise Intelligencer then did heare</br>His sentence, which seem'd somewhat too severe:</br>For he condemn'd was to a Scullions place,</br>Within the Kitchen of Appollos grace;</br>Where he was forc'd his papers to expend,</br>Piggs, Pyes, and Geese, from burning to defend.</br>But Civicus was sentenc'd to be gone,</br>Both from Parnassus and from Helicon,</br>And to the Fennes of Lerna was confin'd</br>Where a poore cottage was to him assign'd;</br>There he a sory lively-hood must make,</br>By angling Froggs out of a stinking Lake.</br>The writer also of Diurnalls was</br>Condemned to a farre remoter place,</br>For he was banish'd to an uncouth land,</br>Where only Apes inhabit and command:</br>And there he was enjoyn'd to instruct these,</br>In Musicke, and in divers languages;</br>Yet had he no more languages then tongues,</br>No other musicke then the Cuckoos songs.</br>But he who did the Occurrances compile,</br>Was nor confin'd, nor forc'd to chang his soyle,</br>But by Apollo's mercy sentenc'd was,</br>To serve with paper all the Cloaca's,</br>That did unto Parnassus appertaine,</br>And if hereafter any should complaine,</br>He wanted this for necessary use,</br>Then without bayle and maineprise, or excuse,</br>He must be carri'd to that prison sad,</br>Bocardo call'd, whence no releasments had.", "The writer of the True Accounts then heares</br>His grevious censure, with unwilling eares:</br>He was condem'd unto the Stygian Galley,</br>Where he was forc'd upon a wooden talley</br>To keep a true account of all those Ghosts</br>That daily ferry'd to the further Coasts:</br>And for his hire, each night receive hee must</br>Three fillips on the nose, with a browne crust</br>Of mouldy bread:  and hee for seven yeares
