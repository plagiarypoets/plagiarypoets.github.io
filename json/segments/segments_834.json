["The Sun withdraws his forceful ray,</br>In vapoury clouds he veils his head,</br>And Winter half obscuring day</br>Arises from his icy bed:</br>Impetuous whirlwinds form his train,</br>Thick clouds and darkness round him lour;</br>He drives his blasts o'er every plain,</br>And Nature shrinks aghast, and owns his conquering pow'r.", "The boisterous winds, with ceaseless roar,</br>Bid the rough surges proudly rise,</br>Impetuous beat the ravag'd shore,</br>And strive t' engage the frowning skies.</br>In snow-built car, with solemn pace,</br>Pale Frost glides o'er the joyless plains;</br>He bids the raging waters cease,</br>And binds the yielding waves with adamantine chains.", "The trees resign their verdant hue,</br>And tremble at the the whirlwind's sound;</br>The rose, bespangled o'er with dew,</br>No longer sheds its fragrance round:</br>All beauty fades, and Winter dire,</br>Tremendous holds imperial sway;</br>The storms proclaim their powerful Sire,</br>And bellowing round his throne, with horrors blast the day.", "If chance the breezes cease to blow,</br>Deep in their rocky caverns bound,</br>The clouds emit the treasur'd snow,</br>And brightness covers all the ground,</br>\"Broad o'er the south,\" the Sun appears,</br>And faintly points his noon-tide rays,</br>A silvery brow the mountain bears,</br>Nor sheds his hoary locks, nor feels th' enfeebled blaze.", "When unadorn'd the pallid morn,</br>Faint opening shews the leafless grove,</br>Oft let me tread the whiten'd lawn,</br>Or thro' the frozen valley rove:</br>On thee, great Nature, let me gaze,</br>Retir'd in thy sequester'd bowers,</br>Till Sol resumes his bright'ning blaze,</br>And Spring, with dewy hand, awakes the vernal flowers.</br>"]
