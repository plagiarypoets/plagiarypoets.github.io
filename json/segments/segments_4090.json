["To ease my fond heart of it's pain,</br>To soften the pangs I endure,</br>I wander'd alone o'er the plain,</br>And in solitude sought out a cure;", "But ah!  'twas in vain, for each bough,</br>Whose leaves gently wav'd with the wind,</br>Repeated thy truth and thy vow,</br>And whisper'd my Damon was kind.", "But say, would he leave me to mourn?</br>In secret to heave the fond sigh,</br>And would he not wish to return</br>To chase these sad tears from mine eye.", "I flew to the casket of love,</br>And each dear memorial caress'd,</br>In vain to accuse him I strove,</br>Too deep was his image impress'd.", "Each word was in rapturous strain,</br>Dictated by honour and truth;</br>And shall I ere dare to complain,</br>Till deceived by the generous youth.", "But, by all the fond moments of bliss</br>Which oft with Eliza thou'st shar'd,</br>By the last dear rapturous kiss,</br>O let me that moment be spar'd.", "When anguish shall tear my fond heart,</br>My eyes speak the language of love,</br>For ah!  in that moment to part,</br>Too much for Eliza 'twill prove.", "Nor would she ere wrong that dear breast,</br>On which she so often reclined,</br>When Damon has fondly carest,</br>And ne'er at his fortune repin'd.</br>"]
