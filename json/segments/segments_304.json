state,</br>The Nimphes and Muses rearing,</br>Which they to Phoebus dedicate,</br>Elizium ever cheering:</br>These Muses, and those Nimphes contend</br>This Phane to Phoebus offring,</br>Which side the other should transcend,</br>These praise, those prizes proffering,</br>And at this long appointed day,</br>Each one their largesse bringing,</br>Those nine faire Sisters led the way</br>Thus to Apollo singing.", "The MUSES.</br>Thou youthfull God that guid'st the howres,</br>The Muses thus implore thee,</br>By all those Names, due to thy powers,</br>By which we still adore thee.</br>Sol, Tytan, Delius, Cynthius, styles,</br>Much reverence that have wonne thee,</br>Deriv'd from Mountaines as from Iles</br>Where worship first was done thee.</br>Rich Delos brought thee forth divine,</br>Thy Mother thither driven,</br>At Delphos thy most sacred shrine,</br>Thy Oracles were given.</br>In thy swift course from East to West,</br>They minutes misse to finde thee,</br>That bear'st the morning on thy breast,</br>And leav'st the night behinde thee.</br>Up to Olimpus top so steepe,</br>Thy startling Coursers currying;</br>Thence downe to Neptunes vasty deepe,</br>Thy flaming Charriot hurrying.</br>Eos, Ethon, Phlegon, Pirois, proud,</br>Their lightning Maynes advancing:</br>Breathing forth fire on every cloud</br>Upon their Journey prancing.</br>Whose sparkling hoofes, with gold for speed</br>Are shod, to scape all dangers,</br>Where they upon Ambrosia feed,</br>In their celestiall Mangers.</br>Bright Colatina, that of hils</br>Is Goddesse, and hath keeping</br>Her Nimphes, the cleere Oreades wils</br>T' attend thee from thy sleeping.</br>Great Demogorgon feeles thy might,</br>His Mynes about him heating:</br>Who through his bosome dart'st thy light,</br>Within the Center sweating.</br>If thou but touch thy golden Lyre,</br>Thou Minos mov'st to heare thee:</br>The Rockes feele in themselves afire,</br>And rise up to come neere thee.</br>'Tis thou that Physicke didst devise</br>Hearbs by their natures calling:</br>Of which some opening at thy Rise,</br>And closing at thy falling.</br>Fayre Hyacinth thy most lov'd

cheerfull Ruby then, much lov'd,</br>That doth revive the spirit,</br>Whose kinde to large extensure growne</br>The colour so enflamed,</br>Is that admired mighty stone</br>The Carbunckle that's named,</br>Which from it such a flaming light</br>And radiency ejecteth,</br>That in the very dark'st of night</br>The eye to it directeth.</br>The yellow Jacynth, strengthning Sense,</br>Of which who hath the keeping,</br>No Thunder hurts nor Pestilence,</br>And much provoketh sleeping:</br>The Chrisolite, that doth resist</br>Thirst, proved, never failing,</br>The purple colored

light,</br>So nam'd, with her still ranging,</br>Which as she wanes or waxeth bright</br>Its colours so are changing.</br>With Opalls, more then any one,</br>We'll deck thine Altar fuller,</br>For

stopping:</br>With th' Agot, very oft that is</br>Cut strangely in the Quarry,</br>As Nature ment to show in this,</br>How she her selfe can varry:</br>With worlds of Gems from Mines and
