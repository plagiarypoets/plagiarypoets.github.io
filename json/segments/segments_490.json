["DAMON.  THIRSIS.", "DAMON.</br>For shame, my Thirsis!  raise thy drooping head;</br>Say!  why does grief thy pensive face o'erspread?</br>Let's think how we shall throw our time away,</br>And how consume the slowly-wasting day.</br>There was a time when on your tuneful reed,</br>Sweet pleasing strains of pow'rful love you play'd;</br>When hills and vales proclaim'd th' enchanting sound,</br>And ev'ry Shepherdess confess'd a wound.</br>Where then are these engaging raptures fled?</br>Lost are their charms, and all their influence dead.", "THIRSIS.</br>Ah, dearest friend, I've pip'd with pain too long,</br>And earn'd no good, or profit by my song:</br>Rewards for learned arts are now no more,</br>My jaded muse long since has spent her store,</br>Yet, like the grashopper, she sings, tho' poor.</br>But why should I disturb my mind's repose,</br>And jingling strains of fetter'd sense compose?</br>Why prostitute my honest muse for praise,</br>And youth's vain fancies and their passions please?</br>What profit thence to Thirsis can arise?</br>Mine is the labour, others reap the prize.", "DAMON.</br>But praise, dear Thirsis!  is a pleasing pain,</br>The weighty glory far exceeds the gain:</br>O!  what a pleasure 'tis, by rules of art,</br>To please, engage, and int'rest ev'ry heart;</br>To form the tender minds of pliant youth,</br>And teach the paths of virtue, and of truth.</br>Whenever thou begin'st the tuneful song,</br>The rural nymphs and swains around thee throng,</br>Flocks cease to graze, the stormy winds to blow,</br>Trees bend their list'ning heads, and streams forget to flow.", "THIRSIS.</br>So boys admire the gaudy peacock's train</br>Of Argus' eyes, magnificently vain;</br>But still, nor beauteous plumes, nor Argus' eyes,</br>Procure the pageant, grains of larger size.</br>True, Damon!  praise promotes the poet's art,</br>Strings ev'ry nerve, and animates the heart;</br>Yet praise, like smoke, diffuses in the sky,</br>Words are but air, their accents break and die.", "DAMON.</br>Raise then thy voice!  discard the vulgar clown!</br>And force thy way to honour and renown:</br>Go, write of warlike Mars and bloody fields!</br>The theme a larger scope for action yields:</br>There may the youth display her infant wing,</br>Of George's reign, and crush'd rebellion sing:</br>There stretch thy lab'ring flight from east to west;</br>So shall the bard and patriot stand confest.</br>Then Thirsis' fame shall mount the starry skie,</br>And such heroic actions never die.", "THIRSIS.</br>True, Friend!  I've heard how Virgil left his reed,</br>Whereon he taught his tender flocks to feed;</br>When good Maecenas patroniz'd the bard,</br>And gave to real worth its due reward:</br>Then sung the poet in a nobler strain,</br>The fate of Troy, and Troy's great monarch slain.</br>But ah!  Maecenas now in dust is laid,</br>And great Augustus long ago is dead;</br>Encouragement, support of ev'ry art,</br>No longer now inspires the poet's heart:</br>Bards!  boast no more your energy divine,</br>Nor the long glories of your antient line;</br>Well may we fear the charms of verse are fled,</br>Since patrons, and our best of bards are dead.", "DAMON.</br>Unhappy poesy, of birth divine!</br>Are these the products of thy sacred shrine?</br>Are now the laurels without honour worn,</br>And all thy sons become the gen'ral scorn?</br>Then make thee wings of thy aspiring fame,</br>And fly to heav'n indignant whence you came.", "THIRSIS.</br>Ah friend!  Parnassus is unfruitful ground,</br>Our greatest hopes with no rewards are crown'd.</br>Farewell, ye muses!  henceforth I intend</br>To leave your bow'rs, and seek some better friend;</br>If any love me, and intend to give,</br>I wish to taste their bounty while I live;</br>For what care I, when fate my thread has spun,</br>Tho' brakes and thorns my sepulchre o'er-run,</br>Or that posterity shou'd read my fame,</br>While here I starve to gain an empty name.", "DAMON.</br>Well hast thou sung, my greatest thanks are due,</br>Just are thy words, and thy complaint is true;</br>But see!  Sol hastens down the western skies,</br>Nocturnal dews, and chilly damps arise,</br>'Tis time our flocks were pent within the fold,</br>And lambkins shelter'd from the piercing cold.</br>"]
