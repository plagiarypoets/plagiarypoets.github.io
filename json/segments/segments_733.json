["When lonely Night composed the drowsy Mind,</br>And hush'd the Bosom of the weary Hind,</br>Pleas'd with plain Nature, and with simple Life,</br>I read the scenes of Shore's deluded wife,</br>Till my faint spirits sought the silent bed,</br>And on its Pillow drop'd my aking Head;</br>Then Fancy, ever to her Mira kind,</br>Prepar'd her Phantoms for the roving Mind.", "Behold a Fabrick rising from the Ground,</br>To the soft Timbrel and the Cittern's Sound:</br>Corinthian Pillars the vast Building hold,</br>Of polish'd silver, and Peruvian Gold;</br>In four broad Arches spread the shining Doors,</br>The blazing Roofs enlighten all the Floors:</br>Beneath a sparkling Canopy, that shone</br>With Persian Jewels, like a Morning Sun,</br>Wrap'd in a Robe of purest Tyrian Dye,</br>Cytherea's Image met the ravish'd Eye,</br>Whose glowing Features wou'd in Paint beguile:</br>So well the Artist drew her mimick Smile.</br>Her shining Eyes confess'd a sprightly Joy,</br>Upon her Knees reclin'd her wanton Boy;</br>On the bright Walls around her, and above,</br>Were drawn the Statutes and the Arts of Love:</br>These taught the silent Language of the Eye,</br>The broken Whisper, and amusing Lye;</br>The careless Glance peculiar to the Fair,</br>And Vows for Lovers, that dissolve in Air;</br>The graceful Anger, and the rolling Eyes;</br>The practis'd Blush, and counterfeit Surprise,</br>The Language proper for pretending Swains;</br>And fine Description for imagin'd Pains;</br>The friendly Caution, and designing Ease,</br>And all the Arts that ruin while they please.", "Now entred, follow'd by a splendid Train,</br>A blooming Damsel and a wealthy Swain;</br>The gaudy Youth in shining Robes array'd,</br>Behind him follow'd the unthinking Maid:</br>Youth in her Cheek like op'ning Roses sprung,</br>Her careless Tresses on her Shoulders hung.</br>Her Smiles were chearful as enliv'ning May;</br>Her Dress was careless, and her Eyes were gay;</br>Then to soft Voices and melodious Sound</br>The Board was spread, the sparkling Glasses crown'd;</br>The sprightly Virgin in a Moment shines</br>In the gay Entrails of the eastern Mines;</br>Then Pride comes in with Patches for the Fair,</br>And spicy Odours for her curling Hair;</br>Rude Riot, in a crimson Vest array'd,</br>With smooth-faced Flatt'ry like a Chamber-maid:</br>Soft Pomp and Pleasure at her Elbow stand,</br>And Folly shakes the Rattles in her Hand.", "But now her feeble Structure seem'd to shake;</br>Its Basis trembled, and its Pillars quake;</br>Then rush'd Suspicion through the lofty Gate,</br>With heart-sick Loathing, led by ghastly Hate;</br>And foaming Rage, to close the horrid Band,</br>With a drawn Poniard in her shaking Hand.</br>Now like an Earthquake shook the reeling Frame,</br>The Lamps extinguish in a purple Flame;</br>One universal Groan was heard, and then</br>The cries of Women, and the Voice of Men:</br>Some roar out Vengeance, some for Mercy call,</br>And Shrieks and Tumult fill the dreadful Hall;", "At length the Spectres vanish'd from my Sight;</br>Again the Lamps resum'd a feeble Light,</br>But chang'd the Place:  no Splendor there was shown,</br>But gloomy Walls that Mirth had never known;</br>For the gay Dome where Pleasure us'd to dwell,</br>Appear'd an Abbey, and a doleful Cell;</br>And here the sad, the ruin'd Nymph was found,</br>Her Robe disorder'd and her Locks unbound;</br>While from her Eyes the pearly Drops of Woe</br>Wash'd her pale Cheek, where Roses us'd to blow:</br>Her blue and trembling Lips prepar'd to breathe</br>The Sighs that made her swelling Bosom heave;</br>Thus, stupid with her Grief she sat and prest</br>Her lily Hands across her pensive Breast;</br>A Group of ghastly Phantoms stood behind,</br>Whose Task it is to rack the guilty Mind;</br>Wide-mouth'd Reproach with Visage rude and thin.</br>And hissing Scandal, made a hideous Din;</br>Remorse, that darted from her deadly Wings,</br>Invenom'd Arrows and a thousand Stings:</br>Then with pale Cheeks, and with a ghastly Stare,</br>Peep'd o'er her Shoulder hollow-eyed Despair;</br>Whose Hand extended bore a bleeding Heart,</br>And Death behind her shook his threatening Dart:</br>These Forms with Horror fill'd my aching Breast,</br>And from my Eye-lids drove the Balm of Rest:</br>I woke and found old Night her Course had run,</br>And left her Empire to the rising Sun.</br>"]
