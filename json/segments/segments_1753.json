["Hark, how the merry bells ring jocund round,</br>And now they die upon the veering breeze;</br>Anon they thunder loud,</br>Full on the musing ear.", "Wafted in varying cadence, by the shore</br>Of the still twinkling river, they bespeak</br>A day of jubilee,</br>An ancient holiday.", "And lo!  the rural revels are begun,</br>And gaily echoing to the laughing sky;</br>On the smooth-shaven green,</br>Resounds the voice of mirth.", "Alas!  regardless of the tongue of fate,</br>That tells them 'tis but as an hour since they,</br>Who now are in their graves,</br>Kept up the Whitsun dance.", "And that another hour and they must fall,</br>Like those who went before, and sleep as still</br>Beneath the silent sod,</br>A cold and cheerless sleep.", "Yet why should thoughts like these intrude to scare</br>The vagrant Happiness, when she will deign</br>To smile upon us here,</br>A transient visitor?", "Mortals!  be gladsome while ye have the power,</br>And laugh and seize the glittering lapse of joy;</br>In time the bell will toll</br>That warns ye to your graves.", "I to the woodland solitude will bend</br>My lonesome way &mdash; where mirth's obstreperous shout</br>Shall not intrude to break</br>The meditative hour.", "There will I ponder on the state of man,</br>Joyless and sad of heart, and consecrate</br>This day of jubilee</br>To sad reflection's shrine;", "And I will cast my fond eye far beyond</br>This world of care, to where the steeple loud</br>Shall rock above the sod,</br>Where I shall sleep in peace.</br>"]
