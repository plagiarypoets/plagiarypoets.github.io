["By Hudson's stream I stand:  ah!  not inspir'd</br>As when in youth my yielding spirit could take</br>The stamp of nature's beauty, and was fir'd</br>By the warm impress.  Oh!  when sorrows make</br>Man's heart the home of thoughts that ne'er forsake</br>The self-made wretched, rove his eyes in vain</br>O'er nature's magic page!  she cannot break,</br>E'en with her spells of power, the two-fold chain</br>That links the soul to wo, the wasted frame to pain.", "Let others view thee, Hudson, in this hour,</br>That poets love, the last of day's decline,</br>Urging thy water-steeds in beauty and power</br>Beneath the rude Matawan's length'ning line;</br>I cannot bow in peace at nature's shrine,</br>Nor feel, e'en in this speaking solitude,</br>Thy loveliness around my bosom twine;&mdash;</br>Suit not thy charms a heart by grief subdu'd,&mdash;</br>By woes that cannot weep, and vain regrets pursu'd.", "Yet parting day smiles sweetly on thy cheek,</br>Fair Hudson, and his glowing fingers throw</br>A lovely mantle o'er thee; and in meek</br>And quiet beauty on thy burnish'd brow</br>Glitter the gems of heav'n; thy tresses flow</br>In liquid amber. &mdash; Streaming to the eye,</br>Like hosts of fire, thy guardian mountains glow,</br>Around the sun's fast-falling throne on high,</br>Rearing their crested helms, in cloudy panoply.", "They cannot shield the glories that must fade</br>In night's oblivion!  I will look no more</br>Upon thy waters &mdash; do they not upbraid</br>My spirit with their peace?  e'en since I bore</br>The name of man, and through th' expanding door</br>Of the bright future chased those shapes of air,</br>That lured to hopes they left me to deplore;</br>No balm doth Nature bring me; &mdash; when I bare</br>My bosom's wounds, she smiles, and mocks the anguish there!</br>"]
