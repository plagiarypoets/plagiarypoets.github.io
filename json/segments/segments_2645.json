["Ye shepherds, who yet are a stranger to love,</br>And think him a boy fond of joking,</br>Believe me, if ever his nature you prove,</br>You'll find him an urchin provoking.</br>Though yet with his smiles you have not been deceiv'd,</br>Take counsel from me and be wary,</br>Like you, his sad tricks, I had never believ'd,</br>Had I not been instructed by Mary.", "I did not much like my own peace to destroy,</br>And laugh'd when I saw lovers languish;</br>I wish'd all the pleasure of love to enjoy,</br>But resolv'd to have none of the anguish.</br>Thus I kiss'd the sweet lips of each nymph of the plain,</br>Like a butterfly, fickle and airy;</br>Thus I scoff'd and I sneer'd at each languishing swain,</br>But alas!  I had not then seen Mary.", "She was pure as the rose-bud, and scarcely fifteen,</br>When she came to our village a stranger,</br>I saw, and admir'd her angelical mien,</br>But never once thought of my danger,</br>All my former love-promises soon now I broke;</br>And it surely was no wild vagary,</br>Since so many fair nymphs I had courted in joke,</br>If I tried to do so with sweet Mary.", "I courted her, just as I courted the rest,</br>But ah!  with a diff'rent sensation;</br>For when her sweet lips as a lover I press'd,</br>My heart beat in strange palpitation.</br>Her praises I sang &mdash; but I thought the song true,</br>And believe she must deal with a fairy:</br>For of all the fair mortals I ever yet knew,</br>There was none so enchanting as Mary.", "I now am uneasy but when she is near,</br>And seldom am guilty of sleeping;</br>And tho' I disdain'd once the name of a tear,</br>Am constantly sighing and weeping:</br>Then, ye shepherds be wise; for to you is address'd,</br>This maxim, that never can vary,</br>To many sweet girls you may make love in jest,</br>But you must be sincere with a Mary.</br>"]
