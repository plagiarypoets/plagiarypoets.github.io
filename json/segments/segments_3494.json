["O haste, ye hovering clouds, away,</br>Ye clouds so fleecy, dim, and pale,</br>Thro' which the Moon's obstructed ray</br>Sheds this sad whiteness o'er the vale!</br>Forbear, ye bells, that languid strain!</br>The sight, the sound, are fraught with pain;</br>The words of dying friends I hear,</br>The open grave I linger near,</br>Take the last look, and drop the parting tear!", "Before my view dire phantoms rise,</br>The plagues of hapless human-kind!</br>Pale Fear, who unpursued still flies,</br>And starts, and turns, and looks behind;</br>Remorse, whose own indignant aim</br>Deforms with useless wounds her frame;</br>Despair, whose tongue no speech will deign,</br>Whose ghastly brow looks dark disdain,</br>And bends from steep rocks o'er the foaming main.", "And Rage, whose bosom inly burns,</br>While Reason's call he scorns to hear;</br>And Jealousy, who ruthless turns</br>From suppliant Beauty's prayer and tear;</br>Revenge, whose thoughts tumultuous roll</br>To seek the poniard or the bowl;</br>And Phrensy, wildly passing by,</br>With her chain'd arm and starting eye,</br>And voice that with loud curses rends the sky!", "Ambition, here, to heights of power</br>His course with daring step pursues,</br>Tho' Danger's frown against him lour,</br>Tho' Guilt his path with blood bestrews;</br>There Avarice grasps his useless store,</br>Tho' Misery's plaints his aid implore,</br>Tho' he, her ruin'd cottage nigh,</br>Beholds her famish'd infants lie,</br>And hears their faint, their last expiring cry!", "Ye dreadful band!  O spare, O spare!</br>Alas, your ear no prayers persuade!</br>But, ah!  if Man your reign must bear,</br>Sure Man had better ne'er been made!</br>Say, will Religion clear this gloom,</br>And point to bliss beyond the tomb?</br>Yes, haply for her chosen train;</br>The rest, they say, severe decrees ordain</br>To realms of endless night, and everlasting pain!</br>"]
