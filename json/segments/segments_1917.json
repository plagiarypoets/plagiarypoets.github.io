["What though the Italian pencil wrought not here,</br>Nor such fine skill as did the meed bestow</br>On Marathonian valour, yet the tear</br>Springs forth in presence of this gaudy show,</br>While narrow cares their limits overflow.</br>Thrice happy, burghers, peasants, warriors old,</br>Infants in arms, and ye, that as ye go</br>Homeward or schoolward, ape what ye behold;</br>Heroes before your time, in frolic fancy bold!", "And when that calm Spectatress from on high</br>Looks down &mdash; the bright and solitary Moon,</br>Who never gazes but to beautify;</br>And snow-fed torrents, which the blaze of noon</br>Roused into fury, murmur a soft tune</br>That fosters peace, and gentleness recalls;</br>Then might the passing Monk receive a boon</br>Of saintly pleasure from these pictured walls,</br>While, on the warlike groups, the mellowing lustre falls.", "How blest the souls who when their trials come</br>Yield not to terror or despondency,</br>But face like that sweet Boy their mortal doom,</br>Whose head the ruddy apple tops, while he</br>Expectant stands beneath the linden tree:</br>He quakes not like the timid forest game,</br>But smiles &mdash; the hesitating shaft to free;</br>Assured that Heaven in justice will proclaim,</br>And to his Father give its own unerring aim.</br>"]
