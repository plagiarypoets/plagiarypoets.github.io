["Genius of Milton, wake!</br>In all thy native majesty appear,</br>Sublime, concise, and clear,</br>As when thy strains, heav'ns battlements did shake</br>Or, as when o'er the urn</br>Of Lycidas, thou pour'dst the plaintive song,</br>In numbers sweet and strong:</br>When elegy gave all her woes away,</br>In each sad sighing lay,</br>And taught the willows, and the waves to mourn.", "Or, come like Mirth, with airy train,</br>Lightly tripping o'er the plain;</br>Bid the little elves advance,</br>And playful form the mystic dance.</br>Let the sprightly loves be seen</br>Frolicking, on ev'ry green,</br>And Pan, his oaten reed display,</br>To pipe the shepherd's holiday.</br>Or else, in solemn shape arise,</br>With pensive brow, and fixed eyes;</br>Where rivers o'er their rough rocks roll,</br>And melancholy  curfews toll.", "O, quickly come, and bring with thee,</br>The genuine soul of Harmony!</br>Then pleas'd I'll wander thro' the wood,</br>Or near the margin of the flood,</br>Frequent the still embow'red shades,</br>Or glide along enamell'd glades:</br>Where oft the twitt'ring martens skim,</br>The silent river's crystal brim:</br>And oft the plover whistles shrill</br>To the gurgling of the rill,</br>And the busy humming bee,</br>Hives within some hollow tree.</br>And the healthy honest swain,</br>Cultivates the stubborn plain;</br>Or resting from his daily toil,</br>Marks the diff'rence of the soil.", "But chief, when Cynthia shining bright,</br>Gives sportive Fancy full delight,</br>Let me all solitary rove,</br>Within the covert of the grove,</br>There Lock shou'd teach my thoughts to rise;</br>Or Newton lead me to his skies;</br>Or Seneca, with moral page,</br>Instruct my youth, inform my age;</br>Or Tully, rouse my languid soul,</br>While oratorical thunders roll;</br>Or with his pathos fill the eye;</br>Or softly sooth the rising sigh;</br>Or there, beneath some ancient tree,</br>I'd sit and muse on liberty.</br>Bid suns roll back a thousand years,</br>'Till virtuous Alfred's age appears;</br>When Freedom first began to dawn,</br>And shepherds safe possess'd the lawn,</br>And pip'd and danc'd upon the plain,</br>In honour of an Alfred's reign.</br>Then swiftly pass succeeding days,</br>(No fool or tyrant spots my lays,)</br>But stop, when great Eliza rules,</br>That scourge of Tyrants  and of Fools:</br>When Wisdom held and blest this isle,</br>While Freedom beam'd beneath her smile;</br>Again, I'd bound beyond the reign</br>Of Princes dupes to France or Spain,</br>'Till William lifts his laurel'd head,</br>Of France the foe, of Spain the dread,</br>When Temples rose to Liberty,</br>And blithsome Britons, full of glee,</br>Sung Albion happy, Albion free.", "But, Genius should thy touch inspire,</br>My glowing mind with martial fire,</br>To arms, to arms, the muse should cry</br>With flushing cheek, and sparkling eye;</br>To arms, should ev'ry Briton sound,</br>And dye with blood the dusty ground,</br>Bellona mount her brazen car,</br>And kindle all the rage of war.</br>And now, perhaps, thy fury o'er,</br>The bold notes swell with death no more:</br>The strings are struck, but struck in vain,</br>'Tis all a soft and silken strain;</br>The loves, and graces, now demand</br>The melting music of thy hand:</br>Beauty, all her pow'r will prove,&mdash;</br>The muse submits, and all is love.</br>While sideling glances, stifled sighs,</br>Heaving breasts, and languid eyes,</br>Murm'ring whispers, wanton wishes,</br>Am'rous smiles, and eager kisses,</br>And various other charms, conspire</br>To fan the flame of gay desire,</br>So loose and airy, soft and free,</br>&mdash;Love expires in ecstasie!</br>"]
