["Adieu to sweet &mdash;, adieu!</br>The village is look'd for in vain,</br>The woodland has shut it from view;</br>I ne'er shall behold it again.</br>Yet with the dear circle I've left,</br>Methinks I for ever could stay,</br>And feel as of something bereft,</br>So soon to be whirled away.", "I've bade the fair Anna farewell,</br>And surely my eyes must have said,</br>If they the heart's feelings can tell,</br>How much I admired the maid.</br>She brought a lov'd sister to mind,</br>When sporting the graces of youth;</br>Like her she seem'd gentle and kind,</br>Like her she look'd candour and truth.", "Maria, so lately unknown,</br>Too swells the soft sigh at my heart,</br>Her mind so resembled my own,</br>I felt it like sorrow to part;</br>Her countenance open as day,</br>Her soft and intelligent eye,</br>Seem'd sweetly, I fancied, to say,</br>A spirit congenial am I.", "And Harriot, whose elegant mien</br>Led captive the eye as she mov'd,</br>A place in my heart will retain,</br>She's found out the way to be lov'd.</br>Ah, when will fate make me amends!</br>Ah, when for these tortures atone?</br>I'm smil'd on a moment by friends,</br>The next, the sweet vision has flown!", "And these are the gambols she plays,</br>Each day it appears at her will,</br>A sceptre of iron she sways,</br>Not a change but what's teeming with ill.</br>The friends of my youth were convey'd</br>Far distant, or wrapt in the tomb;</br>I've wander'd thro' life in the shade,</br>I'm mantled in Destiny's gloom.", "But why these repinings of mind?</br>A Providence rules over all;</br>Then give me the portion assign'd,</br>Or sweetness, or wormwood and gall,</br>I'll fancy it all for the best,</br>For all it decrees must be right,</br>Nor murmur at Heaven's behest,</br>Though ever encircled by night.", "And now, courteous &mdash;, adieu;</br>The claim on politeness is paid,</br>So leave us our way to pursue,</br>And return to your favourite maid.</br>Return, see the cloud ascends high,</br>And threatens a torrent of rain,</br>Loud thunders roll over the sky,</br>Sharp lightning glares over the plain:", "Return, for the wan of your cheek,</br>Whence fevers have banish'd the rose,</br>Tho' youthful, shows nature is weak,</br>The fluid of life languid flows.</br>But fear not for us, tho' the hour</br>The mantle of evening puts on;</br>We'll trust in the heavenly Power</br>To guard, as it ever has done.", "Though the bosom is fill'd with dismay,</br>For terror I feel, I must own,</br>It shall not bewilder our way,</br>I've learned how to journey alone.</br>The owl and the whip-poor-will's cry</br>Casts somehow a gloom o'er the heart,</br>Tho' the cloud that so mantled the sky</br>Appears to be breaking apart.", "Return, courteous youth, and convey</br>To friends all that's tender and kind,</br>But language can never pourtray</br>The feeling imprest on my mind.</br>May I meet the fair circle of love,</br>United as now they appear,</br>In regions, bright regions above,</br>When ended our pilgrimage here.</br>"]
