["Hence!  false, designing cheat, from garret vile,</br>Or murky cellar sprung!  thy spurious birth</br>And mix'd embrace thy pallid hue proclaims.</br>Think'st thou 'mongst those of pure and gen'rous stamp</br>To pass unknown, and by dissembling face</br>And mimic form to gull me credulous?</br>I mark'd thee 'midst thy betters, and with eye</br>Distinguishing arrested thy deceit;</br>Dar'st thou confront the envied worth thou ap'st</br>Confess'd to open day?  Come forth to view;</br>Naught will avail thy name and face assum'd,</br>And regal head with George's laurel bound:</br>Thy telltale paleness speaks thee counterfeit.</br>Lives there a beggar wretch with hunger prest</br>Would take thee offer'd?  thou art known so well</br>The honest tradesman will not sell thee wares.</br>The gawky clown too late, alas!  has found</br>He took a sharper, when he harbour'd you.</br>I've got thee safe; no more expect to thrive</br>By cheating innocence; in durance firm</br>I'll fix thee, to deter thy bastard race.</br>Thus many a harvest, by deceit and fraud,</br>The cunning juggler thrives; till by success</br>He grows less cautious, nor to weedling maids</br>By promis'd sweethearts, he his art confines:</br>But in ill fated hour attempts to trick</br>More knowing townsmen; they, averse to frauds,</br>Or take his greasy galligaskins down,</br>And birchen smart inflict; or shut in cage,</br>To curse his fortune, and atone his crimes.</br>"]
