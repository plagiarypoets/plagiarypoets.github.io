["Ye lovers of Science lament,</br>No longer must Coughron impart,</br>What deep in rich nature lies pent,</br>E'en truths of mysterious art.", "A worthy acquaintance to all,</br>His passions were gen'rous and free;</br>Renowned, and great in his fall,</br>Nor saw more than years twenty-three.", "On banks of meandering Tweed</br>The youth first would nature define;</br>But (urg'd by Minerva) agreed</br>To rifle her stores on the Tyne.", "Each artist his aid wou'd implore,</br>Affirming him prince of the train;</br>Who could with such majesty soar,</br>As witness his CURVE on the plane.", "His Phillis was heard in the groves,</br>Crying, \"He that could please is no more;\"</br>Thro' fields of Elysium he roves,</br>The king of all kings to adore!", "His judgment, his genius how great;</br>His reasoning faculty strong:</br>A lawyer, an artist compleat,</br>And worthy, thrice worthy my song.", "His praise future ages will ring,</br>Yea myriads of Coughron will tell;</br>In strains undulating they'll sing,</br>How wreathed with laurels he fell.</br>"]
