["But you tell me that to shine as a wit, is a jest,</br>That one grain of low cunning's worth a tun of the rest</br>To succeed in the world, and that prudence and sense,</br>Secure a man fame, and friendship and pence;</br>Whilst ill-fated genius you're ready to swear,</br>Builds chimaeras and castles aloft in the air:</br>And I'm tempted to think prudence better by half,</br>Than wit, and a knack at making folks laugh.</br>Great men use a bard, as rakes use a whore,</br>When their end is obtain'd, they'll see her no more:</br>Thus to poets like me, some kind modern patron,</br>Gives his beef and his port for joking and flatt'ring;</br>But when we retire, he feels no concern,</br>If we snore on a bulk, or sleep in a barn.</br>Few are able or willing, like Dyson I fear,</br>To allow a poor author three hundred a year:</br>Or few will be found, tho' I'm loth to observe it,</br>Very few, who like Akenside, richly deserve it.</br>Come then, common sense, be a friend to an elf,</br>Who alas is a foe to no man but himself:</br>When the fever of gaming possesses his soul,</br>And love irresistible proffers the bowl,</br>When fashion and taste whisper both in his ear,</br>To live like a man with three thousand a year,</br>Tho' his elegant ardors and wishes to curse,</br>He has scarce ever more than ten pounds in his purse;</br>When Bacchus and Venus, thy poet invite,</br>Do thou jog his elbow to wish them good night:</br>When mahametan White is soaring due East,</br>On the wings of poor Badcock who dy'd in the West;</br>(Tho' Gabriel neglecting his Bath pater-noster,</br>Swears that White is himself an Arabian impostor;)</br>When an ideot or rank is pretending to chatter,</br>Of learning and taste, yet knows nought of the matter;</br>When Cumberland fancies the drama his glory,</br>And stuffs his observers with old Grecian story;</br>When arm'd at all points great Bellendine Parr,</br>'Gainst Curtis's zeal wages classical war,</br>Of disputes long forgot, will be sifting the refuse,</br>And republish old pamphlets, for the sake of a preface,</br>Excell all your Warburtons, Jortins and Hurds,</br>In sonorous expression, and terrible words:</br>Teach me then my new guide more precious than ruby</br>To nod, smile, and bow, on each drivelling booby,</br>Let the roughness of satire then smoothly be fill'd,</br>And preferment shall call me her favorite child.</br>Common sense wou'd teach Edmund when scolding the house,</br>Not to sink from sublime, to the skip of a louse;</br>Was it sense that made Gibbon obscenities quote?</br>And put them in Latin by way of a note.</br>Did it make him praise Julian who threw out such shabby taunts,</br>And boast of his beard with many inhabitants?</br>Did it teach our historian to collect from his stores,</br>That Constantine rais'd a revenue on whores?</br>And declare with a grave philosophical meekness,</br>Seduction and rape, and amiable weakness?</br>But adieu to these tribes, from joke I'll be parting,</br>Since you frown at satirical hints, my dear Warton,</br>And advise me to study, in White, Blair, and Jortin,</br>And instead of abusing great men in my letters,</br>Like you get preferment by flatt'ring my betters:</br>Or the cudgels take up against Gibbon unchristian,</br>Under mild Horseley's banners, that learned Philistian,</br>Who arrows polemic so keenly doth try a</br>'Gainst the grand innovator un-Priestly Goliah.</br>I've try'd all these arts 'till invention's extinguish'd,</br>Call'd Moor independent, and North a great linguist,</br>Said their brethren the bishops were one great example,</br>Of piety, learning, and charity ample;</br>I have rail'd against schism, prais'd Grenville for wit,</br>I have bullied with Thurlow, preach'd morals with Pitt;</br>I've attack'd a French writer, who, neglecting his beads,</br>Observes (while he scatters heretical seeds)</br>Bishops shorten commandments, but lengthen their creeds.</br>All this I have done, and what's my reward?</br>To preach fast a-sleep half Faringdon ward,</br>To each once a week the Church-warden's mutton,</br>Bear the rascal's coarse jokes, and flatter a glutton;</br>Hear his wife and his daughter retail city wit,</br>While Miss is so \"narvous,\" she can't eat a bit;</br>Tho' I know all the time, spite of mincing and munching,</br>She has eat fowl and ham by the pound for a luncheon:</br>Tempted strong by her cash to take for a wife,</br>What's sure to torment me the rest of my life:</br>Thus for sad nasty mixtures, to doctors we send,</br>Tho' the stomach revolts, yet our habits they mend.</br>Thus to starve as a curate, I my life must devote,</br>Or marry a woman who's just like a goat:</br>Whose beard on her chin grows so shockingly high,</br>That she wants a sharp razor much oft'ner than I;</br>Her mother's soft whispers, as she helps me to gravy,</br>\"I really imagine our Polly wou'd have you.\"</br>I once was in love, but how the time alter,</br>Now Hymen's silk noose, looks to me like a halter;</br>Must I, once remark'd for an elegant wish,</br>From turbot and salmon, sit down to salt fish?</br>Must I, once so blest by the Manciple's daughter,</br>Who amongst Oxford bucks made such a terrible slaughter?</br>Must I, who have rifled a bosom of snow,</br>At last feed in London on liver and crow?</br>Must I, who admir'd a delicate skin,</br>Bed and board with a woman as ugly as sin?</br>A monster, a scarecrow, by night and by day,</br>To freeze all desire, fright passion away:</br>Who serves her poor face (O that cruel small pox)</br>As great auctioneers serve a vile country box;</br>E'er the day of the sale opens, ev'ry effort is try'd,</br>With whitewash and plaister, the mud-wall to hide,</br>Yet the bidders all find, tho' ply'd well with tokay,</br>The pleasure ground boggy, and the chimnies all smoky.</br>The life of a peasant far pleasanter proves,</br>Contentment and health with the woman he loves,</br>Tho' fortune denies him ragouts and rich treats,</br>Delight gives a zest to the morsel he eats,</br>He awakes undisturb'd by ennui or pain,</br>To charms which a monarch wou'd sigh for in vain;</br>The vigor of health inspirits each kiss,</br>While Cupid and Hymen both hallow the bliss.</br>Such once were my dreams, when my mind us'd to rove,</br>On the arrow of Cupid, and Venus's dove;</br>Is there not cause enough for a man to be sorry at,</br>But the subject we'll quit, now for you Mr. LAUREAT:</br>You remember I promis'd I'd take shortly the freedom,</br>To send you instructions, wou'd you deign but to read 'em.</br>I have sent them at last, but at Trinity College,</br>You are so full of antiques, and of old gothic knowledge,</br>Of knights-fees, of priests, of old books of mass,</br>Of old frescoed walls, and old painted glass;</br>Of devoting your time to black letter'd nonsense,</br>Which to read or to write has been given up long since.</br>As if it imported three half farthing candles,</br>Whether Alfred was christen'd, or his daughters wore sandals;</br>If the heel of Achilles was imperfectly dipt,</br>Or if Milton, at Oxford, is the last who was whipt;</br>Tho' Johnson was try'd, like a friend to our church,</br>To prove the republican tasted of birch;</br>Or to find by a lucky inquisitive knack,</br>That Augustus had never a shirt to his back:</br>That Zenobia's eyes were black as a sloe,</br>That she scolded Longinus when he trod on her toe;</br>That queen Cleopatra was a sweet charming singer,</br>Had a mole on her neck, and a crooked fore-finger;</br>That RICHARD the Third, whom we all so abuse,</br>Was a good sort of man as ever wore shoes.</br>On subjects like these while you're solemnly preaching,</br>I presume on your patience, and venture on teaching:</br>But least by my verse, I the theme shou'd disgrace,</br>My doggrel I'll quit, and alter my pace.", "INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LAUREAT.</br>When with your annual ode you next resort,</br>Wou'd you for once but warble truth at court;</br>By truth I mean, not base malignant rhymes,</br>That slander kings, and villify the times,</br>That injure humble merit, patient and meek,</br>And force the tear down woman's lovely cheek,</br>With coarse invective the rude page adorn,</br>And hold misfortune up to public scorn.</br>Now our lov'd king whose fate made nations groan,</br>Is firmly seated on fair reason's throne,</br>Now let thy laurel'd Muse serenely gay,</br>Pour truth's choice gifts on this auspicious day,</br>Then future times thy praises shall rehearse,</br>And hail thee more than a mere man of verse.</br>For Norman minstrelsy, and ivy'd towers,</br>Knight-errant tales, and Spenser's fairy bowers,</br>In dulcet notes, and harmony divine,</br>Let admonition point thy moral line,</br>Let these great truths, the courtier's chat o'erwhelm;</br>\"A king of parties rules but half his realm,</br>Or whig or tory let true merit be,</br>The only badge of worthiness to thee,</br>Possest of that, tho' not a single vote,</br>Cherish the stranger in a thread-bare coat.</br>'Tis not to view a fleet with sails unfurl'd,</br>Or nightly trace the planetary world,</br>'Tis not with trifling mechanism to play,</br>And waste in happy nicknacks, half the day,</br>'Tis not with servants to throw off restraint,</br>Hear Siddons read, and teach good West to paint;</br>To fast and pray, to roll th' uplifted eye,</br>Are what the veriest bigot can supply;</br>'Tis not to tempt by pageantry and glare,</br>The mobs huzza, the crowds unmeaning stare,</br>In these the bays from thee are easy won,</br>By pray'r and fast the bigot Philip shone,</br>And while his Belgic regions flow'd with blood,</br>A fawning clergy call'd him great and good.</br>In acts like these thy fame can never live,</br>For these are proofs that any man cou'd give.</br>What tho' the nations hastily complies,</br>With frequent messages, and large supplies:</br>Tho' often craving, still so odd your fate,</br>You beg of bankrupts, yet accumulate.</br>Thus some young heir whom wealthy sires have left,</br>Of no one gift but common sense bereft,</br>Thoughtless and gay expensive arts explores,</br>With glitt'ring gamblers, and Italian whores;</br>Newmarket bets, election contests dire,</br>And dissipation set his soul on fire;</br>At last reflection comes when all is spent,</br>And posts him quickly to the Continent;</br>As he departs, the steward makes his bow,</br>Of all his goods and chattels master now.</br>Your royal offspring, we admit, demand</br>Your soft solicitude and rearing hand,</br>Yet subjects are your children, who obey,</br>And claim your tenderest love as well as they:</br>What if for us you had

pity's melting eyes,</br>Devour'd with impost, taxes, and excise.</br>Feel for their woes, thy private savings give,</br>Struggling with want in misery they live,</br>Except the chosen few, in affluence proud,</br>Who fly to London's fascinating crowd,</br>Leaving the hapless villager a prey</br>To pain and hunger through the tedious day.</br>To Cam and Isis turn a searching eye,</br>On either stands a university,</br>Where old abuse supports her drowzy reign,</br>And reason cries reform, but cries in vain:</br>There raw from school the beardless fresh-man runs,</br>To dress and freedom, sing-song, wine and duns.</br>Pleasure's allurements he at first repels,</br>But the bowl mantles, and his pulse rebels;</br>Ungovern'd here, a copious store he lays,</br>Of pangs repentant for his future days.</br>Tutors and proctors all in ruin join,</br>They dare not frown, who help to drink his wine;</br>His eyes old coins instead of bibles search,</br>Hume and Voltaire prepare him

those who labour most are paid the worst,</br>The curate thin with holy drudg'ry curst,</br>Trembling, with hat in hand, he sees from far,</br>The mitred prelate in his splendid car;</br>And hateful tythes from brawny labour tear,</br>The hard-earn'd morsel of the scanty year.</br>Here a few weeks the pluralist may sport,</br>But spends his happier hours at cards and court,</br>Leaving his curate

in price of corn,</br>Do sense and learning his arch'd brow adorn?</br>He was at college every scholar's scorn:</br>But faith untainted orthodox supplies</br>The want of other christian qualities.</br>What volumes those which claim his constant looks?</br>No doubt a bible, and some godly books;</br>A small mistake, look nearer, you'll discern,</br>Blackstone, a Tract on Tythes, and

sees,</br>Who mildly came dispensing joy and ease,</br>He scarce will think a minister of peace.</br>His furious tenets charity confound,</br>While Athanasian curses echo round.</br>Martyr of vice, and ruddy with the bowl,</br>He ev'ry Lent still damns his neighbour's soul;</br>And tho' religion, heav'nly maid came down,</br>To soothe our sorrows with a heav'nly crown,</br>He turns this manna the Almighty sent,</br>To curses, tyranny, and punishment.</br>His deeds, his vain profession clearly prove,</br>Forgot that new, that best command, to love.</br>And can we wonder that from guides like these,</br>Who from religion banish christian peace,</br>The crowd misled shou'd turn their fickle eyes,</br>To superstition, rant, and mockeries?</br>These points demand thy care my royal sire,</br>Reform in these, thy people all desire,</br>Except the sleek ecclesiastic moth,</br>Who will desert thee in the day of wrath;</br>These and a servile, base, insidious tribe,</br>With
