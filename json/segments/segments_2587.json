["Old Ocean hath not brought his terrors here,</br>But the pleased eye rests on a beauteous plain,</br>Smooth as the sand, and as the heaven clear,</br>Whose rippling margin whispers in such strain,</br>That scarce the eager footsteps can refrain</br>From venturing on to where those fairy Heights appear!", "Dim, but not dark, they shadowy brightness send</br>Across the distance; then they melt in air;</br>Then, bursting from a cloud, they seem to bend</br>Nearer to France, and sterner port they bear;</br>And then the Sun's rich livery they wear,</br>As if his Viceroy's, charg'd his glories to extend.", "Are they the portals of some bless'd abode,</br>Sunk in the waters, rising to the skies?</br>Or mounds for the cherubic guard who showed</br>Their flaming weapons over Paradise?</br>Or outworks of Eternity, that rise</br>Unchang'd, though years have passed, storms howled, and currents flow'd!", "Sure Time on them hath built his royal throne,</br>Displayed his state, and fixed his Majesty;</br>From whence to view all by his hand cast down,</br>City, and realm, order, and dynasty,</br>Go floating, on the stream of ages, by</br>In fragments, soon to sink, then rest for aye unknown.", "And to his feet he hath the Tempests ta'en,</br>And kennell'd them in caves from whence they cry,</br>Until he lets them loose upon the Main,</br>Which bellows through its lone immensity,</br>As o'er its breast they in their fury fly,</br>Howling a many-voiced hymn of wild disdain!", "Loud be their roar, and tameless be their rage!</br>For there is one to whom their wrath is might;</br>Yoked to her car, they've sped, for many an age,</br>Her vengeance on its course, in glorious fight&mdash;</br>Then turn'd to crouch around her, like the Night,</br>Still ready for the Island Queen new wars to wage.</br>"]
