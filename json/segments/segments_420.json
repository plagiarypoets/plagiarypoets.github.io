[". . .  No Monarch so bless'd, or so happy as me,</br>While thus, my dear Horace, I hug it in thee:</br>Admire it in loftier Virgil, or Smile</br>When with Waggish Catullus my Cares I'd beguile.", "When with thee, Ariosto, or Tasso, I sport,</br>Or go with our Spencer to his Fairy-Court,</br>Or Cowley, or Oldham, or Davenant pursue,</br>Or spend a few Hours, neat Waller, with you.", "Here I read till I'm quite into Ecstasies carry'd,</br>As soon as the Sun peeps into my Garret;</br>There, out of the reach of ill Fate, and Disaster,</br>I sit; and the Drawer's as great as his Master.</br>"]
