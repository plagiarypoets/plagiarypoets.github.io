["Sweet visitant, who lov'st the hallow'd shrine,</br>Devoid of tremulous fear, who joy'st to flit</br>Athwart dim-colour'd lights</br>That Gothic windows shed;", "I bless thee, warbler, bless the care of Heaven,</br>That in thy tuneful breast, this instinct breath'd,</br>Here, shelter'd from the blast</br>Thou pour'st thy carols round.", "Here, hid from fowler's eye, secure thou liv'st,</br>By tabby foes unwatch'd, or wanton death.</br>Meantime, thy hapless mates</br>Or murder'd, stain chaste snows,", "Or, shivering, die amid the forest-wilds,</br>The swollen victims of keen wintry winds;</br>While sorrowing dirges, here,</br>Thou sing'st o'er many a grave.", "Sweet care of gracious Heaven!  thy future life</br>Haply the bright celestial fields may glad,</br>There thou in evergreens,</br>May'st thy soft texture weave:", "There fondly mark'd by purer eyes than mine,</br>And there, with never-dying warbles blest,</br>Thou may'st the shades enjoy</br>In unmolested bliss.</br>"]
