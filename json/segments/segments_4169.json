["On the banks of the sweet flowing Tay</br>A shepherd desponding reclin'd;</br>Poor Damon, alas!  (he did say),</br>You may die now, since Delia's unkind:</br>When I liv'd in her favour before,</br>Fair peace did my moments employ;</br>She has left me, and what have I more</br>That can give either pleasure or joy?", "Ah!  how could I think the fair maid</br>Would deign to so humble a swain,</br>When so many gay shepherds invade,</br>And follow her over the plain?</br>My flock's all the treasure I have,</br>And a small one, with others compar'd:</br>I was pleas'd with what Providence gave,</br>And its favour most thankfully shar'd.", "But since Delia deserted the vale,</br>My sheep all neglected do stray,</br>And my pipe, that enliven'd the dale,</br>I have thrown as quite useless away.</br>Ye warblers that tune the soft strain,</br>And chant it along every bough,</br>I pray you your music refrain,</br>I've no taste for your melody now.", "My bleaters, your pasture forego,</br>And soothe my complaint with your cries;</br>And, ye breezes that gently do blow,</br>Indulge a reply to my sighs;</br>And Delia, oh!  hear my last wish,</br>While I breathe, it must center in you;</br>A more opulent swain may you bless,</br>But you never can find one more true.</br>"]
