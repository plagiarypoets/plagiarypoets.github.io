["Hark!  how the Sabbath bells salute the sky,</br>Inviting all to seek the house of prayer;</br>I from my window, cast a mournful eye</br>On crowds, who to these hallowed courts repair;</br>And think, how I had wont to mingle there:</br>Yet He whose presence fills created space,</br>Can shed His light to soothe my hours of care;</br>And make my chamber His appointed place</br>Where heavenly Truth shall shine, imparting promised grace.", "Yes, He whose presence was a cloud by day,</br>A fiery pillar each revolving night;</br>In dens of death the lion's rage could stay;</br>And change the furnace to celestial light;</br>Who could arrest the angry prophet's flight,</br>And heard his prayer from Ocean's depths profound;</br>Can make my evening, as the morning bright</br>Chase every grief; and bind each aching wound;</br>Can whisper Peace and Love, diffusing gladness round.", "And He whose hand His chosen people led,</br>Who in the desert, could their wants supply;</br>Who in the wilderness, His prophet fed,</br>When Nature pined beneath a parching sky;</br>Who does not slight the hungry raven's cry;</br>And clothes the spotless lilies of the field;</br>Will not to Man his gracious aid deny,</br>But from His stores each needful comfort yield,</br>His hand with plenty filled; His arm a constant shield.", "Almighty Father!  hear my humble prayer!</br>My sins forgive; increase my faith in Thee,</br>Who say'st, 'Commit thy Orphans to my care,</br>And let thy mourning Widow trust in Me.'</br>My soul from doubt, my heart from care set free;</br>Support and guide me, on my weary way:</br>And in this world, a Friend, and Father be,</br>To those who sigh above my breathless clay;</br>And let us part in hope, to meet in brighter day!</br>"]
