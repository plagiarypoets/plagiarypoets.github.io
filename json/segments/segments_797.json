["Young Hobbinol (the blithest swain)</br>Long time a dupe to haughty Molly;</br>With oaten reed and rustick strain,</br>Now pipes and sings the praise of Dolly,</br>O my Dolly, smiling Dolly,</br>My sweetly blooming, dearest Dolly,</br>Ye woods, ye lawns,</br>Ye flocks, ye fawns,</br>Assist me in the praise of Dolly.", "The dimpl'd cheek, the sooty eye,</br>And ruby lip belong to Molly;</br>But virtue and simplicity,</br>Along bedeck my lovely Dolly.</br>O my Dolly, &c.", "As late I rov'd (my heards astray)</br>I spy'd my love most melancholy;</br>And over-heard the fair one say,</br>Lo!  there's the man that's made for Dolly.</br>O my Dolly, &c.", "We quickly met and down we sate,</br>Then told our loves beneath yon holly;</br>But should I half our joys relate,</br>You'd surely envy me and Dolly.</br>O my Dolly, &c.</br>"]
