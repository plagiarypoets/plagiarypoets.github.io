["Death, on a solemn night of state,</br>In all his pomp of terrors sate:</br>Th' attendants of his gloomy reign,</br>Diseases dire, a ghastly train,</br>Croud the vast court.  With hollow tone</br>A voice thus thunder'd from the throne.", "This night one minister we name,</br>Let ev'ry servant speak his claim;</br>Merit shall bear this eban wand.</br>All, at the word, stretch'd forth their hand.", "Feaver, with burning heat possest,</br>Advanc'd, and for the wand addrest.", "I to the weekly bills appeal,</br>Let those express my fervent zeal,</br>On ev'ry slight occasion near,</br>With violence I persevere.", "Next Gout appears with limping pace,</br>Pleads how he shifts from place to place,</br>And ev'ry joint and sinew plys,</br>Still working when he seems supprest,</br>A most tenacious stubborn guest.", "A haggard spectre from the crew</br>Crawls forth, and thus asserts his due.</br>'Tis I who taint the sweetest joy,</br>And in the shape of love destroy:</br>My thanks, sunk eyes, and noseless face</br>Prove my pretension to the place.", "Stone urg'd his ever-growing force.</br>And, next, Consumption's meagre corse,</br>With feeble voice, that scarce was heard,</br>Broke with short coughs, his suit prefer'd</br>Let none object my lingring way,</br>I gain, like Fabius, by delay,</br>Fatigue and weaken ev'ry foe</br>By long attack, secure though slow.", "Plague represents his rapid power,</br>Who thinn'd a nation in an hour.", "All spoke their claim, and hop'd the wand.</br>Now expectation hush'd the band,</br>When thus the monarch from the throne.", "Merit was ever modest known.</br>What, no physician speak his right!</br>None here!  But sees their toils requite,</br>Let then Intempr'ance take the wand,</br>Who fills with gold their zealous hand.</br>You, Feaver, Gout, and all the rest,</br>(Whom wary men, as foes, detest,)</br>Forgo your claim; no more pretend:</br>Intemp'rance is esteem'd a friend,</br>He shares their mirth, their social joys,</br>And, as a courted guest, destroys;</br>The charge on him must justly fall,</br>Who finds employment for you all.</br>"]
