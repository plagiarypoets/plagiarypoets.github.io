["How mournful feeble Nature's tone,</br>When Dilston Hall appears,</br>Where none's to wail the orphan's moan,</br>Nor dry the widow's tears.", "The helpless aged poor survey</br>This building as it stands,</br>In moving anguish heard to say,</br>(And weeping wring their hands.)", "The bounteous Earl, he is no more,</br>Who once adorn'd this plain,</br>Reliev'd the needy at his door,</br>And freely did sustain:", "Here flowing plenty once did reign,</br>Which gladden'd every face;</br>But now, alas!  reversed scene,</br>For owls a dwelling place.", "The tim'rous deer hath left the lawn,</br>The oak a victim falls,</br>The gentle trav'ller sighs when shown</br>These desolated walls.", "Each gen'rous mind emotion feels,</br>With pious pity mov'd,</br>No breast its anguish yet conceals,</br>For one so well belov'd.", "Let no unhallow'd tongue, or servile slave,</br>Their partial clamour vent beyond the grave;</br>But let the noble dead his honours wear,</br>His fault deplore, his virtue still revere.</br>Tho' err he did, he finish'd the debate,</br>With his own blood, and Ratcliffe's fair estate.</br>The aged farmer, tott'ring o'er the green,</br>Leans on his staff, recounts the days he's seen,</br>Informs the list'ning youth by his record,</br>How bless'd his roof, how plenteous was his board,</br>Not rack'd by Derwent's hospitable lord.</br>He stops his tale, involv'd in grief profound;</br>He sighs, he weeps, he feebly strikes the ground;</br>Cries, why rehearse these golden days of yore,</br>Since they to me, to me can be no more?</br>The clement heart, and curious often calls,</br>To view the naked park and stripped walls;</br>The dampish walls, their stony tears impart,</br>As if their master's wound had pierc'd their heart.</br>Ye pensive mutes, 'tentive on Dilston wait,</br>And mourn eternal Ratcliffe's tragic fate.</br>"]
