["THE PASTORAL.</br>In Arcadie, a place of great renowne</br>Famous for flowery pastures, there remaind</br>A youthfull shepherd, who upon the down,</br>Hight Idas plaine, such honour had

was nam'd</br>Not of that honour might he be asham'd,</br>For many shepheards then there were, whose grace</br>In active feats put Heroes out of place.", "Tmolus was one of such a noble spirit</br>Adornd with beautie and perfection too,</br>That in all actions he the wreath did merit</br>Decking with laurell his victorious brow.</br>Was praisd of all, yet never would he heare it,</br>Nor of vaine glorie least appearance show:</br>Such store of graces from his minde did flow;</br>Of able bodie, and of pregnant wit,</br>That even these times have much admired it:</br>For manie laies would Tmolus oftimes make</br>In divine measures for Amyclas sake.", "Next him was Thyrsus of a comely hew</br>A pure complexion, and a pleasant grace,</br>Who to his friend prov'd faithfull still and true.</br>With painted smile nere would he soile his face:</br>For he descended from a noble race,</br>As his admired vertues still did shew:</br>For fame and honour ever did revew,</br>The spacious mansions of this shepheards place</br>Walking with honour in his parents trace,</br>Such was this Thyrsus (Thyrsus was his name)</br>Nor of that title might he thinke't a shame.", "Pelorus was the third, a lustie swaine</br>That us'd to graise his cattell by the river</br>Euenus hight:  where oft he would complaine,</br>Of his hardhearted love:  nor would he ever</br>Those pensive odes (in silent woes) containe</br>But chaunts his passions ore and ore againe:</br>Such brinie streams could be exempted never,</br>For light (which lightsome seems) his joies

doest exile me from thy presence deere?</br>Why shouldst thou with thy loure benight my day</br>And racke my intrals with perpetuall feare?</br>I pray thee (love) more cheerefully appeare,</br>Feede not my passions with a long delay,</br>But let the night at last my griefes allay,</br>That I some pleasant harmonie may heare,</br>Sounding a concord in my dolefull eare,</br>O be so kinde, that if no day, yet night</br>May yeelde me comfort and renew delight.", "Thus would Pelorus iterate his woe</br>And make the pastures eccho with his voice,</br>For to what cave soere this swaine would did goe</br>He made it answer with an horrid noise,</br>For where he was no creature could rejoyce,</br>Sith what he did, his cattell would doe so,</br>Both foode and water willing to forego,</br>And frame their routing to their Maisters choice</br>A discord well concording with his voice,</br>His flockes were thankefull to deplore his fall</br>Mourning to heare their Maisters mournfull call.", "Manie fine bowers this shepheard used to frame</br>Of mirtle braunches, and of poplar greene,</br>Whereine he usd to endorse his lovers name,</br>Whose curious workes to this day may be seene,</br>Which cannot chuse but aeternise his fame</br>And that renowmed house from whence he came,</br>For few such swaines on earth have ever beene</br>Of such respect, such vertue, such esteeme:</br>But he is gone, and hath depriv'd the earth</br>Of her chiefe beautie, portraied in his birth.", "Tymallus was the next, who for his strength</br>Antaeus like, regaind the highest

discontents)</br>Changing the nature of those elements,</br>Which in Tymallus did so sympathise,</br>That I have heard, though this same shepheard dies,</br>Yet everie yeere the inhabitants

of honour, vertues continent,</br>Shine ever bright to grace that ornament,</br>Which thou possessest:  let no private staine</br>Blemish that poore remainder, whose pure name</br>Makes earth, no

their God, by which their flocks did feede,</br>And their encrease on Ida first began,</br>Therefore each swaine with all the speed he can,</br>Came with sweete incense from his flourie mede,</br>To sacrifice to Pan of all their breed,</br>One with a kid, another with a lambe,</br>Or some young suckling wained from the damme,</br>Mongst whom Berillus came willing to offer,</br>To Pales incense,
