["When forc'd the dear fair-one to leave,</br>I strove how to smother each sigh,</br>But my bosom with anguish did heave</br>When the tear 'gan to steal from her eye:</br>I gaz'd at her form, whilst in view,</br>Till its beauty could hardly be seen;</br>With her hand then she bade me adieu&mdash;</br>So ended the love-parting scene.", "Her air is so comely and meek,</br>Such sweetness her features disclose,</br>The colour that glows on her cheek</br>Cannot be outvied by the rose:</br>Now she's absent whose form charms the sight,</br>My friends to amuse try in vain;</br>And diversions which once gave delight,</br>Cannot now tend to soften my pain.", "Methinks I should like to retire</br>To a cottage well-shaded with trees,</br>With a garden my friends might admire,</br>Where sweets will invite busy bees;</br>My fields should be cover'd with sheep,</br>And the throstles in descants would join,</br>Whose carols might lull me to sleep,</br>While on the green bank I'd recline.", "With the lark let me rise ev'ry morn,</br>To welcome the prime of each day,</br>In the evening my woodbines adorn,</br>Or the lute may drive sorrows away:</br>Each rustic, while homeward he goes,</br>Would listen to hear the soft strain;</br>The delight which such music bestows</br>Might assist to diminish my pain.</br>"]
