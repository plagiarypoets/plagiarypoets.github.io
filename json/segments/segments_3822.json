["Sweet Flora, revisit our Isle,</br>Come quickly, and lead up the May;</br>For, ah!  how I suffer the while</br>Soft Zeph'rus and thou art away.</br>Now howls the North Wind round my Cot,</br>My Cot by the Stream's frozen Side;</br>Ah!  lest I grow sick of my Lot,</br>Bid the rigorous Season subside.", "From th' Elder-tree melt the pale Snow,</br>'Tis Time she had put forth her Green;</br>Again bid the Rivulet flow,</br>And with Primroses brighten the Scene.</br>New robe the tall King of the Grove,</br>Bid the Birch and the Poplar look gay;</br>Bid the Eglantine form an Alcove,</br>And Dog-roses blush on the Spray.", "Again bid the Hawthorn-tree charm,</br>That the Bee may replenish her Hive;</br>That the Finch may be shelter'd from Harm,</br>And her Nestlings in Safety survive.</br>Bid the Horn-beam its Foliage untwine,</br>To harbour the innocent Dove;</br>Where (safe from the Rustick's Design)</br>She may rear her calm Offspring of Love.", "Bid Zephyr diffuse his soft Gale,</br>That my Sheep on the Hare-bells may feed;</br>Wake the Vi'let that sleeps in the Vale,</br>With the Cowslips which droop on the Mead.</br>Let the Furze yield its Blossoms of Gold,</br>Bid the Tansy perfume the still Glade;</br>Let the wild Thyme its Flow'rets unfold,</br>And Sweet-briar spring in the Shade.", "Bid the Clover in Fragrancy yield,</br>Bid the Mower refurbish his Scythe;</br>Bid the Pea-blossoms garnish the Field,</br>That my Phoebe may gather a Tythe.</br>Of the fairest that blow on the Plain,</br>Of the sweetest that spring in the Grove,</br>To wreath (gentle Goddess) thy Fane,</br>For thou art the Mother of Love.</br>"]
