["Oh!  I have seen the crested plumes wave high,</br>Have seen the haughty banner lift its head;</br>And I have watch'd the glance from Beauty's eye,</br>That round the warrior's brow a glory shed,&mdash;</br>Beam'd for an instant, and then vanished,</br>Like a bright flash of lightning from the sky,</br>That o'er the darksome plain a radiance spread,</br>And gilds th' expanse of Heav'n's blue canopy,</br>My path was once as bright, but happiness has fled.", "And I have heard the peeling organ swell</br>Its choral anthem through the fretted aisle;</br>Have heard the distant sound of convent bell</br>Chime its last vesper through the lengthen'd pile,</br>And my young heart has throbb'd with joy the while.</br>And I have watch'd the moon-beam's latest ray,</br>That decks the valleys with a parting smile,</br>Then darts a lustre ere she fades away,</br>To light the traveller's path along the deep defile.", "And I have heard the tempest whistling round</br>The ivied ruins of some ancient tower,</br>Whose crumbling walls, now bending to the ground,</br>Have shelter'd Innocence in ruthless hour,</br>When the soft brow of Friendship 'gan to lour.</br>And I have heard the foaming billows roar,</br>And their rude waves have visited my bower,</br>As though they sought to kiss the verdant shore</br>Before the storm should burst with unrelenting power.", "And I have seen the death-bed of the brave,</br>And heard the hero breathe his latest sigh;</br>Have seen fair Beauty bending o'er the grave,</br>Telling her sorrows to each passer-by:</br>And I have mark'd her softly beaming eye,</br>Whose sadness spoke no language of despair,</br>Turn'd with exulting hope toward the sky,</br>As though they saw her bleeding lover there,</br>Crown'd with a laurel wreath whose verdure cannot die.", "Yes &mdash; scenes like these my youthful heart has known,</br>When life was new, and Hope's fair star was bright;</br>But gaiety's light wing has never flown</br>Since lov'd Olivia vanish'd from my sight,</br>And left me buried in the shades of night.</br>No syren voice now greets my list'ning ear&mdash;</br>No gentle hand supports my languid frame&mdash;</br>No angel sweetness calms my madness here:</br>The world to me is nought &mdash; alike its praise or blame.", "Sorrow has spread her sable pall for me,</br>And Death has pierc'd me with his 'vengeful dart;</br>But I would hail the stroke that sets me free,</br>And gives Olivia back my wounded heart,</br>And bids us meet, aye, never more to part.</br>But thoughts like these, for me, are idle dreams;</br>Yet welcome sleep, that gives my spirit peace,</br>And sheds athwart my soul Hope's radiant beams,</br>That for an instant shine, to bid my sorrows cease!</br>"]
