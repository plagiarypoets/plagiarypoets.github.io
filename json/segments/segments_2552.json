["See hoary winter comes, with dreadful storms,</br>Of rattling hail, and soft descending snow,</br>To rule the circling year,</br>And nature's face deform.", "And, hark!  rude Boreas howls the trees among,</br>His keen, rough blasts lay bare the leafy grove,</br>And not a songster tunes</br>His soft and trilling lay.", "But underneath some hedge, or straw built house</br>The warblers sit disconsolate and sad,</br>Where oft the school-boy tries</br>To catch the plumy throng.", "When Eve, chaste nymph, shall close the eye of day,</br>And twinkling myriads, o'er the blue expanse,</br>Their gentle influence lend</br>To chase the hov'ring gloom;", "Then frost, all potent, with his icy chains,</br>Binds the soft glebe, and stops the bubbling rill,</br>And ev'n the loud cascade</br>Forgets his thund'ring roar.", "The rapid streams, in which the finny race</br>Swam sportive, are to slipp'ry ice congeal'd,</br>And o'er their surface glides</br>With joy each blooming swain.</br>"]
