["Oh Corydon, where dost thou stray?</br>To what far distant clime art thou flown,</br>Where Fame ne'er extended her sway,</br>Where the Muse and her lute are unknown?", "Are the nymphs of those vallies more fair?</br>Are the charms they possess more divine?</br>Ah!  inconstant!  how oft didst thou swear,</br>That no beauty cou'd please thee but mine!", "Fond fool that I was, to believe</br>Such language cou'd never beguile!</br>That vows were not made to deceive,</br>Or falshood to lurk in a smile!", "Oh Memory!  why the soft scene</br>Of our loves dost thou ever renew?</br>Oh why still in vain o'er the green</br>Do my eyes a false rover pursue?", "Oblivion!  sweet balm of our woes,</br>Where, where thy calm spring shall I find?</br>Its wave shall restore my repose,</br>And banish his form from my mind.", "Ah no!  thus engrav'd on my heart,</br>What charm can his image remove?</br>That will ne'er be erased by art,</br>Which was drawn by the pencil of Love.</br>"]
