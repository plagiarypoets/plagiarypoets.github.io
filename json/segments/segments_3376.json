["Sweet Morn of Life!  All hail!  Ye hours of ease!</br>When blooms the cheek with roseate varying dies,</br>When modest grace exerts each power to please,</br>And streaming lustre radiates in the eyes.</br>Thy past hours, innocent; thy present, gay;</br>Thy future, halcyon Hope depicts without allay.", "Day-spring of Life!  Oh stay thy fleeting hours!</br>Thou fairy-reign of ev'ry pleasant thought!</br>Fancy, to cheer thy path, strews all her flowers,</br>And in her loom thy plan of years is wrought.</br>By thee for goodness is each heart carest;</br>The world, untried, is judg'd by that within thy breast.", "Sweet state of Youth!  O harmony of Soul!</br>Now chearful dawns the day; noon brightly beams;</br>And evening comes serene, nor cares controul;</br>And night approaches with soft infant dreams.</br>Circling the morn beholds th' accustom'd round,</br>Life's smiling charities awake, and joys abound.", "Season of hope, and peace, and virtues!  stay!</br>And, for my bliss &mdash; with inexperience rest!</br>For what can prudent foresight's beam display?&mdash;</br>Why &mdash; the barbed arrow pointed at my breast!&mdash;</br>Teach to suspect the heart I guileless trust!</br>And, ere I am betrayed, to think a friend unjust.", "Thou candid Age!  with ardent Friendship fraught,</br>That fearless confidence to none denies:</br>Better sometimes deceiv'd &mdash; and artless, taught</br>By thine own griefs, the wisdom of the wise.</br>When sad Experience with sorrowing breath,</br>Sheds, weeping sheds, the pristine roses in Hope's wreath.", "Season belov'd!  Ah, doom'd to pass away!</br>With all thy freshness, all thy flatt'ring joys,</br>With blooming Beauty's envied, powerful sway,</br>With laughing hours the future ne'er annoys.</br>Ah!  be thou spent as Vertue bids thee spend!</br>Then &mdash; though I wish thy stay, no sighs thy reign shall end.</br>"]
