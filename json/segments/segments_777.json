["Why, Lucy, shou'd we blame our Stars, that they</br>Our Loves or interrupt, or separate;</br>Or cruelly combine their partial Sway,</br>To make our mutual Joys the less compleat?</br>Our Stars themselves know Change as well as we,</br>And sudden Clouds their spangled Glories hide;</br>Yet soon those Clouds withdraw, and then we see,</br>Apace they triumph, and resume their Pride:</br>The same Vicissitude all Nature shares,</br>Dies or revives, looks gay or gloomy, like the Stars.", "Tho' Winter Frosts deform the bless'd Retreat</br>Of rural Innocence, and artless Love;</br>And drive the Turtle from his constant Mate,</br>Alone to wander thro' the leafless Grove:</br>Yet soon as genial Spring renews the Shade,</br>Beneath the wonted Bower the Lover tells</br>His mighty Anguish to the list'ning Maid,</br>Whilst she in Blushes all her Flame reveals.</br>The Turtle moans his Solitude no more,</br>But sooths his Mate, and bills as closely as before.", "Whilst amorous Thames, thro' many a Winding, wooes</br>The briny Thetis to his oozy Bed;</br>The conscious Goddess owns his faithful Vows,</br>And in her Bosom folds her dewy Head;</br>But at the Moon's Command flies far away;</br>Severe her Laws the rigid Planet keeps,</br>And the unwilling Lover must obey,</br>The Goddess murmurs, and the River weeps;</br>Till at her gracious Nod they rush amain,</br>And lose their blending Streams in boundless Joys again.", "Then think not, Lucy, Pleasure is no more,</br>Nor of our present, hapless Lot complain;</br>Another Change will our past Joys restore,</br>And we shall live to meet, and love again.</br>As well may pious Saints bemoan their Fate,</br>When they are summon'd to resign their Breath,</br>And leave the Pleasures of a mortal State,</br>To wander in the dreary Vale of Death.</br>But O, blest Change!  when once the Pilgrims prove</br>The Muse of the Spheres, and taste seraphic Love.</br>"]
