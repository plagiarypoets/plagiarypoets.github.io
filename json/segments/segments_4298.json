["Form'd to restore, with Judgment's steady hand,</br>A better image of thy Master's law</br>Than the false glare of cold Corruption's brand</br>Permits her hood-wink'd sycophants to draw</br>Thy spirit, Watson, the dark shadows saw</br>Which greedy Priesthood scatters o'er his shrine,</br>The whiles swoln Luxury feasts her filthy maw,</br>Sinking to earth the precious spark divine.</br>Mourning to see obstructed Genius pine</br>In the damp mists of Penury's chill night</br>Fell thy strong blow with well-resolv'd design</br>To break the veil from Scrutiny's clear light.</br>Blest work!  which, spite of sneaking Avarice' blame,</br>And Power's rough arm, shall blaze thro' endless time thy name.</br>"]
