["Sun, with Light peculiar shining,</br>Usher in the smiling Morn,</br>Round thy Head thy Glories twining</br>Bid th' auspicious Day be born;</br>Bid the Hours with nimblest Paces</br>Free and frolick to advance,</br>And bid Venus lend her Graces</br>Tripping at thy Wheels to dance.", "Think how swift, when once a Lover,</br>Skimming o'er the Plains you flew,</br>When the charming cruel Rover</br>Bad a God in vain pursue.</br>Think how deeply you were wounded,</br>When you stretch'd your eager Arms,</br>And a lifeless Trunk surrounded</br>For your Daphne's sprightly Charms.", "By the Pains with which you languish'd,</br>By the Joys you then desir'd,</br>By the Youth's impatient Anguish</br>Keen with Expectation fir'd;</br>Swiftly speed the Heav'ns over,</br>But that happy Minute rest,</br>When you see a luckier Lover</br>By a fairer Daphne blest.</br>"]
