["Is then the fairy dream for ever clos'd?</br>And the pomp gone on which my soul repos'd?</br>Alas!  the hated hiss I'm doom'd to hear,</br>Derides the power it once was forc'd to fear;</br>A hundred tongues united joyful roar</br>\"P&mdash;ll&mdash;ps, that God, is Proctor now no more.\"</br>Farewell the grand ideas the mind receives</br>From the black Majesty of velvet sleeves:</br>Farewell the ermin'd hood, my Sunday pride;</br>Farewell the task for various use apply'd:</br>Farewell the streets I walk'd, elate with pow'r,</br>Seeking, like Satan, whom I might devour.</br>Farewell my liveried Slaves, that walk'd behind,</br>In white-brown cloaks that flutter'd in the wind.</br>Farewell the lore I practic'd with delight;</br>The useful lore of pow'r implying right:</br>Now haughty wh-res my steps untrembling meet;</br>And snap their scornful fingers in the street.</br>No more the Raphs avoid me as I come,</br>Tho' once they trembled at my \"fe, fa, fum:\"</br>The social band no more my jokes admire;</br>Hand me my glass, and place me by the fire.</br>No more the wonder of the Common Room&mdash;</br>The Rose becomes a Thorn when lost its bloom.</br>The flattering cry's no longer now, \"Fellow,</br>Was ever man so great, so wise as thou?\"</br>But a pert moral from old Aesop gathers,</br>That Daws at last must lose their peacocks feathers,</br>From all the bliss these scenes of pow'r bestow,</br>Back to the land renown'd for goats I go&mdash;</br>No longer doom'd a magistrate to reign,</br>Behold the potent pedagogue again,</br>Now mighty terrors glow in little hearts,</br>And bums instinctive feel unwonted smarts.</br>Thus Dionysius from his throne expell'd,</br>An equal place in pompous Corinth held:</br>In Kings and Pedagogues the pow'rs the same,</br>And rods and sceptres vary but in name.</br>"]
