["How pleasingly glided my days,</br>When Colin cou'd banish each care:</br>My woodlands resounded his praise,</br>I gave all distress to the air.</br>With hearts bound in friendship we rov'd,</br>Nor fear'd the approach of the night;</br>His presence alone then I lov'd,</br>Each scene still renew'd my delight.", "My kidlings they sport in the mead,</br>My flocks now are teeming with young:</br>The dance of the green oft I lead,</br>Or sooth my despair with a song.</br>But still in thy absence I find,</br>Each bliss as imperfect at best;</br>I picture my friend in my mind,</br>While doubts are disturbing my breast.", "Thus deign, my dear Colin, again</br>To visit with friendship my cot:</br>Alleviate my bosom from pain,</br>In thee let all care be forgot.</br>Then roving we'll waste the long day,</br>Each choose out the damsel he loves;</br>If Phoebus his splendour display,</br>With jollity seek the alcoves.</br>"]
