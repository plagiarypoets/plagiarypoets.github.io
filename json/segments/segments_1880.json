["Simplicity, thou lovely fair!</br>To thee the Muse devotes her song;</br>To thee directs her ardent pray'r;</br>For thee she leaves the civic throng,</br>Who vainly chase the baseless joys</br>Which ev'ry empty breeze destroys.", "To gain the courtier's faithless smile,</br>Amid the glare of courts to shine,</br>Let giddy mortals idly toil,</br>I'll seek thy calm sequester'd shrine,</br>Where health, content and peace unite,</br>To give the soul supreme delight.", "How sweet, fair nymph!  with thee to dwell</br>Where vernal beauty's clothe the field;</br>How sweet to view thy rugged cell,</br>Beneath the moss-grown rock conceal'd,</br>Where Contemplation's heav'nly beams</br>Exalt wild Fancy's airy dreams.", "How sweet with Innocence to rove</br>Amid thy soft bewitching throng,</br>Who tread the pleasing paths of love,</br>And sweetly raise the rural song,</br>That soothes the fondly-listening ear,</br>And melts the souls of those who hear.", "Haste then, dear nymph, with brow serene</br>Conduct me to thy sylvan seat,</br>Haste, lead me to the peaceful scene,</br>Where thou hast fix'd thy blest retreat,</br>And there with fond regard I'll pay</br>The tribute of a rustic lay.", "Beneath yon shade, behind yon thorn,</br>Where Nature's songsters raise the strain,</br>With thee I'll pass the chearful morn,</br>Remote from sorrow, grief and pain,</br>Save when the sadly plaintive note</br>Bursts from sweet Philomela's throat.", "Oft on yon blooming bed of flow'rs,</br>Whose balmy fragrance scents the gale,</br>With thee I'll pass the noon-tide hours,</br>Intent to hear the shepherd's tale,</br>Which flows from thy exhaustless store,</br>And gives me joys unknown before.", "Oft when the shades of ev'ning fall,</br>And Cynthia beams with borrow'd light,</br>On thee, delightful nymph!  I'll call,</br>To show the rock's stupendous height,</br>Where all thy beauties strike the eye</br>With grandeur pomp and majesty.", "Oft will I seek the mountain's brow,</br>Where midnight fairies join the ring,</br>Where tuneful streamlets sweetly flow,</br>And prompt the sylvan Muse to sing,</br>And there, from pride, from envy free,</br>I'll dedicate myself to thee.</br>"]
