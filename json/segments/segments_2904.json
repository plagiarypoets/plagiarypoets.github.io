["Time, awful power, that rulest o'er all;</br>By rich, by poor, unbribed, unpitying found;</br>Beneath whose arm triumphant heroes fall,</br>And golden palaces bestrew the desert ground:", "Too long, whene'er thou hast renew'd</br>The flowery foliage, or matured the plain,</br>Have War, and Ruin fell, his hated brood,</br>And Death untimely, lower'd amid thy mournful train;", "While daunted at thy brow severe</br>Spring check'd her joy, the bloom of Summer fled;</br>Autumn sate weeping on his sheaves, and near</br>Ev'n sullen Winter wore a thrilling gloom more dread.", "O, as thou hold'st thy ceaseless course,</br>Grown milder now, great Power; with Peace combined,</br>Driving far off grim War, and lawless Force,</br>Thy formidable locks with lasting olive bind.", "So may the fields revive, and late</br>Where Desolation triumph'd, Plenty reign:</br>By Fear withheld, though morning at his fate,</br>So may the labourer ply his cheerful toil again!", "Calm Nature's voice, and wood-notes sweet,</br>The din of loud artillery succeed;</br>Commerce a world's returning treasure greet;</br>Nor sad Britannia more, begirt with trophies, bleed.</br>"]
