["Methought that I did stand upon a tomb&mdash;</br>And all was silent as the dust beneath,</br>While feverish thoughts upon my soul would come,</br>Losing my words in tears:  I thought of death;</br>And prayed that when my lips gave out the breath,</br>The friends I loved like life might stay behind:</br>So, for a little while, my name might eath</br>Be something dear, &mdash; spoken with voices kind,</br>Heard with remembering looks, from eyes which tears would blind!", "I prayed that I might sink unto my rest,</br>(O foolish, selfish payer!) before them all;</br>So I might look my last on those loved best&mdash;</br>So never would my voice repining call,</br>And never would my tears impassioned fall</br>On one familiar face turning to clay!</br>So would my tune of life be musical,</br>Albeit abrupt &mdash; like airs the Spaniards play,</br>Which in the sweetest part, break off, and die away.", "Methought I looked around!  the scene was rife</br>With little vales, green banks, and waters heaving;</br>And every living thing did joy in life,</br>And every thing of beauty did seem living&mdash;</br>Oh, then, life's pulse was at my heart reviving;</br>And then I knew that it was good to bear</br>Dispensed woe, that by the spirit's grieving,</br>It might be weaned from a world so fair!&mdash;</br>Thus with submissive words mine heart did close its prayer.</br>"]
