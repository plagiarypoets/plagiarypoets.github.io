["When Jove ambitious by his former sinnes,</br>(From him al Muses, so my Muse beginnes)</br>Deposde his Syre Saturnus from the throne,</br>And so usurpt the Diadem alone:</br>Some higher power for aged Saturne strove,</br>Gave him a gift, which angred lust-stung Jove:</br>A lovely boy, whose beautie at his birth,</br>Made poore the heav'ns to enrich the earth.</br>(When Jove no beautie in the heavens found,</br>Was he not angry?  yea, and to the ground</br>Sent Mercurie, to wooe a shepheards swaine,</br>Whilst he himselfe came in a showre of raine:</br>Whose drizling drops fell into Danaes lappe,</br>Which to receive, (maides wil receive such happe)</br>She held hir skirt, Jove such abundance powred,</br>Twentie to one but Danae was deflowred.)</br>His name was Pycus, yet surnam'd the Faire,</br>Whom Circe chaunted in her scorne-gold haire,</br>Whom Ladies lov'd, and loved of so many,</br>The wood-Nymphes woo'd him, yet not won of any,</br>Till Canens came, (who when she gan to sing,</br>The ayrie Bird would hoover with her wing,</br>To heare her notes, for Canens she was call'd,</br>Of singing sweete) and Pycus heart enthrall'd:</br>Not married long, but Canens did enjoy</br>Of fairest father, farre more faire a boy,</br>(That heav'n, and earth, in bringing forth these two,</br>Made a great bragge that so much they could do:)</br>Faunus a boy whose amber-stragling haires,</br>So strangely trammeld all about his eares,</br>The crispe dishevel'd playing with the winde,</br>Among the thickest, never way could finde,</br>But sweetest flowers would leape from Floraes lap,</br>And so themselves within his tresses wrap.</br>That glad he was those lockes (those lockes alone,</br>Those lockes that lockt in bondage many one:)</br>With carelesse art, or artlesse care infolde,</br>And draw them in a coronet of golde.</br>If bashfulnesse enveloped his face,</br>A prettie palenesse damask't such sweet grace,</br>Like Daisie with the Gilliflower distill'd,</br>Or Roses on a bed of Lillies spill'd:</br>Or rather when the wood-Nimphs gazing stood,</br>Love like a tyrant therein threatned blood:</br>His eies were such, my Muse yet hardly can</br>Emblazon forth the beutie of a man:</br>My dullard muse to sing it may suffize,</br>Of his rich coate he wore in wondrous guize:</br>The ground whereof was velvet, white as snow,</br>Reaching unto the ankles downe below,</br>With buttons made of Diamonds upon,</br>Such as our knights of th' order first put on:</br>Upon the left side it no fastning had,</br>But on the right side with a pearle staide,</br>Upon th' one shoulder where the two ends met,</br>Were both together, with a jewell set,</br>On top whereof in lively forme did stand,</br>Great Hercules with distaffe in his hand:</br>To every seame were fastned ribonings,</br>With stories wrought of Emperours and Kings:</br>And at each ribbon hung a pretious stone,</br>(Loves chiefe disport consists in these alone)</br>Which were faire Ladies costly Amatists,</br>Tide to the tender small leav'de ozear twists,</br>That so they might his ribbons enterlace,</br>When he pursude the nimble Hart in chace:</br>And she grew prowd, and held the rest in scorne,</br>That knew her favour by yong Faunus worne.</br>Poudred upon so strange, that many thought</br>With purple coloured silke it had beene wrought:</br>But (ah alas) it was the crimson staine,</br>Of goddesses, which Faunus lookes had slaine:</br>About his necke he wore a falling band,</br>Which tooke it pride from his faire mothers hand:</br>His ivory feete, appearing unto sight,</br>In murrey velvet, buskins rich were dight,</br>The middle slits with tyrian Bisse were laced,</br>Whose prettie knots his man-like legge embraced.</br>In many places bare as use hath bin,</br>To shew the clearenesse of the naked skin.</br>The wanton boy attired in this sort,</br>Unto the Latian mountaines did resort;</br>Whose prowde height garnisht with such stately trees,</br>Seemde to contemne the vally at his knees,</br>The humble vally in as good a state:</br>(But loftie Gallants lower minds do hate)</br>Was still replenisht with a pleasant river,</br>(Prowd of the gift, and yet more prowd the giver,)</br>Whose wanton streames the bank so oft do kisse,</br>That in her lap (at length) he falling is:</br>Her bubbling water with slow gliding pace,</br>Shews her great griefe to leave that pleasant place:</br>And with a murmure when she goes away.</br>Greatly laments she can no longer stay,</br>Cause th' upper streams by violence would come,</br>To take possession of that joyfull roome,</br>With swift pursute, and as they gin to chace it,</br>The bankes like armes doe lovingly imbrace it:</br>Whose purling noise upon the pibble stones,</br>For such departure are the dolefull grones:</br>Her teares exhalde such norishment doth give,</br>As on the tree-fringd banks made Pleasure live,</br>Among these trees a goodly Cypresse grew,</br>That all the lofty pines did over-view,</br>Who bow'd her faire head (in the sunnie gleames,)</br>To tresse her greene locks by those glassie streams.</br>Her top, her shade, upon the River show'd,</br>For the kind moisture on her root bestow'd,</br>Running upon so delicate a ground,</br>As that the truth could never yet be found:</br>Whether it made the gravell pretious looke,</br>Or else the gravell purifide the brooke:</br>Whose meddowes greene enameled with roses,</br>(Twas Paradise some Poet yet supposes)</br>Added a shew so ruddie, that most deemed</br>The field to blush at his owne beautie seemed.</br>Neare to this valley Shepheards often met,</br>And by this valley sheepish squadrons set,</br>Within this valley past the time away,</br>With leapes and gamboles, and with other play:</br>Here the Nymphes playd such summer games as Base,</br>For it was summer alwaies in this place,</br>And Barlibreake, the which when Faunus saw,</br>So many wood-Nymphes standing on a row:</br>The boy, though yong, (yet who so yong that loves not,</br>Or who so old that womens beautie moves not?)</br>Spide Melliflora:  Melliflora was</br>Among the number sitting on the grasse:</br>Sweete Melliflora I can tell ye true,</br>The grasse grew prowd that under her it grew.</br>Faire Melliflora, amorous, and yong,</br>Whose name, nor story, never Poet sung:</br>She wore a garland wrought with Amorets,</br>With orphrates overlaid and violets,</br>Whose lacinth love-lockes hanged out so faire,</br>As drest the garland, garland drest the haire,</br>And enterlaced with a purle band,</br>(Like cristall Tagus through his golden sand)</br>Which hiding nowe, then hidden by the haire,</br>At fast and loose to play it did appeare,</br>Faire was her face yet fairer might have beene,</br>If that the Sunne so often had not seene</br>Her lovely face, for halfe the day he spent</br>In kissing her, yet never was content:</br>(For God or man thinkes he the Cushion misses,</br>That wooes all day, and winnes nought else but kisses)</br>Untill the sunne with overmuch desire</br>Of love (for love is hotter then the fire)</br>Consumde the wreathe of Diamonds in his throne:</br>(Ovid's beguilde, it was not Phaeton)</br>For Melliflora was the cause he burned,</br>His chariot, and the world to cinders turned.</br>Strange were her weedes to Faunus, yet not strange,</br>For in such weedes the wood-Nymphes use to range,</br>A petticote tuckte even with the knees,</br>Garnisht about with leaves of sundry trees:</br>And sometimes like a net drawne up, and wrought,</br>(Which net the eagle-Iove might well have cought)</br>And all her garments made so light and thin,</br>(Who could restraine but thinke what was within)</br>And blacke silke laces whereon silver bells</br>Did hang above her elbowes, and of shels</br>Her slippers were, her legges, her armes, her brest,</br>In many places naked, yet so drest,</br>As nakednesse another raiment scorned,</br>For she her cloaths, her cloaths not her adorned.</br>Faunus a farre off stood stone-still and gazed,</br>The more he lookt, the more Love inly blazed,</br>He would have quencht it with his teares, but then</br>(A sparke of beautie burnes a world of men)</br>It burnt the more, yet who can well refraine</br>From drinking water, when he feeles the paine</br>Of burning fever, though that water drenches,</br>And turnes to fire, which like Love never quenches:</br>But youth may love, and yongmen may admire,</br>If old age cannot, yet it will desire.</br>For since that time old men of sixty yeeres.</br>(Bearing a beard, or rather, beard them beares)</br>Will heate their blouds with love and yong wives chuse,</br>(At such sweete weddings yongmen nothing loose)</br>Faunus kneel'd downe and unto Venus prayde,</br>Before his prayers were the one halfe said,</br>He thought it best unto the Nimph to write</br>And shew his love, but ginning to indite,</br>He tride the Muses with his often changes,</br>(Love never loves to rest, but alwaies ranges.)</br>If once on Melliflora he did thinke,</br>He wet his paper both with teares and inke:</br>Fearing to end before he had begunne,</br>Mistrusting each word which his wit had done:</br>One was too darke, another was too plaine,</br>This word too loftie, and the other vaine.</br>That set not downe the sorrow of his hart,</br>This shew'd his passion, but it shew'd no Art:</br>He tore his papers, cast away his pen,</br>Sore was he grievde, and yet not angrie (men</br>In true love are not angrie) for he knew,</br>The more hee studied, still the worse it grew:</br>Then he resolvde to take the rose-strowne way,</br>Into the valley where he saw them play,</br>Accosted all with Venus and the Graces:</br>With white haire hiding their enticing faces,</br>Which hand in hand would make a circle round,</br>With often turning, then themselves confound,</br>In Pyrrhus daunce like souldiers armed twine them,</br>And wedge-wise yoked in array combine them.</br>And when he came, that wood-Nymph was most faine,</br>That to their play might Faunus entertaine.</br>And if he spake, the Nymphs drew somewhat neare him,</br>To taste the sirrop of sweete wordes, and heare him.</br>And gray-eyd Dorys she would alwayes eye him,</br>Till she was strucke purblinde she could not see him:</br>Some wisht him sooner (though he came too soone)</br>Before the pleasure of the day was done:</br>Some saide, the night for Lovers was the day,</br>And Love delighted in the night to play,</br>For now the day his office gave to night,</br>To lend our aduerse hemisphere his light.</br>The Nymphs requested Melliflora than,</br>To move this sute to Faunus, she beganne:</br>I would we had such eloquence as might</br>Intreate your Highnesse lodge with us all night,</br>We and our arbour evermore would rest</br>Content, and honourd with so great a ghest:</br>You shall but lie upon a bed of roses,</br>Your sheetes white lillies, pillowes fragrant poses,</br>Your blankets flowerdeluces shall be drawne</br>With prety pinkes, your curtaines leasie lawne,</br>And in my bed, My, unawares out slipt,</br>Her face bewraide how that her tongue had tript,</br>Which Faunus seeing, would have kist her then,</br>To hide those blushes (oh how kind are men!)</br>Fresh she begins, thinking that word to alter,</br>The more she speakes, the more her tongue doth falter,</br>And gainst her will that My she spoke againe,</br>(Love will not let such words be spoke in vaine.)</br>This past as unregarded:  Faunus said,</br>I were inhumane if this were denaid,</br>Orecome with joy, they in the mid rancke set him,</br>He thought their arbour in the midway met him,</br>Such force of Musicke conquerd length of way,</br>With torches making artificiall day.</br>Above all trees in th odoriferous meades,</br>(With greene vine branches, curling their prowd heades,</br>And honni-suckles) at their lodging doore,</br>Doth grow the pleasing brode leav'de Sycamore:</br>Her entrances adornd with pretious stone,</br>Built in the forme of a pavillion:</br>Ridings cut out, so that the eie might judge,</br>What Angells did inhabite in the lodge,</br>And like a comet (yet more pretious farre)</br>Stretching her tale unto a lesser starre,</br>He pointed at a pleasant summer hall,</br>Wherein the Nymphes did use to banquet all,</br>The coloured marble beautified the top,</br>Whose pillars serv'de the house to underprop,</br>And underneath whereas a river rode,</br>Was minerall, her streames an handfull broade,</br>Her shaking Christall was a perfect mirrour,</br>To all the beauties in the garden neare her,</br>Whose water washt them rather they did wash it,</br>For when their snow-white Ivorie hands would plash it,</br>(Like honie-bubbling Ladon; or Pirene,</br>Cleare Castalis, or luke-warme Hippocrene)</br>Upon her face she makes ten thousand lines,</br>Ten thousand Saphir coloured bubbles shines,</br>As not content in large to have their pinctures,</br>In each of them sets forth their lively tinctures:</br>And comes againe to play, embrace, and threaten,</br>And laughes, and smiles, and leapes to be so beaten.</br>Behind this brooke or thicket was a greene,</br>Whereas five hundred grassie rounds had beene</br>Made one in one, like to these water rings,</br>Thence to a gallerie Melliflore him brings,</br>There was Diana:  when Acteon saw her,</br>Bathing her selfe (alas he did not know her)</br>(A goldsmiths wife once nakt without her pearle,</br>Hard to be knowne is from a countrie gerle)</br>A foolish Nimph sate weeping (for love can</br>Make goddesses like women love a man)</br>The posture of whose limmes so lively seated,</br>As Art and Nature Love and Anger freated:</br>Within this gallerie whenas Faunus comes,</br>The grapes with childe, and divers coloured plums,</br>Gave to the eie a pleasant taste, before</br>Unto the mouth they came, and evermore</br>The coole wine fild into the goblet skips,</br>And laughes for joy to come unto such lips:</br>As Faunus drunke, still would he steale a looke,</br>(Thus Faunus swallowed Cupids golden hooke)</br>Then laide his eies wide ope his love to view,</br>(Thus he receiv'd the darts which Cupid threw)</br>Then closde his eie-lids from that glorious light,</br>(Thus he preserv'd the riches of his sight)</br>And thus faire words and power attractive beuty,</br>Bring men to women in subjective duety.</br>But supper ends, and all the Nymphes expected</br>Some amorous talke of Faunus:  he neglected</br>Untill a Nymph (this order yet we use)</br>Sayd, let us husbands in the ashes chuse,</br>In lovers rites, Faunus though rude and raw,</br>It was no dallying, yet with Nimphs he saw,</br>Then smiling said:  Faire Nymphs, the shepheards lasses,</br>Thus chuse them husbands, turning crabs in ashes;</br>If in these woods good husbands be so scant,</br>Will you sweete Nymphes with me supplie some want.</br>But some said nothing, these gave ful consent,</br>And some said twice No, which affirmes content,</br>And some said once No, these would grant and give,</br>In womens mouths, No is no negative:</br>Whereat he blusht, and fearing to offend,</br>The fondling thus abruptly made an end.</br>Sorie (God knowes) the Nymphes were hee had done,</br>Then Deiopeia mongst them all begun</br>To speake, whose words to Beril straight distilld,</br>As from her lippes the orient pearle trilld,</br>Looking at Faunus smilingly then said:</br>A cumbersome companion to a maid</br>Is modesty, our elders all contemn'd it,</br>For cowardize most valiant men condemn'd it,</br>Blushing and sighing Theseus never strove,</br>To woe and winne Antiope his love.</br>Nor would hee have his time so spent and lavisht,</br>But laid her downe, and some say shee was ravisht,</br>And so she was, but ravisht with content,</br>And got with childe, belike both did consent:</br>Stout Hercules yong Ioles father slew,</br>And then by force his force faire Iole knew.</br>Yet this unfathered Ladie would beginne,</br>Most sportfully put on the Lions skinne,</br>And tooke his clubbe betwixt her hands and viewd it,</br>Though shee was ravisht, yet she never rewd it.</br>Soft Menelaus Helen could not brooke,</br>Yet what inforcing Paris gave, she tooke:</br>Women are servants, servants unto men,</br>But praise your servants, what will follow then?</br>A readie horse straight yeeldes when he hath found,</br>One that will have him yeeld, else falles to bound:</br>And thus she parl'de, thus she plainely woode,</br>Yet childish Faunus hardly understood.</br>Untill to bedward all the Nimphes them drest</br>To take their rest, yet tooke no ease in rest:</br>The night beginnes be angrie, when she sees</br>She can distill no sleepe in lovers eies,</br>Tossing her selfe among the cloudes now hath</br>Sent the red morne as Herald of her wrath,</br>Whose lover Phoebus rising from his bed,</br>With his dewie mantle hath the world over-spread,</br>Shaking his tresses over Neptunes ebbe:</br>And giving tincture to the Spiders webbe:</br>These faire Nimphes rose, seeing the light did call them,</br>And fairest Faunus equipaged all them.</br>A fairer bevie of faire virgines never,</br>The worlds faire eie, the Sunne could yet dissever:</br>Their prettie pastimes; and their plaies begunne,</br>At Barlibreake yong Faunus needes must runne,</br>In couples, three, the mid place, called Hell,</br>But since that time the play is knowne too well:</br>With Deiopeia it was Faunus lot,</br>First to be Hell:  they ran, and Syrinx got:</br>Syrinx and Spio so pursude the chase,</br>That Melliflora had the middle place.</br>Her partner Atte at Deiopeia ran,</br>But first for Faunus she her course beganne:</br>He ran, but ranne with eie cast o're his shoulder,</br>Not caring how, so that hee might behold her:</br>She tooke him straight, about his necke she clang,</br>And on the grassie carpet Faunus flang.</br>Willing he was, yet wrastled, strove, and fought,</br>And fell to feele, and said hee was not cought</br>By law of Barlibreake, because hee fell,</br>It was his heav'n, though thus to be in Hell:</br>(For many one for Hell, not Heaven would pray,</br>If such shee divels were in Hell to play.)</br>Longer hee strove, that longer hee might stay,</br>But Deiopeia bade her come away:</br>(For shee poore soule was liver-sicke of love,</br>And fear'd such strife another strife would move.)</br>And yeeld to Faunus, then she parts him froe,</br>(Though she from him, nor he from hir could goe)</br>Let us (she feard againe they would contend)</br>Of Barlibreake for this time make an end,</br>Some other play, some other sport begin,</br>That standers by, and lookers on be in:</br>It ended, thus the other play began,</br>Some fiftie maides, (too many for one man)</br>Tooke hand in hand, which made a spherie round,</br>Or globe the perfectst figure to be found,</br>Then one (whose lot is first among them all)</br>Must goe about and let a napkin fall:</br>And whom soe're it lieth next behind,</br>So soone as ever she the cloth doth find,</br>Must with swift-running foote the other chace,</br>Untill she come unto her ranke and place:</br>If catcht before, the fliers forfeit is,</br>To gratifie the follower with a kisse.</br>The sport begins and Arethusa first,</br>Would have drop-napkin'd Faunus if she durst,</br>But she tooke Doris; Doris at next bout,</br>Kist Melliflora, she fetcht Faunus out:</br>She fled (yet tooke) he follow'd (not forsaken)</br>She ran (yet caught) he follow'd (and was taken)</br>Upon the backe part, fixed she he her eies</br>So firmely, that before she nothing sees.</br>Put downe she falls (the Nymphes began to wonder)</br>Faunus above (but women will lie under:)</br>Gave her the kisse, she (willingly though tooke it,)</br>Gave it againe, the novice then forsooke it:</br>White Nisaee next for Deiopeia prest,</br>And she at Faunus, he could never rest,</br>But either catcht, or else was to be cought,</br>Untill the freshman faint and breathlesse brought</br>With tracing was, (the Nymphes much swifter were)</br>(For love is heavenly light, compact of aire)</br>So that the slow'st among them never misses,</br>But casts him downe, and smothers him with kisses.</br>These gamesome Nimphs, welnere sev'n daies had spent</br>In such like plaies, and sportfull merriment,</br>Faunus thought oft Loves fire for to display,</br>Desire was bolde, but Shamefastnesse said nay.</br>If he began to come but somewhat neare her,</br>His body quak't as though his heart did feare her,</br>All that he said was, Nimph when you are at leasure,</br>Faine would I speak, he might have spoke his pleasure,</br>She found this means, only that he might wooe her,</br>To loose her Necklace let her Caule forgo her,</br>Within the woods, that well she could not weare,</br>Untill she found them, her loose dangling haire,</br>And as she sought them, softly thus would say,</br>I prethee Faunus helpe me, come away,</br>If thou shouldst goe into these woods alone,</br>Thy Melliflore would follow thee away:</br>Wilt thou not come?  beleeve me I must chide,</br>Yet he in love for all this would abide,</br>When for his love, Love fram'de the time most fit,</br>(Boyes love is foolish, Love to youth brings wit.)</br>Then to the hedges walke they on a row,</br>To plucke the sweetes (how sharply sweetes wil grow:)</br>From sharpest stinging hawthorne as they go,</br>Fortune to turne their mirth to sodaine woe:</br>From out the woods did send a fierce wild boare,</br>Which seene (such beasts they never saw before)</br>A care, or feare, or both, did make them trudge,</br>Some to the woods, and some towards the lodge:</br>Some under hedges, some to holes would runne,</br>This way, and that, the best, the beast to shunne:</br>But Melliflore (whose beautie by that passe,</br>Like a rubd rubie much augmented was:</br>Like muske, or civit kept in bosome hot,</br>Her breath most sweete by running sweetnes got,)</br>Kept on her course, yet never lookt behind,</br>Whom Faunus follow'd, whilst a wanton wind,</br>Like to some pleasant civit smelling breath,</br>Would gently play him with her vaile beneath,</br>And come, and go, heave up, throw downe, to show</br>Twise-wounded Faunus, what he did not know:</br>Something he staid his swift pursute with leasure,</br>Fearing to be deprived of such pleasure,</br>But what he saw, tis needlesse for to say,</br>Heere shall your thoughts, and not my pen bewray:</br>But as he gan his swifter running slacke,</br>The anger-froathing boare was at his backe,</br>Which made him turne, and at the boare to thrust,</br>Into whose heart his hand he guided just:</br>He was but armed with a little knife,</br>Some destiny belike preserv'd his life:</br>Yet by this fight he Melliflora lost,</br>So Faunus thought him worse then ever crost.</br>In th' unknowne woods, then up and downe he rangeth,</br>This way for that, that for another changeth:</br>Losing himselfe, within a grove he found</br>Love-sicke Adonis lying on the ground.</br>For hating Love, and saying Venus nay,</br>Yet meeting Melliflora in his way:</br>Love made (Love weepe to see thy tyrannie,)</br>Adonis frustrate his vow'd chastitie:</br>Whilst narrowly upon her lookes he spide,</br>Strooke with loves arrow, he fell downe and dide.</br>For by the Bore (as all our Poets faine,)</br>He was not kilde, Faunus the Bore had slaine.</br>But tracing further, who but Venus met him,</br>Thinking he had beene Adon, thus she gret him:</br>Welcome Adonis, in thy lovelie breast</br>Now do I see remorse and pitie rest,</br>Which to returne my deare Adonis moved,</br>Venus perswades her selfe she is beloved:</br>Hoping to have some water from the rocke,</br>Which shee had pierst, she stript her to the smocke:</br>Wrought all in flames of Chrisolite and gold,</br>And bout his necke her armes she did enfold:</br>So (at the least) shee meaning to have kist him</br>He turn'de aside:  then sorie cause shee mist him,</br>To Faunus said, faire Saint, shun not such kindnesse,</br>Can these bright eies be blemisht with such blindnesse?</br>If thou wert blind, and Venus could not see,</br>Yet in the darke best sighted lovers be:</br>Or give, or take, or both, relent, be kind,</br>Locke not Love in the paradize of thy mind:</br>Is Venus lovely?  then Adonis love her.</br>Is she the Queene of love?  then what should move her</br>To sue and not command?  Is shee loves mother?</br>Shall she be loath'd, which brings love to all other?</br>With that she doft all to the Ivorie skinne,</br>Thinking her naked glorie would him winne.</br>The shamefac't Faunus thereat something smiled,</br>Venus lookt on him, knew shee was beguiled:</br>Yet would have lov'd him for Adonis sake,</br>(Thus women will one for another take.)</br>Faunus resisted, Venus would no more</br>Sollicite him, but mounted as before</br>In her light Chariot drawne with milke-white Doves,</br>Away she flies:  Faunus left in the groves</br>No sooner had the wood him passage lent,</br>But home to see his father Faunus went.</br>Picus much wondred where his sonne had beene,</br>Whom of seven daies and more he had not seene:</br>But sleeplesse nights, his being soone revealed,</br>With sighes and teares (Love cannot be concealed.)</br>His father by his countenance espide him</br>To be in love, and mildely thus gan chide him:</br>Fond Boy, quoth hee, and foolish cradle witted,</br>To let base love with thy yong yeares be fitted:</br>This upstart love, bewitcher of the wit,</br>The scorne of vertue, vices parasite:</br>The slave to weakenesse, friendships false bewrayer,</br>Reasons rebell, Fortitudes betraier:</br>The Church-mens scoffe, court, camp, and countrie's guiler,</br>Arts infection, chaste thoughts and youth's defiler.</br>And what are women?  painted weathercocks,</br>Natures oversight, wayward glittring blocks:</br>True, true-bred cowards, proude if they by coide,</br>A servile sex, of wit and reason voide:</br>Shall women move thee, whom so many loathes,</br>In gaudie plumes trickte, and new-fangled cloathes?</br>Thus in our find-fault age, many a man</br>Will fondly raile with foule-mouth'd Mantuan.</br>Some sharpe witted, only in speaking evill,</br>Would prove a woman worse then any divell</br>With prating Picus:  though that women be,</br>Fram'd with the same parts of the minde as we.</br>Nay, Nature triumpht in their beauteous birth,</br>And women made the glorie of the earth:</br>The life of Beautie, in whose supple breasts,</br>As in her fairest lodging vertue rests.</br>Whose towring thoughts attended with remorce,</br>Doe make their fairenesse be of greater force.</br>But of this subject everie day who reades not,</br>Which is so praised, as it praises needs not?</br>And my conceite not able for to reach them,</br>Might bring forth words for praise, which might impeach them:</br>And so with love tis easie to find fault,</br>Yet not so easie when it gives assault:</br>Then to resist his force, whose excellence</br>Is to transforme the verie soule and essence</br>Of the lover, into the thing beloved:</br>This heavenly love (no doubt) yong Faunus moved:</br>But (all this while being dumbe) Faunus replide</br>Unto his father, and withall denide</br>He lov'd a woman:  then his father knew</br>From whence his griefe and melancholy grew,</br>And that he was by some wood-Nymph accosted,</br>Because the pleasure of the woods he boasted,</br>And Latian mountes.  Then Picus thus againe</br>Sharply rebukte his sonne, but all in vaine,</br>Thou art no souldier for Dianaes garison,</br>Nor twixt her Nymphes and Faunus is comparison:</br>Nymphes are like Poets, full of wit, but poore,</br>Unto thy kingdome, adde a kingdome more</br>By marriage:  let Pycus counsel thee,</br>Looke not (my boy) at wit, and Poetrie.</br>Faunus no reckning of such counsell makes,</br>(Light is that love which any counsell takes)</br>Then like Hermocrates the Phisitian,</br>Seeing his patient with an incision</br>Sore vext, in steede of ministring to the sore,</br>Began to chide, bade him be sicke no more.</br>Or like a friend, that visiting his friend</br>Loaden with fetters in darke prison pend,</br>With unkind words, and bitter termes doth move him,</br>To leave those fetters, or he would not love him:</br>This other way from love would Pycus reave him,</br>And bade him leave to love, or love to leave him:</br>Or if such love made Love not to regard him,</br>His love would love, with hatred to reward him.</br>Remember love, and Pycus would the rather,</br>Forget his sonne, he should forgoe his father.</br>Love all this while on Faunus ey-balls stood,</br>Whose Envie, palenesse, Anger, caused blood</br>In Faunus cheekes, to heare such blasphemie</br>Pronounc'd by Pycus gainst his deitie.</br>With that he leapes from Faunus face and flies</br>Unto the seld-prevented Destinies.", "He found them busie at a Parliament,</br>Under their feete relentlesse Adamant,</br>Above their heads the marble was for teele,</br>The ribs of yron, and the raftrie steele,</br>The walls of flint, and brazen was the gate,</br>And every one upon a wooll-packe sate.</br>Whose sterne austere lookes never mov'de to ruth,</br>By gold, nor favour, beauty, age nor youth:</br>Yet when love came (what hearts though made of stone,</br>In which Love cannot make impression?)</br>Welcome he was, Love then his speech began,</br>To shew th' unmanlike crueltie of man,</br>How Nature first ordaining one for one,</br>Made woman chiefe for procreation:</br>But men like drudges, not content to use them,</br>In blows (sometimes) and speeches will abuse them,</br>Love's will was this, that maides should have their will,</br>Not overmuch, but to restraine from ill.</br>Ill kept-in-thoughts, with vertuous companie,</br>Restraining not from well-rulde libertie.</br>For maides were made to make such harmlesse plaies,</br>Such honest sports, as daunce upon the laies:</br>The hey-de-guise, and run the wild-goose chace,</br>And trie the keeles the Farlibreake, and base,</br>But with a barly when the pastimes end,</br>And maides must needes for milking homewards wend:</br>As some depart, some are constraind to stay,</br>For when they end, then Love begins to play,</br>His play is paine, but yet a paine with ease,</br>His keeles are coales, whose fire doth grieve and please,</br>From play (for pray) Love takes two loving freeres,</br>Traind up alike, perhaps of equall yeeres,</br>Yet such is love of parents such begot,</br>That wealth, nor worth, true love considers not.</br>Sometime a King dotes on a countrie swaine,</br>Sometime a Lady loves a lad againe:</br>Sometime the meaner will the greatst reject,</br>No not a person Love will once respect.</br>And having pearc'd the soule's seven-doubled shield,</br>Love makes the one unto the other yeeld.</br>They yeeld (kind soules) but parents will not grant,</br>With tedious brawlings still they finde a want,</br>One is too rich, the other is too poore,</br>(So then twixt Faunus and faire Melliflore,</br>Love told the Love,) and fearing fathers ire,</br>Love is defeated of his chiefe desire.</br>This kind unkindnesse children yet must take,</br>Untill their parents price of them do make,</br>As in a market:  then what man wil crave them,</br>And give the most, he shalbe sure to have them.</br>Thus from Loves mouth the honnie as he spoke</br>Distild, as from the brode-leav'd builder oake,</br>And opall pearle from his lippes did fall,</br>The Destinies began to gather all.</br>Such pretious jewells, if they fell but neare them,</br>And prowd of such love-tokens yet do weare them,</br>His sugred tale thus sweetned by his mouth,</br>The Destinies did somewhat pittie youth:</br>With one consent and voice they all agreed,</br>These statutes should for ever be decreed:</br>That man for his unmanlike treacherie</br>Should be tormented with vile jealousie,</br>That maids from honest libertie restrained,</br>Should alway thinke from what they thus refrained:</br>That twas some treasure from the which th' are tide,</br>Some Indian jewell which men use to hide,</br>Some strange conserve, sweete, deare, and pretious,</br>And women are by nature licorous.</br>These thoughtes awaked, women growe manwood,</br>Nor can these thoughts from actions be withstood.</br>What bird is pleasde, though in a silver cage?</br>A dogge tide up in golden chaines will rage.</br>That market marriages evermore should be</br>Content the best, the worst to disagree,</br>That shrewdnesse should possesse the womans heart,</br>In stubbornnesse the husband act his part:</br>Thus drawing opposite in one yoke, alive</br>Long might they live, but they should never thrive:</br>And since that time, all marriages enforced,</br>Never agree untill they be devorced.</br>This sentence given, Love then backe returned,</br>To lovely Faunus, who in Loves fire burned,</br>But ere he came, Faunus had turnd to hate,</br>His fathers speeches, and grew passionate,</br>Who in the night (the best meanes for desire)</br>Got up, and darklings, only his attire,</br>And naked beautie with a tresse of Amber,</br>Gave a resplendance to the purle-hung Chamber:</br>Sought for a suite, yet could not well devise,</br>What garment best might please his faire Nimphs eies:</br>If costly, then for woddy Nimphs too curious,</br>If gay or gawdie, that was but penurious:</br>This was too olde, the other was not new,</br>This the Tailer (Tailers will not be true)</br>Had cut too short, that hee might have a sharing,</br>A garment then hee tooke more rich then glaring,</br>Of gold beat Samite to his heeles which rought,</br>With knoppes and broches, birdes, and beasts, ywrought.</br>In tuffes of Cypresse hung the Topaze stone,</br>Which through the Cypresse (yet obscurely) shone:</br>As when wee see a thinne blacke cloudie clustre,</br>Through which the stars do yeeld a darksome lustre:</br>A gorgeous choller of deare chevasall,</br>Set with a white embrodered Pyronall,</br>And Margarites, with workmans rare devise,</br>It seemed like unto a shining Ice,</br>That night (adorned in this princely sort)</br>Faunus departed from his fathers Court,</br>And went, untill for wearines he was</br>Constrainde to lie downe on the yeelding grasse,</br>And recommended his faire bodies breath,</br>To Morpheus the elder borne of death.</br>There Faunus lie, and cease my pen to tell,</br>What paine those Nimphes abode for thy farewell:</br>How sops of sorrow drencht in cups of care,</br>In steede of Nectar and Ambrosia were:</br>Greefe great in all, yet great'st in Melliflore,</br>Who thought her Faunus murdred by the Bore:</br>She cut the trees, and carv'de the tender graffes,</br>With dolefull Sestines, mourning Epitaphes.</br>And stopt with sighs, and drownd in kisse-cheeke teares,</br>Her halfe-spoke words.  A garment now she weares</br>Right Raven-blacke, like sorrowes liverie,</br>Cut all in rags, yet joynde so cunningly,</br>As by her clothes poore raggednesse was braved,</br>And povertie no greater riches craved.</br>The Sun this morne before hee did appeare,</br>Got two houres journey in his Hemisphere.</br>And Melliflora at the Sunnes first peeping,</br>With loves sharpe-sighted eie the thickets creeping.</br>Under the broad head of a Pine-tree spies</br>Faunus asleepe, whose face to heavn-ward lies.</br>She shrunke aside, aside againe she started,</br>Thinking he had beene Adon, she departed:</br>But comes againe, (for love lept from his eies</br>And puld her backe) twas Faunus then she sees:</br>She knew and feared, feare she knew before,</br>Fearing he had beene murdered by the Bore,</br>She layd her eie-liddes to his eies and wept,</br>Then she perceivde her dearest Faunus slept.</br>With that she joynd her corrall lips to his,</br>Sucking his breath, and stealing many a kisse:</br>Wishing the life of a Camelion,</br>That she might onely live his breath upon:</br>Which all unwilling his faire body left,</br>And would not from that paradise be reft.</br>Or heavenly mansion, which he did retaine,</br>But there in hope to be enclosde againe:</br>This soft sound sleepe to Melliflora gave leysure,</br>To see, to feele, to smell, to taste such pleasure,</br>As none but onely she could ever know;</br>And none but Faunus on the earth could show.</br>Oh for how oft (whilst love her marrow warmes)</br>Would she embrace twixt Alablaster armes,</br>And hugge, and cull the snow white fronted Boy,</br>Call him her love, her life, her soule, her joy?</br>Then pry more nearely on his necke, with oft</br>Quicke moving lookes, and with her fingers soft</br>Dimple his breast, and hanging ore his shoulder,</br>Hold Faunus downe (thrise blest with such an holder.)</br>And then againe, though yet he sleeping is,</br>Thus she beganne to woe him for a kisse.", "More gratious farre then dawning of the day,</br>Then Venus starre, or purple coloured Maie:</br>Let not my begging dearest Faunus grieve thee,</br>Upon a note ten thousand kisses give mee:</br>And then as many busles overplus,</br>As Cinthia gave her love Propertius.</br>How many Cupids with the Graces trippe</br>Upon thy left cheeke, and thine upper lippe?</br>How many lifes, deaths, joyes, hopes, cares, and feares,</br>Thy quicker moving eie-balles Faunus beares:</br>So many collings, with kind clippings give mee,</br>As Cupids golden headed arrowes grieve me:</br>And adde enticements twixt thine amorous kisses,</br>And pleasant murmures with sweete sounding hisses.</br>As Doves by turnes be either other nibbing,</br>And lovingly in blither words be snibbing:</br>And bloudlesse in my bosome when thou lies,</br>And I turne up my watrie swimming eies:</br>Then will I glew thee in my limber arme,</br>If cold as lead, my breast shall make thee warme;</br>And Melliflora with her kisses breath,</br>Shall give her Faunus life in lookt-for death:</br>Untill my spirit in dewie kisses altring,</br>Within my body faint and fall a faultring.</br>Then take me Faunus twixt thy naked armes,</br>And use thy hugging and thy kissing charmes:</br>And in thy hearts spoone coll me least I perish,</br>As twixt thy breasts my frozen bloud ile cherish:</br>And then, like mine, thy moistie kisses dew,</br>At poynt of death life will againe renew:</br>Thus shall we enjoy the heaven of our age,</br>And both together both our lives will swage.</br>This said, she gathered fragrant smelling posies,</br>And strewd him o're with violets and roses:</br>Then with a kisse faine would she him have raised,</br>Yet stood stone still, and wishly on him gazed:</br>And forth his sleepe, as though she feard to feare him,</br>She fixt her kisses to the roses neare him.</br>The roses warme by Mellifloraes mouth,</br>A whispering gale of wind came West by South,</br>How many roses then before she kist,</br>(If she had knowne this, none she would have mist:)</br>Her former kisses kisses gainde such plentie,</br>That she receiv'de for one kisse more then twentie.</br>Such store of kisses on the sodaine found,</br>Some (slipping from her) fell upon the ground,</br>That such an harvest came upon the earth,</br>As since, we had of kisses never dearth.</br>But stirring once, his pillow made of grasse.</br>Faunus awakt, and Venus thought she was:</br>With that he rose, and like the blushing morne,</br>Having all night the loathsome burden borne</br>Of aged Tython (old men do no good,</br>Yet will be fumbling) angrie then and wood:</br>Among the clowdes herselfe shee headlong throwes,</br>To meete with Phoebus, what they do, all knowes:</br>Headlong he ran, such gamesome love he scorned,</br>As Venus lov'd, to have his love suborned.</br>But Melliflora ranne and overtooke him,</br>And held him hard, and never once forsooke him,</br>Until his name was honour'd by her tongue:</br>As one that findes great treasure standeth long,</br>Doubting hee sleepes, so stood the lovely boy,</br>Love-sicke, amaz'd, and surfeited with joy.</br>But when he knew her, O what amorous greeting:</br>Faunus devisde to entertaine his sweeting</br>Like to the elme enclaspt with wanton vine,</br>Or as the ivie doth the oake combine,</br>About her necke his ivorie armes did twine,</br>Faint, feeble, weake, and languishing:  in fine,</br>A moystie kisse seald up their lippes, as never</br>Injurious death should their embracements fever,</br>But with their kisses make two bodies one,</br>And so their hearts with kisses live alone:</br>Some teares betwixt them (teares of joy againe)</br>Did fall like silver drops in sun-shine raine:</br>Then Faunus told her how he scapt the bore,</br>And both related th' accidents before:</br>His ey-browes touch her roundie speaking eyne,</br>Kissing her necke and lippes like Corraline:</br>Then busseth she his cheeke, his chin, and brow,</br>Red, comely-short, and like to Cupids bow:</br>Yet in this union thus displeasde they be,</br>Because themselves they kissing cannot see:</br>Then like two culvers once againe they cleave,</br>Hugge, cull, and clippe, and sory for to leave.</br>She carries kisses on her doubtfull eies,</br>In those two Diamonds prettie babes he spies:</br>Untill they smile, which as the sunne doth chace,</br>The mist-hung clowdes then shewes his cheerefull face,</br>From eies, and cheekes, did drive away the teares,</br>The sighes, the sobs, the cares and doubtfull feares.</br>Faunus resolv'd now had intention,</br>To wooe (how love refines invention)</br>And thus he courted:  Faunus thus begunne</br>To wooe a Nymph, who was already wonne.", "Sweete namelesse Saint, (no name can
