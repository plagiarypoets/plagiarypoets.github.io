["Hence, gloomy Spleen, and sullen Care,</br>Of black stol'd Night and horrid Hydra born!</br>That lead the fret forlorn</br>All thro' the rueful regions of Despair.</br>Hence to the dark and dire abode,</br>Where Folly mourns in Superstition's chain,</br>And Priests, devoutly vain,</br>Forsake each virtue to adore their God.</br>Nor yet, ye deep immured cells,</br>Nor yet, ye dim glooms, ought have ye to please,</br>Where oft the mind's disease,</br>Beating her lorn breast, Melancholy, dwells.", "Far from these I fly to thee,</br>Blithe-ey'd nymph, Society!</br>In thy dwelling, free and fair,</br>Converse smooths the brow of Care,</br>Who, when waggish Wit betray'd</br>To his arms a silvan maid,</br>All beneath a myrtle tree,</br>In some vale of Arcady,</br>Sprung, I ween, from such embrace,</br>The lovely contrast in her face.</br>Perchance the Muses, as they stray'd</br>Seeking other spring, or shade,</br>On the sweet child cast an eye,</br>In some vale of Arcady,</br>And, blithest of the Sisters three,</br>Gave her to Euphrosyne.</br>The Grace, delighted, taught her care,</br>The cordial smile, the placid air;</br>How to chase, and how restrain</br>All the fleet ideal train.</br>How with apt words, well combin'd,</br>To shew each image of the mind:</br>Taught her how they disagree,</br>Aukward fear, and modesty,</br>And freedom and rusticity;</br>True politeness when to know</br>From the superficial shew,</br>From the coxcomb's shallow grace,</br>And the many-modell'd face;</br>That nature's unaffected ease</br>More than study'd forms would please;</br>When to check the sportive vein,</br>When to fancy give the rein;</br>On the subject when to be</br>Grave or gay, reserv'd or free;</br>The speaking air, th' impassion'd eye,</br>The living soul of symmetry,</br>And that soft sympathy that binds</br>In hidden chains congenial minds.", "Memory, mother of the Nine,</br>Led her oft to Learning's shrine;</br>And taught her from the treasur'd page</br>To cull the flowers of ev'ry age.</br>Come, gentle herald of the heart!</br>Fraught with every pleasing art,</br>On Hackthorn's silent shades a while</br>Sweet Queen of parley!  deign to smile;</br>For thee an hour I well could spare,</br>Stol'n from solitude and care.</br>"]
