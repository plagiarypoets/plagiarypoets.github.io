["The bosom of earth is all matted with leaves,</br>The honours of Autumn decay;</br>Brown Ceres no longer exhibits her sheaves</br>To the golden ey'd monarch of day.</br>With dissonant guns, hills and vallies resound,</br>The swains thro' the coppices rove;</br>The partridges bleed on the arable ground,</br>The pheasants lie dead in the grove.", "The coats of the hedges look languidly green,</br>The swallows relinquish the meads,</br>Rude winter approaches with horrible mien,</br>The flowers give place to the weeds.</br>The sun too is lazy, and slumbers a bed,</br>As loathing so early to rise:</br>When risen, how dim looks his vapoury head!</br>How faint he illumines the skies!", "No more on the poles hang the clustering hops,</br>Or form a magnificent shade;</br>No more on their skirts shine the showery drops,</br>For Autumn, their nurse, is decay'd.</br>The gale, that was wont to approach me so kind,</br>Grows sharp, and flies hastily by,</br>To give me sweet kisses no longer inclin'd,</br>It bids the tear start from my eye.", "O see, while I speak, from the gun's level'd aim</br>Death pierces the birds of the air!</br>Ye rovers!  will nothing your conduct reclaim,</br>And move your hard bosoms to spare?</br>No, nothing &mdash; ye cry with unanimous voice,</br>While ridicule falls from your tongue,</br>Ye think not, ye cruel ones, as ye rejoice,</br>How once the poor innocents sung!", "To others such barbarous sports I resign,</br>And fly to my Florimel's arms;</br>Her sanctified love shall be totally mine;</br>For virtue adds force to her charms.</br>On the base of religion, my fair, may it rise!</br>To crown us with blessing 'twas giv'n,</br>To bid our souls mount from the earth to the skies,</br>And give us a foretaste of heav'n.</br>"]
