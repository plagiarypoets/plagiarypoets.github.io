["No airy dreams their simple fancies fir'd,</br>No thirst for wealth, nor panting after fame,</br>But truth divine sublimer hopes inspir'd,</br>And lured them onward to a nobler aim.", "From every cottage with the day arose</br>The hallowed voice of spirit-breathing prayer;</br>And artless anthems, at its peaceful close,</br>Like holy incense, charmed the evening air.", "Though they, each tome of human lore unknown,</br>The brilliant path of science never trod,</br>That sacred volume claimed their hearts alone,</br>Which points the way to glory and to God.", "Here they from truth's eternal fountain drew,</br>The pure and gladdening waters day by day;</br>Learned, since our days are evil, fleet and few,</br>To walk in wisdom's bright and peaceful way.", "In yon lone pile o'er which hath sternly passed</br>The heavy hand of all-destroying time,</br>Through whose low mouldering aisles now sighs the blast,</br>And round whose altars grass and ivy climb:", "They gladly thronged, their grateful hymns to raise,</br>Oft as the calm and holy Sabbath shone;</br>The mingled tribute of their prayers and praise,</br>In sweet communion rose before the throne.", "Here from those honoured lips which sacred fire</br>From Heaven's high chancery hath touched, they hear</br>Truths which their zeal inflame, their hopes inspire,</br>Give wings to faith, and check affliction's tear.", "When life flowed by, and, like an angel, Death</br>Came to release them to the world on high,</br>Praise trembled still on each expiring breath,</br>And holy triumph beamed from every eye.", "Then gentle hands their \"dust to dust\" consign,</br>With quiet tears the simple rites are said,</br>And here they sleep, till at the trump divine,</br>The earth and ocean render up their dead.</br>"]
