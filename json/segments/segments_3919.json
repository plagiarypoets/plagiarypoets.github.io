["The mighty OAK, now level'd low,</br>The victim of the axe's blow;</br>(Great Metamorphosis of ART,</br>Chang'd by a tool in whole and part;</br>Thus forests turn to fleets on ocean,</br>And trees, as carts, are set in motion;)</br>The Cutters now their work survey,</br>And join to bear the spoils away;</br>The burthen on their shoulders bore,</br>And sought the nearest river's shore;</br>With ease the weighty load they move,</br>For ev'ry man with vigour strove;</br>Just at the goal, a selfish fool,</br>Averse to wisdom's wholesome rule,</br>His shoulders from the burthen drew,</br>His private ends alone in view;</br>Another knave, and still another,</br>Withdrew his shoulder like his brother;</br>The honest few still kept their post,</br>Till weight and strength the balance lost;</br>And while with zeal they forward push'd,</br>Down fell the wood, and all were crush'd.", "THE MORAL.</br>Learn from this tale, ye Miser knaves,</br>He gains a loss who Taxes saves;</br>The haughty Lord, who shuts out light,</br>And stops a window up in spite;</br>Who turns his servant's coat to 'scape</br>The tax upon a liv'ry cape;</br>Or, hates the Tax so wisely hit on,</br>To make a Beau a useful Briton;</br>By meanly saving things in small,</br>May bring down ruin on his all&mdash;</br>He most shou'd bear who most is able,</br>Or States will fall like Log in Fable.</br>"]
