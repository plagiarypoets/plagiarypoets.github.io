["Invoking the Genius of Song,</br>Amid the green wood-lands I rove;</br>And call my new fancies along</br>To paint the warm feelings of Love.</br>More charming than aught on the plains,</br>When Summer's new beauties appear;</br>O!  Phillis!  the best of my strains</br>Are tun'd for thy musical ear.", "Now, known for my pastoral note,</br>I rank with the Sons of the Muse;</br>On plains and in valleys remote,</br>Applause my new carol pursues:</br>And whilst, by the shepherds admir'd,</br>The song or the sentiment warms;</br>'Tis, all by thy beauties inspir'd,</br>The tribute I owe to thy charms.", "More cold than the snows of the pole;</br>More lovely than mornings in May;</br>Thou, Phillis, dear nymph of my soul,</br>Art flown from thy lover away:</br>And here, in dejection, I mourn;</br>No joys to my bosom are known;</br>But, grieving, I wait thy return,</br>And wander in thickets alone.", "Now Spring, ever dear to my heart,</br>Has mantled the meadows and groves;</br>And, quitting the mansions of Art,</br>I dwell in these woodbine alcoves.</br>But long is my comfortless hour;</br>Dark mazes of anguish I trace;</br>My charmer is not in the bow'r;</br>She flies from her Colin's embrace.", "Thou, Lark, that, forsaking the lawn,</br>With song art ascending the skies;</br>Go meet the sweet fulgence of dawn,</br>Attend it wherever it flies:</br>Observe, where a beauty supreme,</br>Out-rivals all efforts of Art;</br>'Tis Phillis, for ever my theme;</br>'Tis Phillis, the nymph of my heart.", "Return, thou sweet minstrel of morn,</br>Proclaim to these woodlands around;</br>Where, treating new lovers with scorn,</br>May Phillis, my fair one, be found:</br>I dread neither mountain nor waste,</br>Nor storms that are throng'd in the sky;</br>But, speeding on pinions of haste,</br>I to my dear charmer will fly.", "'Tis dark, the gay birds are asleep,</br>And only the Nightingale wakes;</br>With her my sad vigils I keep;</br>With her I will mourn in the brakes:</br>Thou, soother of anguish extreme,</br>O, Sleep!  thy soft moment impart;</br>For, thou canst restore, in a dream,</br>My Phillis awhile to my heart.</br>"]
