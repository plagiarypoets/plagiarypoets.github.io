["Hope, thou great solace of the mind,</br>In all the ills of life's career;</br>Thro' thee, their weight we bear resign'd,</br>Thro' thee, we check the falling tear:</br>Each cloud obscure in brighter tints is dress'd,</br>And winter's storms more appall the aching breast.", "With tatter'd garb, and deep sunk eye,</br>(Her infants 'wailing at her knee)</br>See Want beneath a yew-tree lie,</br>Yet hoping, Heavenly Charity</br>With some poor mite her lingering hours will bless,</br>'Till life, pale inanition's fatal pow'rs suppress.", "Deep in the dungeon's darksome light,</br>Some victim to offended Heaven,</br>Moans thro' his last, and dreadful night,</br>Almost to desperation driven;</br>Yet royal mercy beams upon his eye,</br>And seems to give that life the outraged laws deny.", "Arise and walk: &mdash; The Saviour said,</br>When all around was deep despair&mdash;</br>The sick had faith &mdash; he took his bed,</br>And loud Hosannas rent the air.</br>Thy word alone can this disease controul,</br>Then grant, O gratious Lord, my faith may make her whole.</br>"]
