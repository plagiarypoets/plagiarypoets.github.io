["Hark!  the shrill trumpet calls to feats of ARMS,</br>Encount'ring legions darken all the plain;</br>From shore to shore resound the loud alarms,</br>The POW'R of BATTLES calls forth all his train.</br>Soft meek-ey'd PEACE from wild DISORDER flies;</br>And, leaving scenes of blood, ASTRAEA mounts the skies.", "Where ancient Danube rolls his swelling wave,</br>Where lofty AUSTRIA'S wide domains extend,</br>What mighty chiefs shall find a timeless grave,</br>Ere the dire contest of ambition end!</br>Yet glorious WAR!  the world's great lords proclaim,</br>WAR!  Glorious WAR!  resounds the trump of Fame!", "I know thee, WAR!  in all thy pomp array'd,</br>Thy banners waving o'er the tented field,</br>With \"all the glorious circumstance\" display'd,</br>That tempts to reap the harvest arms can yield:</br>The multitude thy pomp admiring views,</br>While HONOUR, mighty shade!  thy giant steps pursues.", "Rich is thy robe; full haughty is thy stride,</br>And oft' thy temples are with laurels bound;</br>But whence those gorgeous robes in crimson dy'd,</br>And whence thy brow with dazzling splendours crown'd?</br>Thy trappings cast aside, what view we there,</br>But horror, pain, and blood, and anguish, with despair?", "Else, why does yon fair mourner to the winds</br>Oft sigh in vain; in vain her love require;</br>While he his fate in hostile conflict finds?</br>Why does yon orphan mourn his slaughter'd sire?</br>Why? &mdash; But that angry Heav'n waves high the brand</br>Committed to thy charge, to plague each guilty land.", "But far remov'd from ALBION be thy reign;</br>Far from our country's Heaven-descended tow'rs:</br>Too much we know of THEE, and of thy train,</br>Thy wounds we felt! &mdash; Tranquility be ours!</br>Let PEACE her mildest influence here display,</br>And distant nations hail her happy sway!</br>"]
