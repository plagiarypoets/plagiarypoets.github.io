["These have been glorious, &mdash; are so still, and we,</br>Perchance, with other nations, may go down,</br>Though not unspotted, to posterity:</br>For Albion has high names, that give renown</br>To her, &mdash; unfading jewels to her crown,</br>That bore her glory o'er the wave afar;</br>The proudest nations trembled at their frown&mdash;</br>Gods of the ocean, thunderbolts of war,</br>From old Hispania's scourge to him of Trafalgar.", "Hampden, and Sydney, Raleigh, Spencer, Gower,</br>The mighty Magian and immortal pair,</br>Our own blind bard, of poesy the flow'r,</br>Gray, Butler, Erin's minstrel, minds that were</br>All matchless in their line, and who will bear</br>And bid her name to future ages bloom;</br>Thomson, M'Pherson, Ramsay, Burns, and Blair,</br>Robertson, Smollett, Beattie, Scott, and Hume,</br>With him to whom as yet his country gives no tomb.", "With others, equal in their lustre, whom</br>Our craving eyes would almost wish to see,</br>Bursting the dull cold fetters of their tomb,</br>Before us stand in all their majesty.</br>Fond, but vain wish, alas!  that ne'er can be!</br>Great as they were, their names alone remain</br>For us t' admire, and our posterity</br>To rev'rence, when from this world we are ta'en</br>To lay our fading dust, perchance, where their's has lain.</br>"]
