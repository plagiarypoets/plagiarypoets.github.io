["Come lovely gentle peace of mind</br>With all thy smiling nymphs around,</br>Content and innocence combin'd,</br>With wreath of sacred olive crown'd.", "Come thou, that lov'st to walk at eve,</br>The banks of murm'ring streams along,</br>That lov'st the crowded court to leave,</br>And hear the milk maid's simple song.", "That lov'st with contemplation's eye</br>The head-long cataract to view,</br>That foams and thunders from on high,</br>While echoes to the sound renew.", "That lov'st the dark sequester'd wood,</br>Where silence spreads her brooding wings,</br>Nor less the lake's translucent flood,</br>The mossy grotts and bubbling springs.", "With thee, the lamp of wisdom burns,</br>The guiding light to realms above!</br>With thee, the raptur'd mortal learns</br>The wonders of celestial love.", "With thee, the poor have endless wealth,</br>And sacred freedom glads the slave,</br>With thee!  the sick rejoice in health,</br>The weak are strong the fearful brave.", "O lovely gentle peace of mind</br>Be thou on earth my constant guest,</br>With thee, whate'er on earth I find,</br>The pledge of heav'n shall make me blest.</br>"]
