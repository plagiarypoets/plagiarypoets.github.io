["Beside the pleasant Mill of Trompington</br>I laughed with Chaucer; in the hawthorn shade</br>Heard him, while birds were warbling, tell his tales</br>Of amorous passion.  And that gentle Bard,</br>Chosen by the Muses for their Page of State&mdash;</br>Sweet Spenser, moving through his clouded heaven</br>With the moon's beauty and the moon's soft pace,</br>I called him Brother, Englishman, and Friend!</br>Yea, our blind Poet, who in his later day,</br>Stood almost single; uttering odious truth&mdash;</br>Darkness before, and danger's voice behind,</br>Soul awful &mdash; if the earth hath ever lodged</br>An awful soul &mdash; I seemed to see him here</br>Familiarly, and in his scholar's dress</br>Bounding before me, yet a stripling youth&mdash;</br>A boy, no better, with his rosy cheeks</br>Angelical, keen eye, courageous look,</br>And conscious step of purity and pride.", "[Book III, 1805; Maxwell (1971) 116]", "And Shepherds were the men that pleased me first;</br>Not such as, 'mid Arcadian fastnesses</br>Seqestered, handed down among themselves,</br>So ancient poets sing, the golden age;</br>Nor such, a second race, allied to these,</br>As Shakespeare in the wood of Arden placed</br>Where Phoebe sighed for the false Ganymede,</br>Or there where Florizel and Perdita</br>Together danced, Queen of the feast, and King;</br>Nor such as Spenser fabled. . . .</br>"]
