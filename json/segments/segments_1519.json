["I stood tip-toe upon a little hill,</br>The air was cooling, and so very still,</br>That the sweet buds which with a modest pride</br>Pull droopingly, in slanting curve aside,</br>Their scantly leaved, and finely tapering stems,</br>Had not yet lost those starry diadems</br>Caught from the early sobbing of the morn.</br>The clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn,</br>And fresh from the clear brook; sweetly they slept</br>On the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept</br>A little noiseless noise among the leaves,</br>Born of the very sigh that silence heaves:</br>For not the faintest motion could be seen</br>Of all the shades that slanted o'er the green.</br>There was wide wand'ring for the greediest eye,</br>To peer about upon variety;</br>Far round the horizon's crystal air to skim,</br>And trace the dwindled edgings of its brim;</br>To picture out the quaint, and curious bending</br>Of a fresh woodland alley, never ending;</br>Or by the bowery clefts, and leafy shelves,</br>Guess were the jaunty streams refresh themselves.</br>I gazed awhile, and felt as light, and free</br>As though the fanning wings of Mercury</br>Had played upon my heels:  I was light-hearted,</br>And many pleasures to my vision started;</br>So I straightway began to pluck a posey</br>Of luxuries bright, milky, soft and rosy.", "A bush of May flowers with the bees about them;</br>Ah, sure no tasteful nook would be without them;</br>And let a lush laburnum oversweep them,</br>And let long grass grow round the roots to keep them</br>Moist, cool and green; and shade the violets,</br>That they may bind the moss in leafy nets.", "A filbert hedge with wild briar overtwined,</br>And clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind</br>Upon their summer thrones; there too should be</br>The frequent chequer of a youngling tree,</br>That with a score of light green brethen shoots</br>From the quaint mossiness of aged roots:</br>Round which is heard a spring-head of clear waters</br>Babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters</br>The spreading blue bells:  it may haply mourn</br>That such fair clusters should be rudely torn</br>From their fresh beds, and scattered thoughtlessly</br>By infant hands, left on the path to die.", "Open afresh your round of starry folds,</br>Ye ardent marigolds!</br>Dry up the moisture from your golden lids,</br>For great Apollo bids</br>That in these days your praises should be sung</br>On many harps, which he has lately strung;</br>And when again your dewiness he kisses,</br>Tell him, I have you in my world of blisses:</br>So haply when I rove in some far vale,</br>His mighty voice may come upon the gale.", "Here are sweet peas, on tip-toe for a flight:</br>With wings of gentle flush o'er delicate white,</br>And taper fingers catching at all things,</br>To bind them all about with tiny rings.", "Linger awhile upon some bending planks</br>That lean against a streamlet's rushy banks,</br>And watch intently Nature's gentle doings:</br>They will be found softer than ring-dove's cooings.</br>How silent comes the water round that bend;</br>Not the minutest whisper does it send</br>To the o'erhanging sallows:  blades of grass</br>Slowly across the chequer'd shadows pass.</br>Why, you might read two sonnets, ere they reach</br>To where the hurrying freshnesses aye preach</br>A natural sermon o'er their pebbly beds;</br>Where swarms of minnows show their little heads,</br>Staying their wavy bodies 'gainst the streams,</br>To taste the luxury of sunny beams</br>Temper'd with coolness.  How they ever wrestle</br>With their own sweet delight, and ever nestle</br>Their silver bellies on the pebbly sand.</br>If you but scantily hold out the hand,</br>That very instant not one will remain;</br>But turn your eye, and they are there again.</br>The ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses,</br>And cool themselves among the em'rald tresses;</br>The while they cool themselves, they freshness give,</br>And moisture, that the bowery green may live:</br>So keeping up an interchange of favours,</br>Like good men in the truth of their behaviours</br>Sometimes goldfinches one by one will drop</br>From low hung branches; little space they stop;</br>But sip, and twitter, and their feathers sleek;</br>Then off at once, as in a wanton freak:</br>Or perhaps, to show their black, and golden wings,</br>Pausing upon their yellow flutterings.</br>Were I in such a place, I sure should pray</br>That nought less sweet, might call my thoughts away,</br>Than the soft rustle of a maiden's gown</br>Fanning away the dandelion's down;</br>Than the light music of her nimble toes</br>Patting against the sorrel as she goes.</br>How she would start, and blush, thus to be caught</br>Playing in all her innocence of thought.</br>O let me lead her gently o'er the brook,</br>Watch her half-smiling lips, and downward look;</br>O let me for one moment touch her wrist;</br>Let me one moment to her breathing list;</br>And as she leaves me may she often turn</br>Her fair eyes looking through her locks auburne.</br>What next?  A tuft of evening primroses,</br>O'er which the mind may hover till it dozes;</br>O'er which it well might take a pleasant sleep,</br>But that 'tis ever startled by the leap</br>Of buds into ripe flowers; or by the flitting</br>Of diverse moths, that aye their rest are quitting;</br>Or by the moon lifting her silver rim</br>Above a cloud, and with a gradual swim</br>Coming into the blue with all her light.</br>O Maker of sweet poets, dear delight</br>Of this fair world, and all its gentle livers;</br>Spangler of clouds, halo of crystal rivers,</br>Mingler with leaves, and dew and tumbling streams,</br>Closer of lovely eyes to lovely dream,</br>Lover of loneliness, and wandering,</br>Of upcast eye, and tender pondering!</br>Thee must I praise above all other glories</br>That smile us on to tell delightful stories.</br>For what has made the sage or poet write</br>But the fair paradise of Nature's light?</br>In the calm grandeur of a sober line,</br>We see the waving of the mountain pine;</br>And when a tale is beautifully staid,</br>We feel the safety of a hawthorn glade:</br>When it is moving on luxurious wings,</br>The soul is lost in pleasant smotherings:</br>Fair dewy roses brush against our faces,</br>And flowering laurels spring from diamond vases;</br>O'er head we see the jasmine and sweet briar,</br>And bloomy grapes laughing from green attire;</br>While at our feet, the voice of crystal bubbles</br>Charms us at once away from all our troubles:</br>So that we feel uplifted from the world,</br>Walking upon the white clouds wreath'd and curl'd.</br>So felt he, who first told, how Psyche went</br>On the smooth wind to realms of wonderment;</br>What Psyche felt, and Love, when their full lips</br>First touch'd; what amorous, and fondling nips</br>They gave each other's cheeks; with all their sighs,</br>And how they kist each other's tremulous eyes:</br>The silver lamp, &mdash; the ravishment, &mdash; the wonder&mdash;</br>The darkness, &mdash; loneliness, &mdash; the fearful thunder;</br>Their woes gone by, and both to heaven upflown,</br>To bow for gratitude before Jove's throne.</br>So did he feel, who pull'd the boughs aside,</br>That we might look into a forest wide,</br>To catch a glimpse of Fawns, and Dryades</br>Coming with softest rustle through the trees;</br>And garlands woven of flowers wild, and sweet,</br>Upheld on ivory wrists, or sporting feet:</br>Telling us how fair, trembling Syrinx fled</br>Arcadian Pan, with such a fearful dread.</br>Poor nymph, &mdash; poor Pan, &mdash; how he did weep to find,</br>Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind</br>Along the reedy stream; a half heard strain,</br>Full of sweet desolation &mdash; balmy pain.", "What first inspired a bard of old to sing</br>Narcissus pining o'er the untainted spring?</br>In some delicious ramble, he had found</br>A little space, with boughs all woven round;</br>And in the midst of all, a clearer pool</br>Than e'er reflected in its pleasant cool,</br>The blue sky here, and there, serenely peeping</br>Through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping.</br>And on the bank a lonely flower he spied,</br>A meek and forlorn flower, with naught of pride,</br>Drooping its beauty o'er the watery clearness,</br>To woo its own sad image into nearness:</br>Deaf to light Zephyrus it would not move;</br>But still would seem to droop, to pine, to love.</br>So while the Poet stood in this sweet spot,</br>Some fainter gleamings o'er his fancy shot;</br>Nor was it long ere he had told the tale</br>Of young Narcissus, and sad Echo's bale.", "Where had he been, from whose warm head out-flew</br>That sweetest of all songs, that ever new,</br>That aye refreshing, pure deliciousness,</br>Coming ever to bless</br>The wanderer by moonlight?  to him bringing</br>Shapes from the invisible world, unearthly singing</br>From out the middle air, from flowery nests,</br>And from the pillowy silkiness that rests</br>Full in the speculation of the stars.</br>Ah!  surely he had burst our mortal bars;</br>Into some wond'rous region he had gone,</br>To search for thee, divine Endymion!", "He was a Poet, sure a lover too,</br>Who stood on Latmus' top, what time there blew</br>Soft breezes from the myrtle vale below;</br>And brought in faintness solemn, sweet, and slow</br>A hymn from Dian's temple; while upswelling,</br>The incense went to her own starry dwelling.</br>But though her face was clear as infant's eyes,</br>Though she stood smiling o'er the sacrifice,</br>The Poet wept at her so piteous fate,</br>Wept that such beauty should be desolate:</br>So in fine wrath some golden sounds he won,</br>And gave meek Cynthia her Endymion.", "Queen of the wide air; thou most lovely queen</br>Of all the brightness that mine eyes have seen!</br>As thou exceedest all things in thy shine,</br>So every tale, does this sweet tale of thine.</br>O for three words of honey, that I might</br>Tell but one wonder of thy bridal night!", "Where distant ships do seem to show their keels,</br>Phoebus awhile delayed his mighty wheels,</br>And turned to smile upon thy bashful eyes,</br>Ere he his unseen pomp would solemnize.</br>The evening weather was so bright, and clear,</br>That men of health were of unusual cheer;</br>Stepping like Homer at the trumpet's call,</br>Or young Apollo on the pedestal:</br>And lovely women were as fair and warm,</br>As Venus looking sideways in alarm.</br>The breezes were ethereal, and pure,</br>And crept through half closed lattices to cure</br>The languid sick; it cool'd their fever'd sleep,</br>And soothed them into slumbers full and deep.</br>Soon they awoke clear eyed:  nor burnt with thirsting,</br>Nor with hot fingers, nor with temples bursting:</br>And springing up, they met the wond'ring sight</br>Of their dear friends, nigh foolish with delight;</br>Who feel their arms, and breasts, and kiss and stare,</br>And on their placid foreheads part the hair.</br>Young men, and maidens at each other gaz'd</br>With hands held back, and motionless, amaz'd</br>To see the brightness in each others' eyes;</br>And so they stood, fill'd with a sweet surprise,</br>Until their tongues were loos'd in poesy.</br>Therefore no lover did of anguish die:</br>But the soft numbers, in that moment spoken,</br>Made silken ties, that never may be broken.</br>Cynthia!  I cannot tell the greater blisses,</br>That follow'd thine, and thy dear shepherd's kisses:</br>Was there a Poet born? &mdash; but now no more,</br>My wand'ring spirit must no further soar.&mdash;</br>"]
