["Ah!  whither, ye joys of pure May,</br>Too soon are your blessings withdrawn?</br>Or Phoebus, thy life-giving ray,</br>To barbarous climates is flown?</br>No more your soft influence cheers</br>Creation's enamel'd champains;</br>Swift fly thus, O man!  thy vain years,</br>Which labour nor patience regains.", "No longer high-perch'd on the spray,</br>The gay flutt'ring linnet conspires</br>To sooth, with his sonorous lay,</br>The sylvan throng's innocent fires:</br>The red-breast, whose song on the bough,</br>Betray'd a heart falsely secure,</br>Descends for his sustenance now</br>To peck at the cottager's door.", "Whilst blust'ring October begins</br>The prelude of winter to sound,</br>And fierce-raging Aeolus wins</br>Dominion o'er Thetis' profound:</br>Thy beauties, Pomona, are fled,</br>And with them hot summer's remains;</br>Ye forrests, why shake your tall heads,</br>To russet the withering plains?", "No more to the clear purling brook</br>The blythe panting shepherds repair;</br>No more, in the woodbine bow'r, look</br>With extacy on the gay fair.</br>Those scenes of delight, as a tale</br>Unfinish'd, too hasty are gone;</br>Now desolate horrors prevail,</br>And each young enjoyment is flown.", "Thus measure your time, ye vain tribe,</br>That reason's dominion can boast;</br>Whose life narrow bounds circumscribe,</br>And quick the fair vision is lost.</br>Whilst blest in the sun-shine of May,</br>Your infancy smoothly glides on,</br>And revels in innocent play,</br>When lo!  the sweet season is gone.", "Exulting beneath the hot beams,</br>Of manhood, your summer arrives;</br>What's past a delusion but seems,</br>Nor pleasure nor torment it gives.</br>Lo!  form'd by the warmth of wild youth,</br>Fond schemes to maturity rise,</br>Beguiling with mask of fair truth</br>With flattering prospects your eyes.", "'Till soon the thin veil is withdrawn,</br>And sober clad autumn appears;</br>The visions of summer are flown,</br>And manhood quick fades into years.</br>The mind now, with vigour replete,</br>Exerts its best reasoning pow'rs:</br>Now use the blest season, whilst yet</br>The season of autumn is yours.", "For lo!  as the glad minutes roll,</br>In tempests tremendous array'd,</br>Grim winter, sure lagging and foul,</br>Comes stalking with horrible head.</br>Then let not his terrible pow'r</br>A wretch in dull indolence drown'd</br>Arrest, and of vengeance secure,</br>Drag down to the dreadful profound.", "O happy!  twice happy!  are they</br>Whose infancy glides up to years,</br>When youth's to no passion a prey,</br>Then age without terror appears:</br>The silver-hair'd head can rejoice,</br>And wrinkles break forth with a smile</br>To him who, O conscience!  thy voice</br>Still follows, nor harbours a guile.", "Thus blest in fond innocence, once</br>With Mira young Florimont rov'd;</br>Endued with each blessing of sense,</br>Whose youth fond ambition ne'er mov'd:</br>Now friendship's mild influence grows;</br>A nearer affection they prove;</br>Each breast with pure sympathy glows,</br>And friendship is ripen'd to love.", "United by nature's first ties,</br>Their season of summer now rolls;</br>To them Hymen yielded the joys,</br>Fit only for heaven born souls.</br>To them autumn wears a blythe face,</br>And winter can ne'er bring dismay;</br>They view, in the spring of their race,</br>New mortals as happy as they.", "And now but one wish can they find</br>Together to yield up their breath:</br>At once to this duty consign'd</br>To smile 'midst the horrors of death.</br>Whilst living one truth, they still preach,</br>To lead erring mortals to right:</br>\"That none can this happiness reach,</br>But where love and friendship unite.\"</br>"]
