["The Summer was over, my Flocks were all shorn,</br>My Meadows were mow'd, and I'd hous'd all my Corn,</br>Fair Phillida's Cottage was just in my View,</br>A wooing I went &mdash; I had nought else to do.</br>On Flora's soft Sopha together we sat,</br>And spent some long Hours in amorous Chat;</br>I told her I lov'd her, and I hop'd she lov'd too,</br>Then kiss'd her sweet Lips &mdash; I had nought else to do.", "She hung down her Head and with Blushes reply'd</br>I'll love you, but first you must make me a Bride;</br>Without Hesitation I made her a Vow</br>To make her my Wife &mdash; I had not else to do.</br>To the Village in Quest of a Priest did we roam,</br>By Fortune's Decree the grave Don was at home;</br>I gave him a Fee to make one of us two,</br>He married us then &mdash; he had nought else to do.", "E'er since we've been happy, with Peace and Content,</br>Nor tasted the Sorrows of those who repent;</br>Our Neighbours all round us we love, and 'tis true</br>Each other beside! &mdash; when we've nought else to do.</br>With Phoebus the Toil of the Day we begin,</br>I Shepherd my Flock, while she sits down to spin;</br>Our Cares thus domestic we'll arduous pursue,</br>And ever will love &mdash; when we've nought else to do.</br>"]
