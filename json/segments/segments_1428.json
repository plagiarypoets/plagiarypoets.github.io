["A Traveller on the skirt of Sarum's Plain</br>O'ertook an aged Man with feet half bare;</br>Propp'd on a trembling staff he crept with pain,</br>His legs from slow disease distended were;</br>His temples just betrayed their silver hair</br>Beneath a kerchief's edge, that wrapp'd his head</br>To fence from off his face the breathing air.</br>Stuck miserably o'er with patch and shred</br>His ragged coat scarce showed the Soldier's faded red.", "\"And dost thou hope across the Plain to trail</br>That frame o'ercome with years and malady,</br>Those feet that scarcely can outcrawl the snail,</br>These withered arms of thine, that faltering knee?</br>Come, I am strong and stout, come lean on me.\"</br>The old man's eyes a wintry lustre dart,</br>And so sustained he faced the open lea.</br>But short the joy that touched his melting heart,</br>For ere a mile be gone his friend and he must part.", "Nor of long absence failed he soon to tell</br>And how he with the Soldier's life had striven</br>And Soldier's wrongs; but one who knew him well</br>A house to his old age had lately given.</br>Thence he had limp'd to meet a daughter driven</br>By circumstance which did all faith exceed</br>From every stay but him:  his heart was riven</br>At the bare thought:  the creature that had need</br>Of any aid from him most wretched was indeed.</br>"]
