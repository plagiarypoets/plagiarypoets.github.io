["Can the bosom of Laura be cold,</br>Can she falsely abandon her friend?</br>Can the love she so oft did unfold,</br>Oh can it, be now at an end?", "Fair truth seem'd to beam from her eye,</br>Sensibility glow'd on her cheek;</br>And she left me, methought, with a sigh;</br>&mdash;But perhaps it was all a mistake.", "Perhaps she but feign'd to bestow</br>That praise she so sweetly could give:</br>Perhaps &mdash; but it cannot be so,</br>For my Laura could never deceive.", "Oh ease my fond heart of its pain,</br>Convince me you still can be true:</br>The delightful assurance again,</br>With engaging persuasion renew.</br>"]
