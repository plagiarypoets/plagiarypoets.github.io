["When I was a young man I long'd</br>To know what the world was a doing,</br>To London with others I throng'd,</br>Nor knew well what I was pursuing.</br>But, good lack-a-day, what a din!</br>I through the croud scarcely could bustle:</br>In every place I was in,</br>To pass the folks I had a tustle.", "But what I did mostly admire,</br>Was the busy air of each creature;</br>Which seem'd so their thoughts to inspire,</br>Dull care was imprest in each feature.</br>In highest and lowest degree,</br>Odzookers!  in every station,</br>They all Politicians would be,</br>And govern and settle the nation.", "I found it a folly to roam,</br>Such hurry and bustle was teazing:</br>The joys I had tasted at home,</br>A thousand times sure were more pleasing.</br>So back to our hamlet I came,</br>And entered in Hymen's soft fetters,</br>With Dolly, my fond loving dame,</br>And left care and strife to my betters.</br>"]
