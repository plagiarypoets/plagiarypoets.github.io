["Seems life to thee, in future prospect long?&mdash;</br>In fancy dazzling, or fruition sweet?&mdash;</br>And wilt thou listen to a syren's song?&mdash;</br>Though heaven and earth in unison repeat</br>Life is the flower of grass, &mdash; a vision false and fleet.", "Oh thou whose heart, even while it dictates, glows</br>Too much attach'd to this insidious cheat,</br>How few the measured hours that interpose</br>Between thy wanderings, and thy last retreat,&mdash;</br>Where Death's unsparing hand unveils each fair deceit.", "\"This year!\" &mdash; how slight the barrier that divides</br>Thee from those loved ones in their graves that lie,</br>Soon pale and breathless, mouldering at their sides,</br>Thy fears, thy follies, thy delights shall fly</br>Fleet as the treacherous cloud that dimm'd the summer sky.", "Hast thou no noxious passion to control</br>Before that hour approaches dark with shade?&mdash;</br>No morbid fear, &mdash; no sickness of the soul,&mdash;</br>No erring motive, &mdash; nor good deed delay'd,</br>For which thy peace with Him who pardoneth is not made?", "\"This year to die!\" &mdash; Why all the years of man</br>Since forfeit Eden heard his parting sigh,</br>All generations with their boasted span</br>Are as a point to His Omniscient Eye</br>Who knows nor day nor night, &mdash; but rules Eternity.</br>"]
