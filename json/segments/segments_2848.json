["How soft are the notes of the Spring!</br>What fragrance exhales from the grove;</br>Ye Birds, taught by you, I would sing,</br>And here I for ever could rove.", "Though its bottom is clear, yet the rill</br>Delights from the rock to descend;</br>So I, from Ambition's steep hill,</br>My days in the valley would end.", "The waves that so ruffl'd awhile,</br>Were, glitt'ring, dash'd in the sun,</br>On the bordering violets smile,</br>And kiss them, and murmuring run.", "Thus let me the splendour and strife</br>Of the rich and exalted forgo;</br>With beauty still sweeten my life,</br>And Love's gentle storm only know.", "What joy the Bee murmurs impart!</br>The Zephyrs that curl the blue waves,</br>Soft Whispers that steal to the heart,</br>And Echo that talks in the caves!", "Peace!  Babblers, or only repeat</br>The silver descent of the Springs;</br>Fond shepherds frame here no deceit&mdash;</br>But Scandal has numerous wings.", "I call'd you to witness, 'tis true,</br>The vows that to Phillis I swore;</br>Methinks still her blushes I view,</br>And, trembling, forgiveness implore.", "Her charms I will grave in my heart,</br>Her name upon every tree;</br>And sooner shall Love want a dart,</br>Than fickleness harbour with me.</br>"]
