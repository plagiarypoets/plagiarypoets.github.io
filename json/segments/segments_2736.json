["Reclin'd on the banks of the Tay,</br>All mournful a shepherd was laid,</br>When finish'd the toils of the day,</br>And  cool were each covert and shade.</br>His flock they were penn'd in the fold,</br>His crook it lay carelessly by;</br>And each moment in sorrow he told,</br>When thus he began with a sigh:", "\"Ye hills, and each woodland, and grove,</br>In summer's gay verdure array'd,</br>Sweet haunts of fair friendship and love,</br>Where with Corydon oft I have stray'd:</br>No more can you yield me delight;</br>No longer the landscape can please;</br>I love the dull silence of night,</br>And to sigh to the sighs of the breeze.", "\"For, alas!  the dear shepherd is gone,</br>Has fled from this valley so gay,</br>And has left, o'er the moorlands, alone</br>His lambkins to bleat and to stray.</br>'What anguish I felt at my heart,'</br>When the swains crouded round with concern;</br>I scarce could behold him depart:</br>'Twas friendship that taught me to mourn.", "\"Can you boast of a shepherd so fair,</br>So gentle, so modest, and kind;</br>His easy and elegant air,</br>And the graces that shone in his mind!</br>Ye songsters, that warble all day</br>The groves and the thickets among,</br>Could ye equal his musical lay,</br>Or the scenes of his pastoral song?", "\"'Twas his to unravel the page,</br>The source of wisdom to show;</br>To reprove, and yet sweetly engage,</br>While we listen'd, and learned to know.</br>By whom was not Corydon lov'd?</br>By whom were his strains not rever'd?</br>He spoke &mdash; and the passions were mov'd;</br>He taught &mdash; and with rapture we heard.", "\"Ah me!  how delightsome the plain,</br>Where his cot sweetly rose to the view!</br>The scene but increases my pain:</br>I have bid the dear shepherd adieu.</br>Along the green banks of the Tay,</br>Or the meadows, so pleasant before,</br>All lonely and weary I'll stray,</br>And my Corydon's ABSENCE deplore.\"</br>"]
