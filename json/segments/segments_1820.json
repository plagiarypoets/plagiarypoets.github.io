["Should some lone trav'ller, that delights in song,</br>Ask on what spot my lays I did recite,</br>From those who live these gloomy woods among,</br>Where neither hill nor dale rejoice the sight;", "Haply the Genius of the place may say&mdash;</br>\"'Twas here he sought in poesy relief,</br>And oft in mournful mood sigh'd out the day,</br>Or touch'd the lyre to simplest sounds of grief.", "\"But yet his pipe of rudest minstrelsy,</br>No heart to tender sympathy could move,</br>For here no breast e'er felt the extasy</br>Which those partake who Phoebus' favours prove.", "\"Along the road, near yon deserted grove,</br>Where scarce a footstep e'er imprints the green,</br>Musing, at early dawn, he lov'd to rove,</br>And ponder o'er the solitary scene.", "\"One morn I miss'd him in his custom'd walk,</br>His lyre, neglected, lay beneath a tree;</br>No more in secret did I hear him talk,</br>Nor at the grove, nor on the road was he.", "\"May each sweet Muse collect her scatter'd flow'rs,</br>To weave a vernal garland for his head,</br>With nightly visitations cheer his hours,</br>And smooth the rugged path he's doom'd to tread.\"</br>"]
