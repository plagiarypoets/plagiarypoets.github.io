["O thou so dear!  whose wand'ring star</br>Leaves sad maternal love to mourn,</br>Now chain'd to fierce Bellona's car,</br>Say, does no thought of home return?</br>Of me, beneath a sky so dark and drear,</br>Where fortune drives the storm, and sorrow clouds the year?", "But rising from the stroke of fate,</br>I seize the long neglected lyre;</br>Warm at my heart new hopes dilate,</br>For thee new wishes they inspire;</br>The sullen weeds of woe I cast away,</br>And sweep the sounding chords to hail thy natal day.", "Thy boyish years to manhood brought,</br>Bless'd be the harvest's happy time!</br>And O, may firm collected thought</br>With judgment mark thy ripen'd prime!</br>May fair desert, with smiling fortune, crown</br>Thy long succeeding years with honour and renown.", "If with obscurity to dwell</br>Be mine in unfrequented bow'rs,</br>While fancy tunes her airy shell,</br>While friendship gilds the quiet hours,</br>Content may well her peaceful calm impart,</br>And soft affections still twine round my throbbing heart.", "While thou, dear object of my care,</br>Must still the busy world explore,</br>May thou its smiles propitious share,</br>Till the gay pageant charms no more;</br>Then when existence verges to its close,</br>In friendship, filial love, and tranquil hope repose.</br>"]
