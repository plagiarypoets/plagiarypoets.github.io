["When the sweet briar hedges inclose,</br>And hawthorns incircle the vale,</br>Perfum'd with the scent of the rose,</br>And balmy wing'd breath of the gale;</br>Remote from the pert and the gay,</br>Unknown to the pride of the town,</br>Young Phillida loveth to stray</br>Where happiness villagers crown.", "When she heard first the songs of the grove,</br>The notes of the nightingale flow,</br>She swore that such raptures of love,</br>Such joys she could never forgo.</br>Now she leads up the dance on the green,</br>To the timbrel's melodious sound,</br>With so soft, so engaging a mein,</br>Her gesture waves magic around.", "The damsels in simple attire</br>Adore the bright nymph as their queen;</br>Each shepherd beholds with desire:</br>Such beauty sure never was seen.</br>The graces attend on her walk:</br>Her face is for ever a smile;</br>'Tis transport to hear her but talk;</br>A heaven of love is her style.", "By all the bright sweets of the plain,</br>By the bird that inhabits the grove,</br>She's promis'd that Colin's the swain,</br>The idol and god of her love.</br>My banks are adorned with flow'rs,</br>My fields cover'd over with green;</br>And see how they open their bow'rs</br>And branches to shadow their queen.</br>"]
