["The virgin, when soften'd by May,</br>Attends to the villager's vows:</br>The birds sweetly bill on the spray,</br>And poplars embrace with their boughs.</br>On Ida, bright Venus may reign,</br>Ador'd for her beauty above;</br>We shepherds that live on the plain,</br>Hail May, as the mother of love.", "From the west, as it wantonly blows,</br>Fond Zephir caresses the pine:</br>The bee steals a kiss from the rose,</br>And willows and woodbines entwine;</br>The pinks by the rivulet side,</br>That border the vernal alcove,</br>Bend downward to kiss the soft tide:</br>For May is the mother of love.", "May tinges the butterfly's wing;</br>He flutters in bridal array!</br>And if the larks and the linnets now sing,</br>Their music is taught them by May.</br>The stock-dove recluse with her mate,</br>Conceals her fond bliss in the grove;</br>And murmuring seems to repeat,</br>That May is the mother of love.", "The goddess will visit ye soon,</br>Ye virgins be sportive and gay!</br>Get your pipes, oh ye shepherds, in tune,</br>For music must welcome the May.</br>Would Damon have Phillis prove kind,</br>And all his keen anguish remove,</br>Let him tell a soft tale, and he'll find,</br>That May is the mother of love.</br>"]
