["Once more the Sire of Storms his cloudy tent</br>Has pitched upon our Northern hemisphere,</br>And, from his shadowy seat,</br>Forc'd Autumn to retire.", "The feeble race of flow'rs have breath'd their last,</br>And sad, and solemn, sounds the frequent knell</br>Of rural Beauty gone&mdash;</br>Of rural Pleasure lost!", "Invidious Hoar-frost, perching on the spray,</br>Where late the wood-lark sang his sweet farewell,</br>Pierces, with fatal sting,</br>The green leaf's tender nerve.", "Waving his ebon wand, the surly Pow'r</br>Calls forth from their dank cells the chilling train</br>Of foul unwholesome fogs,</br>And glooms of hideous hue.", "The curtain, that enclos'd Morn's rosy couch,</br>No more its gay embroider'd folds displays,</br>As from it she descends</br>To greet the rising Sun.", "Eve, like a Mourner, muffled in her weeds,</br>Beside the tomb of one she dearly lov'd,</br>Eyes the dull scene awhile&mdash;</br>Then, with a sigh, departs", "To light her chariot on its dreary way.</br>Night, now, needs all her lamps; save when the Moon</br>Pours from her silver urn</br>The radiant flood around.", "Faint Nature falls a prey to atrophy;</br>And all her living tribes seem sorrowful</br>Their common Parent, thus</br>Declining, to behold.", "But those, to whom the GOD, who governs all,</br>Gave intellectual light, to see and judge,</br>They know that, by and by,</br>Her health will be restor'd.", "They know that, by and by, the breath of Spring,</br>With renovated vigour, will inspire</br>Her faded form again,</br>And deck it with new charms.</br>"]
