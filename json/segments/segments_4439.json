["Now Flora the meadow arrays,</br>And streaks the wild vallies with green,</br>Thro' which the clear rivulet strays,</br>Reflecting the beautiful scene;</br>The mountain with silvery brow</br>No longer assaults the dim sky,</br>But throws off its mantle of snow,</br>And declares the sweet season is nigh.", "The birds that were wont from their nest,</br>Affrighted to peep at the dawn,</br>Perceive the bleak winds are at rest,</br>And, soaring, salute the bright morn:</br>The trees, late with icicles hung,</br>Now expand their green leaves, and look gay,</br>Beneath which my Delia has sung</br>In praise of the sweet summer's day.", "My sheep, that in cover remain'd,</br>Now frolic the fallows among;</br>Thy shepherd, whom winter restrain'd,</br>Now roams the lone forest along:</br>But, Delia, this season of love</br>Affords me no joy, no delight;</br>'Tis with thee all pleasures I prove,</br>For in thee the graces unite.", "The sun, so uncloudedly bright,</br>Illumes lovely nature in vain;</br>I love the pale region of night,</br>That indulges the heighth of my pain:</br>The nightingale then too laments</br>The loss of her innocent mate;</br>Of her folly and scorn she repents;</br>Repents, but, alas!  'tis too late.", "Oh, Delia!  tho' now in despair,</br>Thy Strephon behold yet sincere;</br>View his eyes dim, and faded by care,</br>And the bloom of his cheeks disappear;</br>Attend to thy vows then, my fair;</br>Hear the sorrows that love bid me sing,</br>To thy swain and contentment repair,</br>And add to the sweets of the spring.</br>"]
