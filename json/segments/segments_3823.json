["Now Phoebus hastening to his wavy bed,</br>The western sky bestreaks with liquid gold;</br>Comes twilight grey, in sober liv'ry clad,</br>While flocks are seen slow stepping to the fold.", "And while Sol hastes our hemisphere to leave,</br>The woodland choirs chaunt forth sweet tuneful strains,</br>Till, warned now by dewy-finger'd eve,</br>The concert closes &mdash; and deep silence reigns.", "Save where the bat on leathern pinions borne,</br>Shrieks, weakly-ey'd, at yon ray's glimm'ring glare;</br>Save where the beetle winds his sullen horn,</br>And drony wheels amid the murky air.", "Save where the ravens at night's solemn call</br>(High o'er yon wood whose foliage faintly stirs),</br>Wheel playful down the dark aerial hall,</br>And croaking light amid the gloomy firs.", "Save where yon team nods tinkling on the way,</br>Each various scene of dinsome labour's shut,</br>And the tann'd peasant at the close of day,</br>Now plods him weary to his homely hut.", "His children playing on the level green,</br>At his approach the fav'rite sport forbear,</br>Exulting shout, and, O delightful scene,</br>Run titt'ring, run to meet their parent dear!", "Steps he now in &mdash; with what delight he sees</br>His wife sweet-singing by a shining fire,</br>The lovely infant dandling on her knees,</br>That leaps to hail its late-returning sire.", "Now Hesperus his paly circlet shows,</br>Bespangle o'er the sky the starry train,</br>Lo!  here and there a gem gay-sparkling glows,</br>While onward Cynthia drives her silver wain.", "The jovial reapers in the misty vale,</br>Unmindful of the labour of the day,</br>All garrulous rehearse some pleasing tale,</br>While round this sheety lake I musing stray.", "Thrice hail, Contentment!  heav'n-descending fair!</br>Who kindly crown'st these lab'rer's toil with joy,</br>May I, like them, thy genial influence share,</br>And, while I live, a lightsome life enjoy.</br>"]
