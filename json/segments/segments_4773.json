["See, on yon cliff that lifts its hoary brow</br>High to the tempest which its pride assails,</br>A maiden sits, and pays her parting vow,</br>Nightly, to Him who o'er the storm prevails.</br>She thinks of that lone hour when, on the strand</br>Her William parted from his lovely Jane&mdash;</br>Of that last look, when, grasping her fair hand,</br>He bade adieu!  and hastened to the main.</br>Now sporting with the blast, her wakeful eyes</br>Watch every billow as it mounts to view,</br>And fond desire bids the hope arise,</br>That all her dreams of bliss may yet be true:</br>Poor, hapless one!  she dreams and hopes in vain</br>The youth for whom she sighs is by the pirate slain!", "Behold the miser at his evening board,</br>With haggard face and robes of filth bedeck'd;</br>His one desire is to increase his hoard;</br>To this he sacrifices health, respect:</br>And every comfort which in man is given</br>By bounteous Providence, to make him blest</br>Is from old Graball's habitation driven</br>By hellish usury, of life the pest:</br>He dies, and carries with him nought but clay;</br>Some spendthrift heirs his stores, and melts their rust away.", "View the gay coxcomb at the airy ball,</br>Where mirth and frolic bid him drown all care;</br>Here every moment he's at beauty's call&mdash;</br>His every accent seems a smile to wear.</br>For one short hour he revels in disguise;</br>Pursue him, in the next, in his retreat,</br>And there discover how his glory dies&mdash;</br>How all his honours lie beneath your feet;</br>For sure a garret has not much to please,</br>Nor can fell poverty the appetite appease.</br>"]
