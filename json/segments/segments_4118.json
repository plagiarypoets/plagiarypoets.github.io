["Let titled rhymers flatter titled knaves,</br>Or bow obsequious at the nod of Kings;</br>My Muse alike detests the cringing slaves;</br>The gold-inspir'd Bard and theme he sings:</br>Simplicity, like her's, is rarely found</br>Amidst the pamper'd crowds that regal state surround.", "'Ere gay Aurora streaks th' eastern sky,</br>Soon as the hours unbar the gates of day,</br>Shrill Chanticleer unseals Phylenor's eye,</br>True as the village-cock, and chides his stay;</br>His cot he leaves, and, as he moves along,</br>Whistles some jocund tune, or chaunts some rustic song.", "Whate'er is task, he speeds along the plain,</br>Health on his cheek, and pleasure in his eye;</br>With silent raptures, views the brow-ear'd grain,</br>Exulting in the thoughts of harvest nigh,</br>When his good dame, with all her ruddy train,</br>Attends his steps, and gleans the freely-scatter'd grain.", "Whate'er his labour at the noon-tide hour,</br>(For by his staff he measures time aright)</br>Phylenor hastens to some neighb'ring bower,</br>Urg'd by the call of craving appetite.</br>Oft have I seen the red-breast hopping there,</br>And with the gen'rous swain his scanty pittance share.", "On the green turf, deliberately plac'd,</br>His open'd budget yields her homely store;</br>Yields him a coarse, yet strengthening repast,</br>And, Nature satisfy'd, he craves no more.</br>A crystal draught, the gift of neighb'ring springs,</br>At once allays his thirst, and health and vigour brings.", "Full well, to till the fruitful glebe he knows;</br>In Autumn foremost of the reaping band;</br>Good Heavens!  what crops beneath his care have rose?</br>What harvests fell beneath his skilful hand?</br>In herbs his knowledge equall'd is by few;</br>He knows their names, and tells their sov'reign virtues too.", "The sturdy oaks, the Monarch of the wood,</br>The forest's beauty, or the mountain's pride,</br>Fell'd by his prowess, brave the foaming flood,</br>And o'er the raging billows proudly ride;</br>Waft ev'ry climate's produce to our shore,</br>And bid around the world Britannia's thunders roar.", "When all the labours of the day are o'er,</br>I've heard him, as he homeward bends his way,</br>Repeat a song he learn'd in days of yore;</br>Attend, ye swains, while I recite his lay.</br>Cease the plum'd choristers to hear his song,</br>Echo hills, groves, and vallies, as he plods along:", "\"How happy is the peasant's life,</br>And how unenvied too!</br>Remote from scenes of noise and strife,</br>His wants, his wishes few.", "\"Content with what his labour earns,</br>That brings him bread and health;</br>He pities those the world deems great,</br>The slaves to power or wealth.", "\"His share of blessings he receives,</br>From him who dwells on high;</br>Ah!  thus unenvied may I live,</br>And unlamented die.", "\"I ask no monumental stone;</br>Be flowers strew'd round my grave:</br>Light laid the green turf o'er my head;</br>No other boon I crave.", "\"When, from this long-impris'ning clay,</br>My happy spirit's fled;</br>Suffice it that the good folks say,</br>An honest man is dead.\"", "His offspring meet, and hail him at his cot,</br>Whose clay-built walls resist the whistling wind;</br>The task, the labours of the day, forgot,</br>And not a thought of future toils behind.</br>Now groans his table 'neath its smoking pile,</br>Smiles the good man, his dame and all his children smile.", "Oft do I spend, and those my happiest hours,</br>A winter's evening round his chearful fire,</br>Phylenor then exerts his mental powers,</br>And tells the tales transmitted by his sire:</br>His merry sire full often to be found</br>Amidst the festive laugh, and where the glass went round.", "Tells how great Marlbro' Albion's foes o'ercame,</br>How Eugene conquer'd, and how Tallard fled;</br>How Britain's sons acquir'd immortal fame,</br>And heap'd Germania's plains with mountains of the dead.</br>His sire these noble glorious victories shar'd,</br>And in the foremost rank unmatch'd atchievements dar'd.", "Perchance recounts the feats himself has done,</br>When beauty prompts him, or when glory fir'd:</br>How well he wrestled, and what prizes won;</br>Envy'd by whom, and by what nymphs admir'd:</br>Then shews the trophies of his greener years,</br>Adorn'd with which his cottage cleanly wall appears.", "Shews the lac'd beaver, yet in all its pride,</br>His vig'rous arm from doughty Moeris won:</br>The crabtree cudgel too, so often try'd,</br>With which so many parlous feats he'd done:</br>This peerless weapon oft has born away</br>The envy'd long-contested honours of the day.", "In social chat the ev'ning thus we spend,</br>Whilst nut-brown ale expands the good man's soul;</br>His offspring to the pleasing tales attend,</br>And willingly partake the full-crown'd bowl.</br>All happy to his smiles around him crow'd,</br>Till Morpheus' leaden wand their weary'd heads has bow'd.</br>I take my leave, Phylenor seeks repose,</br>And strength-repairing sleep her balmy sweets bestows.</br>"]
