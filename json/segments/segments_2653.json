["While songsters their rivers to praise do combine,</br>Their Arno's, their Banna's, their Tweed's, and their Dee's;</br>To the Nymphs of Honduras the task shall be mine,</br>To sing the more beautiful Banks of Balize.", "See the nymphs and the swains in their Dories are singing,</br>While echo the music resounds through the trees;</br>Observe how the fishes around them are springing,</br>Their joy to express in the River Balize.", "Here young alligators are playfully sporting,</br>Here tigers so nimble, and droves of warrees;</br>All frisking like lambkins, and wantonly courting,</br>Along the sweet banks of the River Balize.", "No proud marble domes upon these rural plains,</br>Nor mansions of grandeur the traveller sees;</br>But marks what a charming simplicity reigns</br>In the wood-cutter's hut on the Banks of Balize.", "Let those who delight in fine fish and fresh air,</br>Enjoy their own pleasures on Honduras' Quays;</br>More happy am I in attending the fair</br>On the banks of the smooth flowing River Balize.", "Ye Aldermen who on rich turtle would feast,</br>Or would wish to indulge on our fam'd Mannatees,</br>Leave the city awhile, then come hither, and taste</br>This delicate food on the Banks of Balize.", "The songs of Moskitoes shall lull you to sleep;</br>Songs sweet as the whisp'ring of winds thro' the trees;</br>While Doctors and Sand-flies their vigils do keep,</br>To suck your rich blood on the Banks of Balize.</br>"]
