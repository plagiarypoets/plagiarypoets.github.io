["Come, heav'nly thought, in calm devotion drest,</br>Hallow the sabbath of Jehovah's praise,</br>Pure, and by worldly passion unperplext,</br>Begirt with sanctity and christian grace,</br>Hymning hosannahs to creation's Lord,</br>By downcast mien of angels, reverenc'd and ador'd!", "Pride bending under reason's firm constraint</br>Bow lowly.  Father of what's holiest, best</br>Source of whatever borders on the saint,</br>Thyself in thy son's pattern best exprest;</br>Before whom virtue is not free from stains,</br>Wisdom is folly, human strength incompetence.", "My soul's best organs fail to reach thy height,</br>And thought extended can't that goodness scan,</br>That scorns iniquity with perfect hate,</br>Prompting virtue mark'd by man's disdain,</br>By scorn endur'd illustrating thy praise,</br>For thou her blots incurr'd in judgment shalt craze.", "Arm'd with such virtue, my lov'd Saviour brav'd</br>Each vilifying taunt of human dross,</br>Insulted by their scorn his virtues sav'd</br>By meritorious suff'ring of the cross;</br>Each stigma plants a jewel in his crown</br>Of glory, and decrees a pang to foes o'erthrown.</br>"]
