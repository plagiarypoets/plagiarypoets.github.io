["Pensive I lay, e'en from the dead of night,</br>Until the sun his daily course began,</br>Reflecting on the candle's wasting light,</br>And moraliz'd the fate of mortal man.", "White and unsully'd was that cotton wick,</br>When from the chandler first to me it came;</br>Behold how black!  the greasy drops how thick!</br>Such colour takes it from imparted flame.", "Such is the youth, of manners strict and pure,</br>Till led by vice he quits his reason's guide;</br>By flatt'ry drawn, he stoops to vice's lure,</br>And from the paths of reason wanders wide.", "His passions melt, his manly vigour faints,</br>Nor mourns he ought his former vigour gone,</br>For foul society his former morals taints,</br>And mother Douglas marks him for her own.", "The fool who sells is freedom for a smile,</br>Or for a ribband barters peace of mind,</br>Like wasting wicks just glimmers for a while,</br>Then dies in smoke, and leaves a stink behind.", "The many perils that ambition wait,</br>When soaring high, we still the lower fall,</br>Are but the SNUFFERS of expiring light,</br>And death's the grand EXTINGUISHER of all.</br>"]
