["Hast thou not left whereon to hang a rhyme?</br>Nothing whereby to fix thy early birth?</br>Plague on't!  thou wert a favourite with Time,</br>Yet his hard hand hath patted thee to earth!&mdash;</br>How thou once gave thy marble halls to mirth,</br>Where now the mean usurping nettle springs;</br>What bold War-Chiefs and Dames of lofty worth,</br>There hung their nights on pleasurable wings:</br>Ah me!  no music now &mdash; save when the bleak wind sings.", "Thy poor old sides are naked to the skin!</br>And what unseemly rents are gaping there!</br>Thy big proud head hath long since fallen in;</br>Yet they have clapt a modern mock'ry where</br>Thine own rose high to catch the purer air.</br>One lone weak branch of ivy to the blast</br>Flings ever and anon her limbs, all bare;</br>Like a poor Orphan to the world out cast,</br>Sighing aloud that each rude sweep may be her last.", "Where are thy clanging doors? &mdash; thy lofty towers?</br>Of bright blue waters where the ample sheet?&mdash;</br>Where are thy roomy parks, and cool dark bowers?</br>The enamell'd ground that flush'd around thy feet?</br>Fit place for Kings from bus'ness to retreat.</br>Are they all gone?  All melted to \"thin air?\"</br>Nought left but proof that Time and Ruin meet,</br>To make strange havoc in this world of care!</br>A skeleton behold &mdash; a wreck of things that were!", "To-day the Monarch nods beneath a crown,</br>A crown perchance with ages' wisdom fraught:</br>Look ye to-morrow &mdash; Well? &mdash; All crumbled down;</br>All into one most pigmy atom wrought!</br>Worth millions now &mdash; to-morrow not a thought.</br>It matters not with Time, whate'er we prize&mdash;</br>Whatever good, our mortal ties have caught&mdash;</br>Love, honour, friendship, glory, all are spies,</br>That, smiling, crush to death, our best, best sympathies!", "Farewell, old Ruin:  I shall think on thee,</br>I'll read thy lesson on life's dreary way:</br>Thou tell'st me plainly, that my path may flee,</br>Clean off that bears me gaily up to-day,</br>Leaving me stuck down deep in mire and clay;</br>\"Go to &mdash; be wise.\"  I will, and that in time,</br>Ere fades my taper to an ev'ning grey:&mdash;</br>Ere life's clear stream is weeded o'er with crime,</br>My thoughts, big clouds their steps, still Heavenward shall climb!</br>"]
