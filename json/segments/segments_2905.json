["To London town my steps I bent,</br>Where Truth must wear a front of brass,</br>To Westminster in haste I went,</br>For I'd a suit to urge, alas!</br>Then to my counsel learn'd I hied,</br>\"Wise sir, I have a suit,\" I cried;</br>\"Help me in forma pauperis to plead,\"</br>But ah!  for want of cash I found I could not speed.", "Among the crowd as I was press'd,</br>Whip from my head my hat was gone;</br>In the King's Bench, above the rest,</br>I saw a grave and portly Don:</br>Sure he I thought, won't take a fee,</br>So down I popp'd upon my knee;</br>\"O to my suit great magistrate give a heed!\"</br>Alas!  for want of cash, I found I could not speed.", "I saw the clerks set all arow,</br>Writing as fast as fast might be;</br>The crier, too, began to crow,</br>He call'd aloud, ('twas strange to me,)</br>\"O yes!  O yes!  O yes!\" he whines,</br>\"List to your names and save your fines!\"</br>I cannot tell what they might save indeed;</br>And here, for want of cash, I knew I could not speed.", "And now the Common Pleas I found,</br>Where one in silken coif look'd big;</br>I bow'd me to the very ground,</br>To his black cap and pompous wig:</br>I told him all my piteous case,</br>My neighbour's fraud, my own disgrace;</br>The devil a word did from his lips proceed!</br>He found I had no cash, and therefore could not speed.", "Then to the Rolls away I went,</br>'Midst learned clerks in Chancery;</br>I found them all on gain intent,</br>The deuce a one regarded me.</br>Down on my marrow-bones I fell,</br>And 'gan my hapless tale to tell;</br>\"Hold &mdash; first, good friend,\" they cry'd, \"we must be fee'd!\"</br>So here, for want of cash, I found I could not speed.</br>"]
