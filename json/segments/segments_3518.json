["The clock struck one &mdash; that awful hour</br>When mortals feel thy sov'reign pow'r,</br>O Morpheus, and each wretch below</br>Awhile forgets his daily woe,</br>Fast fetter'd in thy pleasing chains;</br>While universal silence reigns:</br>Save where the stretching Lacqueys yawn,</br>Impatient wishing for the dawn;</br>And curse their Lady and Quadrille,</br>Their source of plagues, their source of ill;</br>Or where the well-barr'd doors resound,</br>Disturb'd by watchmen's nightly round,</br>To tell what weather, how time goes,</br>And guard us both from fire and foes.</br>Or flush'd with Bourdeaux and Champagne,</br>The rake forth sallying with his train,</br>Big for the adventures of the night,</br>Undaunted meeets th' approaching fight,</br>Falls on, is drub'd, and runs away.", "Then 'twas, on Pillory hung forlorn</br>Jack-Boot (by day the public scorn)</br>From leathern lungs with deep-fetch'd groan</br>In plaintive strains began his moan:</br>\"What, tho' with strong ambition fir'd,</br>My breast to favour erst aspir'd,</br>While I the steps of power ascending,</br>The Courtiers to their idol bending,</br>I grew by daily, vile aspersion,</br>The public hatred and aversion.</br>But why this clamour and uproar,</br>For that which others did before?</br>For homage, reverence, adoration,</br>In ev'ry age, in ev'ry nation,</br>Were claim'd by the exalted station:</br>And shall each base-born son of rhime,</br>Swell ev'ry action into crime?</br>Set in a note-book ev'ry thought?</br>And with rank spleen and malice fraught,</br>Presume on characters to sport,</br>And brand the vices of the Court?</br>Your men of genius, and of wit,</br>Who Satires printed, Libels writ,</br>Shall not dire vengeance swift pursue?</br>I cannot bear the scribbling crew.&mdash;</br>Dear trusty Pill'ry, firm support</br>To Statesmen, and intrigues of Court!</br>Justice to thee alone belongs,</br>Redress my grievances and wrongs!\"", "The Pill'ry then from heart of oak</br>With conscious pride indignant spoke.", "\"First of the forest once I rank'd,</br>No firmer timber ever plank'd,</br>Of honest-hearted British growth,</br>True to my King and Country both;</br>A monument of wrath I stood,</br>To brand the knave, redress the good;</br>But, I must own, like faithless men</br>I've been perverted now and then.</br>What wonder? &mdash; if of old respected,</br>I have of late been too neglected,</br>For rare renown'd my front appears,</br>Distinguish'd with a pair of ears.</br>More seldom claims the mangled nose,</br>The surgeon's fee, I now suppose.</br>The noses now of first-rate knaves</br>Are carry'd with them to their graves,</br>And starting 'bove their coifs you meet</br>A length of ears in ev'ry street,</br>Which, were we but allow'd to sue,</br>The Devil and I could claim our due.</br>The Judge, and not the Culprit mounted,</br>Would be the greater justice counted.</br>But prithee, friend, what makes you sick?</br>You're sore, I fear, and therefore kick.</br>Heaven gives you pow'r above the rest,</br>Like heav'n then succour the distrest.</br>Humble the haughty pride of France,</br>Old England's glory still advance;</br>Her anchor'd ships to India send,</br>And commerce o'er the world extend.</br>Such glorious actions add a grace,</br>Which time, nor envy can deface.</br>But on ambition's tott'ring tower</br>Uprais'd, you thence exert your power,</br>To gratify your own desire,</br>And to no other end aspire;</br>Then your own coffers to enlarge,</br>Unfaithful to the public charge,</br>Forsake the steps old Patriots trod,</br>While flatt'rers tremble at your nod;</br>If then some honest son of rhime</br>Dares to reproach you with your crime,</br>Whose bosom warm'd in virtue's cause,</br>Dares to defend her ancient laws;</br>That calls for vengeance at his hand:</br>'Tis justice then, for, e'er abash'd,</br>Vice must be ridicul'd or lash'd.</br>'Tis justice then unsheathes her sword,</br>Nor spares the Peasant, nor the Lord.\"</br>"]
