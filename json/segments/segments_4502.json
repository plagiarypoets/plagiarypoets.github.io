["Collin, I see by thy new-taken Task,</br>Some sacred Fury hath enricht thy Brains,</br>That leads thy Muse in haughty Verse to mask,</br>And loath the Lays that 'long to lowly Swains.</br>That lifts thy Notes from Shepherds unto Kings,</br>So like the lively Lark that mounting sings.", "Thy lovely Rosalind seems now forlorn,</br>And all thy gentle flocks forgotten quight:</br>Thy changed Heart now holds thy Pipes in scorn,</br>Those pretty Pipes that did thy Mates delight;</br>Those trusty Mates, that loved thee so well,</br>Whom thou gav'st Mirth, as they gave thee the Bell.", "Yet as thou erst with thy sweet Roundelays,</br>Didst stir to glee our Lads in homely Bowers:</br>So moughtst thou now in these refined Lays,</br>Delight the dainty Ears of higher Powers.</br>And so mought they in their deep scanning Skill,</br>Allow and grace our Colin's flowing Quill.", "And fair befal that Fairy-Queen of thine,</br>In whose fair Eyes, Love link'd with Vertue sits:</br>Ensuing by those Beauties Fires Divine,</br>Such high Conceits into thy humble Wits,</br>As raised hath poor Pastors oaten Reeds,</br>From rustick Tunes, to chaunt heroick Deeds.", "So mought thy Red-cross Knight, with happy hand,</br>Victorious be in that fair Island's right,</br>Which thou doost veil in Type of Fairy-Land,</br>Elyza's blessed Field, that Albion hight.</br>That shields her Friends, and wars her mighty Foes;</br>Yet still with People, Peace, and Plenty flows.", "But (jolly Shepherd) though with pleasing Stile,</br>Thou feast the Humour of that Courtly Train:</br>Let not Conceit thy setled Sense beguile,</br>Ne daunted be through Envy or Disdain.</br>Subject thy Doom to her Empyring Spright,</br>From whence thy Muse, and all the World takes light.</br>"]
