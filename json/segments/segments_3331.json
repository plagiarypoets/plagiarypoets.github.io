["Thou art not silent! &mdash; oracles are thine</br>Which the wind utters, and the spirit hears,</br>Lingering, 'mid ruined fane and broken shrine,</br>O'er many a tale and trace of other years!</br>Bright as an ark, o'er all the flood of tears</br>That warps thy cradle-land &mdash; thine earthly love&mdash;</br>Where hours of hope, 'mid centuries of fears,</br>Have gleamed, like lightnings through the gloom above,</br>Stands, roofless to the sky, thy house, Olympian Jove!", "Thy columned aisles with whispers of the past</br>Are vocal! &mdash; and, along thine ivied walls,</br>While Elian echoes murmur in the blast,</br>And wild flowers hang, like victor-coronals,</br>In vain the turbaned tyrant rears his halls,</br>And plants the symbol of his faith and slaughters!&mdash;</br>Now, even now, the beam of promise falls</br>Bright upon Hellas, as her own bright daughters,</br>And a Greek Ararat is rising o'er the waters!", "Thou art not silent! &mdash; when the southern fair,</br>Ionia's moon, looks down upon thy breast,</br>Smiling, as pity smiles above despair,</br>Soft as young beauty, soothing age to rest,</br>Sings the night-spirit in thy weedy crest;</br>And she, the minstrel of the moonlight hours!</br>Breathes, like some lone one sighing to be blest,</br>Her lay &mdash; half hope, half sorrow &mdash; from the flowers,</br>And hoots the prophet owl, amid his tangled bowers!", "And, round thine altar's mouldering stones are born</br>Mysterious harpings, &mdash; wild as ever crept</br>From him who waked Aurora, every morn,</br>And sad as those he sung her, till she slept!</br>A thousand and a thousand years have swept</br>O'er thee, who wert a moral from thy spring,</br>A wreck in youth! &mdash; nor vainly hast thou kept</br>Thy lyre, &mdash; Olympia's soul is on the wing,</br>And a new Iphitus has waked, beneath its string!</br>"]
