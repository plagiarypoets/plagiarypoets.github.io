["Be still, ye winds!  ye restless waves, be still!&mdash;</br>Yon bark, so lightly tost on ocean swell,</br>Bears one that wakes the fond parental thrill,</br>And many a hope and fear, that none can tell.&mdash;</br>France!  now thy fatal thunders keep ashore!</br>No merchant-treasure skims the distant deep;</br>All thou canst gain, for streams of wasted gore,</br>Are tears, that unoffending parents weep,</br>And midnight sighs from those, that mournful vigils keep!", "Be still, ye winds! &mdash; be still ye waters blue;&mdash;</br>&mdash;Ye zephyrs, that around the vessel sport!</br>Mistake the rosy boy for one of you,</br>And waft him gently to the destin'd port!</br>An early mariner on life's wide sea,</br>Six smiling summers scarce have seen him bloom,</br>He knows not of the cares &mdash; that are to be,</br>And wonders whence his mother's sorrows come,</br>And thinks, at coming dawn, again he'll be at home!", "At home! &mdash; yes, in those visions fair, unveil'd</br>By Angel-touch to slumb'ring infant mind,</br>Oft' shall the scene return, of sportive field,</br>Of early joys, and recollections kind&mdash;</br>&mdash;But, through the billows of the northern main,</br>Scotia!  the little Sailor seeks thy shore!&mdash;</br>A sterner school, where ruder seasons reign</br>To brace the vigorous nerve, and classic lore</br>Shall teach the expanding soul, by virtuous deeds of yore!", "Turn then, ye heavens, your angry flashes hence!</br>E'en brutes, that range untamed the desart wild,</br>Have bowed before the seraph Innocence,</br>And smooth'd their fierceness, when an infant smil'd!</br>To storms the merchant trusts in hope of gain,</br>But gazes anxious from the beacon-hill;</br>And now a richer freight is on the main,</br>And hopes more anxious now the bosom fill.&mdash;</br>&mdash;Be still, ye rising winds! &mdash; thou heaving deep, be still!</br>"]
