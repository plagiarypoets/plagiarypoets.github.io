["Ah!  why does the sun shed his beam,</br>Fair Nature to bless in the spring?</br>The fishes delight in the stream,</br>And the woodlark, ah!  why does she sing?</br>Away with each flower and fruit,</br>The music that melts in the mind;</br>Can the adder be charm'd with the lute?</br>Or has Beauty a smile for the blind?", "When the cottagers danc'd o'er the dew,</br>I was wont to be merry as they;</br>How bright was each pastoral view!</br>Till I wept the gay visions away.</br>Dear Delia, how long must I weep,</br>Till you love the poor shepherd alone?</br>Till you grant him the care of our sheep,</br>That the flock may be pen'd with his own!", "An hermitage stands by the brook,</br>By ivy all rudely o'ergrown,</br>There at noon I recline on my crook,</br>And attend to the turtle-dove's moan.</br>When the day's busy duties are done,</br>I sit by the cypress' sad tree;</br>For while Corydon walks in the sun,</br>The shade is most proper for me.", "Where the beech trees have darken'd the dale,</br>Young Colin my tears would attend;</br>He pitied a stranger so pale,</br>And forgot 'twas the face of a friend.</br>And soon shall the whole be forgot,</br>My pen, and my pipe, and my song;</br>And Delia, believe me or not,</br>I'm persuaded it cannot be long.</br>"]
