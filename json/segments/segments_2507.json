["Hush'd is the voice of War, and o'er the ground</br>Sits deathlike Silence, brooding, dark, and deep;</br>Save where low groans, or dying pray'rs resound,</br>Or Sorrow faintly shrieks, too sad to weep;", "Save where, the rav'ning Vulture screaming by,</br>Propt on his sword the pensive Veteran bends,</br>And, Nature speaking in his pensive eye,</br>Guards the pale relics of his slaughter'd Friends.", "Fall'n are the Chiefs who claim'd the van of fight,</br>Whose hearts beat high, and, as the orient ray</br>Flash'd mimic light'nings from their falchions bright,</br>Panted for Glory, and a deathful day.", "Yet shall their Spirits live, and, hov'ring near,</br>With the blest flame of Patriot Valour glow,</br>And oft their aery shapes shall scatter fear</br>At eve of Battle, thro' the shudd'ring Foe.", "But in the Britons, firm to ancient faith,</br>Shall they not breathe the soul of Loyalty?</br>Bid the sword leap spontaneous from the sheath,</br>Bid Vengeance arm, for Heav'n and Liberty?", "Yes, deathless Souls! &mdash; and round your honour'd bier</br>Affection's pleasing tribute oft shall flow:</br>A sad Memorial shall your Country rear,</br>Deck'd with the Trophies of Sepulchral Woe.", "There shall your FRED'RIC hang the Sculptur'd Urn</br>With living Laurel, and the Cypress gloom;</br>Revers'd the Flag of Victory shall mourn,</br>And Honour's blade lie drooping on your Tomb.", "There shall the war-worn Vet'ran oft repair,</br>And, as he reads your Story, trac'd by truth,</br>A smile shall brighten thro' the falling tear,</br>And his old veins glow with the fire of youth.", "\"'Tis but a pang, that shakes our mortal frame,</br>'Tis but a blow,\" the hoary Chief shall cry;</br>\"Then shall this Spirit mount on wings of flame,</br>This Body sleep, with these, in Peace and Victory.\"</br>"]
