["In old romance, the Gothic manners scan,</br>But scorn to be a savage brutal man.</br>Thy self to civilize, be first thy care,</br>Defend the helpless, ne'er delude the fair.</br>If like vile giants, passions thee controul,</br>They cloud thy reason, and debase thy soul.</br>Those mister-wights are grooms of evil guise,</br>That fawn or flatter, cheat or tyrannize.</br>By virtuous valour men must gain renown,</br>And chaste behaviour is the woman's crown.</br>Of feuds what Blackstone writes, if you peruse,</br>You'll find that Nature guides the Gothic muse.</br>When from the North a swarm of warriors came,</br>And independent roam'd for wealth and fame;</br>The vanquish'd natives were at their command,</br>Oblig'd to till their own paternal land;</br>And in due season all the produce yield,</br>Rais'd by their labour from the fertile field.</br>The conqu'ring chief, a bold ambitious man,</br>Was chosen king; each baron rul'd a clan,</br>Each common soldier had some land in fee,</br>And feudal tenants held by chivalry.</br>In peace the baron after Reynard flies,</br>Or hears a bard proclaim his victories;</br>And lest the art of war he shou'd forget,</br>A stated time for tournaments is set.</br>But if a lord in vice a giant grown,</br>Shou'd dare to invade a province not his own,</br>The injur'd lord and vassals him repel,</br>Sometimes by force, sometimes by magic spell:</br>The valiant knight then flies to Virtue's aid,</br>To seek, or rescue some chaste captive maid.</br>This habit by degrees exalts his mind</br>To wander o'er the globe to serve mankind.</br>At his return, his arms or bright renown</br>May gain an heiress, and, perhaps, a crown.</br>Tasso, like Homer, fav'rite of the nine,</br>Has unity of action and design;</br>The Grecian hero and the Goth we see</br>Alike in friendship, rage, and bravery.</br>Fairies enchant, and witches raise the dead;</br>Is more of Circe or Calypso said?</br>Did Hercules our great Saint George excel?</br>Men deify'd them both for fighting well.</br>Blame not the dream of fairies, witches, sprites,</br>Men erst believ'd whate'er sweet Tasso writes.</br>Believe he writes to men of such a creed,</br>His wond'rous magic will no comment need.</br>Creative wit disdains the vulgar bound,</br>Enchanted forest sees and fairy ground,</br>And he who best can admiration raise,</br>Is best entitled to the reader's praise.</br>Nought on the stage he shews; no, he relates</br>To our fond fancy what his muse creates.</br>Remove not Spencer from his list of fame,</br>But let his Fairy Queen his worth proclaim;</br>This Gothic bard well paints the Gothic field,</br>And scarce to Milton's classic muse does yield.", "Ye fair, no more in Chivalry delight,</br>Our laws, protect beyond the doughty knight;</br>Those nectar'd sweets that from your lips distil,</br>Disarm all knights, and ravish while they kill.</br>All feudal jars have left our happy land,</br>And Peace, fair Peace, now waves her olive wand.</br>Our well-mix'd state, ye loyal ladies, prize,</br>Where king, lords, commons guard our liberties;</br>Where GEORGE the Third, another Alfred reigns,</br>Ordain'd by Heav'n to bless his native plains.</br>"]
