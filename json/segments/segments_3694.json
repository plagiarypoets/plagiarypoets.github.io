["When the Morning's Orient light</br>Unveils the landscape to the sight&mdash;</br>And smoke from low-roof'd hamlets rise</br>In spiral columns to the skies:</br>When is heard the Woodman's stroke,</br>As he cleaves the stubborn oak,</br>And the wild-bird's lay of love,</br>Carol'd in the dusky grove,</br>And the milk-maid's sprightly song,</br>As she trips the meads among,</br>When the lowing cattle raise,</br>In Nature's voice the note of praise,</br>O!  rustic nymph!  with frolic air,</br>Thou, sweet Poesy, art there!", "When 'tis Noon, and ardent fire</br>Bids a fainting world retire&mdash;</br>And labour wipes the humid brow,</br>And seeks the shade the trees bestow;</br>And beneath some rugged rock,</br>The shepherd views his panting flock;</br>And all is quiet stillness round,</br>Save, that's heard the plaintive sound</br>Of the young rook's ceaseless call,</br>And the plashing waterfall,</br>And the gnat with busy wing,</br>When the herald of the spring</br>As a shepherd's clock the note,</br>Doth the fleeting hour denote,</br>In Nature's harmony around,</br>Thou sweet Poesy, art found!", "When Evening comes with purple ray,</br>And beams the faint decline of day;</br>When the bee with waxen thighs</br>Homeward swiftly, laden hies;</br>And his task of labour o'er,</br>Seated at the cottage door,</br>The peasant quaffs the nutbrown ale,</br>And hears again the oft-told tale;</br>Whilst as the ling'ring hours beguil'd,</br>The housewife rocks her sleeping child;</br>Or, the mother's love exprest,</br>Fondly lulls it on her breast;</br>When young and old, beneath the tree,</br>Dance to village minstrelsy;</br>With cheerful face, and modest mien,</br>Thou, sweet Poesy, art seen!", "When Night, with sable stole around,</br>Invests the world with gloom profound;</br>And Nature hush'd in soft repose,</br>Man seeks oblivion of his woes!</br>When Luna's tranquil, pallid beams,</br>O'er the dark foliage silv'ry gleams;</br>And Heaven with sparkling, brilliant rays,</br>Lifts the rapt soul to sacred praise!</br>When angels wake their golden lyre,</br>And hymning seraphs to the choir,</br>In varied melody the strain,</br>Their great Creator's love proclaim!</br>Celestial guest!  and power divine!</br>Sweet Poesy!  the lay is thine!</br>"]
