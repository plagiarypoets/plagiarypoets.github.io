["O thou, dread foe of honour, wealth, and fame,</br>Whose touch can quell the strong, the fierce can tame,</br>Relentless fear!  ah!  why did fate ordain</br>My trembling heart to own thy iron reign?</br>There are, thrice happy!  who disdain thy sway,</br>The merchant wand'ring o'er the wat'ry way;</br>The chief serene before th' assaulted wall;</br>The climbing statesman thoughtless of his fall;</br>All whom the love of wealth or pow'r inspires,</br>And all who burn with proud ambition's fires;</br>But peaceful bards thy constant presence know,</br>O thou of ev'ry glorious deed the foe!</br>Of thee the silent studious race complains,</br>And learning groans a captive in thy chains:</br>The secret wish when some fair object moves,</br>And cautious reason what we wish approves,</br>Thy gorgon front forbids to grasp the prize,</br>And seas are spread between, and mountains rise:</br>Thy magic arts a thousand phantoms raise,</br>And fancy'd depths and dangers fill our ways;</br>With smiling hope you wage eternal strife,</br>And envious snatch the cup of joy from life.</br>O leave, tremendous pow'r!  the blameless breast,</br>Of gilt alone, the tyrant and the guest;</br>Go, and thy train of sable horrors spread</br>Where murder meditates the future dead,</br>Where rapine watches for the gloom of night,</br>And lawless passion pants for other's right;</br>Go to the bad, but from the good receed,</br>No more the foe of ev'ry glorious deed.</br>"]
