["Fond memory lingers o'er the days of youth,</br>Whose rays effulgent glitter in the eye,</br>Whose hours, like odours on the fragrant south,</br>Roll on beneath an ever-glowing sky;</br>No scene around a pleasure can deny,</br>To hearts which e'er with living ardour glow,</br>A sweet response, whose echoes never die,</br>To His, who claims to be adored below</br>By Love, the bond of life, which smooths the warring brow.", "Time hides his flight from youth's enraptured view,</br>And seldom soars upon his raven wing,</br>But beams delightful burst in every hue</br>That charms the sight with one eternal spring;</br>The heart, too ardent, feels no secret sting</br>Rising beneath the roseous bed around,</br>Suspects no gale will grief, or sorrow bring,</br>No chords of love emit a jarring sound,</br>But that the fairy scene will never know a bound.", "Ah!  has thine eye ne'er paused upon the dawn,</br>Fretting the east with grand vermilion dies?</br>Seen mild Aurora, by her coursers drawn,</br>Recede before the sun's refulgent rise?</br>Short was the sheeny phantom to thine eyes,</br>Dazzling a moment &mdash; lost in vapours dun!</br>So fares life's morn &mdash; the beauty man descries;</br>It disappears, before the eye has won</br>Scarce one extatic view of what it dwells upon.", "Then raise thy view to heav'nly worlds on high,</br>Attune to strains sublime the warbling wire,</br>Seek views whose radiance cannot wane or die,</br>And cherish hope that never can expire;</br>So youth shall blossom o'er the tott'ring sire,</br>Immortal beauties wake the living strain,</br>Whose dulcet notes shall fan the latent fire</br>And spread abroad o'er Zion's golden plain,</br>The holy joys that spring from Love's eternal reign.</br>"]
