["Ye shepherds since Damon is dead,</br>Our Damon that sweetly could sing;</br>Since nature's glad songster is fled,</br>Accept the glad triubute I sing.", "The soft thrilling sisters lament,</br>They grieve on the Helicon shore;</br>And thus, whilst their anguish they vent,</br>Exclaim, \"Is our Damon no more?\"", "The fates thus they chide as they weep,</br>\"Why spun yet his life-time so fast?</br>Or, why the choice few that we'd keep,</br>To kill are ye ever in haste?\"", "For Damon, fond shepherd, they lov'd,</br>Who piped so sweet on the plains;</br>The meads and the lawns he approv'd,</br>Where now but dull languidness reigns.", "The nymphs that were wonted on Dee,</br>To listen his song, and be glad;</br>That danc'd to his metre with glee,</br>Are hypochondriacal and sad.", "Consumbed are all the gay flow'rs,</br>At the milking no singing is heard;</br>The birds are all mute in the bow'rs,</br>And nature declines for her bard.", "How mild, yet how jocund his lays,</br>Diana would call him her own;</br>He dropt, but encircled with bays,</br>He fell, but enwrapt with renown.", "Ye swains, bring me hither his flute,</br>The flute that my Damon wou'd use;</br>And let me, since none it will suit,</br>Now break it, or give it his muse:", "And each bring his straw-pipe along,</br>The straw-pipe that Pastora gave;</br>We'll commemorate him in song,</br>We'll join in a dirge by his grave.</br>"]
