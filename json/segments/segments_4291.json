Ev'ry act</br>And trivial circumstance recorded stands.</br>The long, long declaration, on whose base</br>All actions are erected, life o' th' cause,</br>And origin of matter, swells the charge.</br>To this succeeds a fee to council paid</br>Of one pound one, to methodize the draught.</br>Good harmless man!  he strives not to abridge</br>Prolixity &mdash; but, like an honest dealer,</br>Gives amplest measure &mdash; lengthens ev'ry count,</br>And puzzles special pleader.
