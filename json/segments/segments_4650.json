["The muse unwilling leaves the sacred shore</br>Where every virtue held its peaceful reign;&mdash;</br>Hangs with regret on scenes she lov'd before,</br>The last sad wanderer from the pensive plain.", "She views where once the sons of freedom stray'd,</br>Whose hard misfortunes claim the sigh sincere;</br>She saw fair Genius fly his native shade,</br>And dropt the panting tribute of a tear.&mdash;", "But why, sweet maid, so fondly dost thou cling</br>To rugged rocks where no soft verdure grows;</br>While climes more grateful court the tuneful string,</br>And point to vales of pleasure and repose?", "Haply thou lov'st to ease th' afflicting smart</br>That tears the breast by misery doom'd to mourn,</br>To gild the gloom around the victim's heart,</br>Or bend, with pity, o'er the patriot's urn.", "Or, haply where beneath the iron hand</br>Of stern oppression, youth's fair flow'rets fade,</br>Kindly with sympathy's endearing hand</br>And bright-eyed hope, thou cheer'st the dungeon's shade.", "For him who warm'd by freedom's genial fire,</br>With soul unfetter'd drags the despot's chain,</br>Perhaps thy hand attunes the living lyre,</br>To soothe his woes by music's magic strain.", "And thou, gay Fancy, bless his languid hours,</br>Each flattering phantom let thy care bestow,</br>To strew his lonely path with fairy flowers,</br>And pluck the noxious nettles as they grow.&mdash;", "Say, and ye powers of Truth, accordant join!</br>The time shall come &mdash; that Fate has fix'd the doom&mdash;</br>The friends of suffering Virtue shall combine</br>And hurl each blood-stain'd tyrant to the tomb.</br>"]
