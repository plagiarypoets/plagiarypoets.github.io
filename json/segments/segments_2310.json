["SCENE, THE BANKS OF THE OHIO.</br>TIME, MORNING.", "Scarce had the morn her orient course begun,</br>Or early breeze fann'd the rising sun,</br>When Mingo on Ohio's margin stood,</br>And told his sorrows to the gliding flood:&mdash;", "\"With love of glory would the chiefs inflame</br>My breast; &mdash; and lead me to the field of fame:</br>In vain with glee, they shew their scalps and scars,</br>The glorious trophies of their forest wars,</br>On me their praises and reproofs are lost,</br>No flame but love &mdash; but scorching love I boast,</br>The nimble Lawrah does my breath inspire,</br>Wakes ev'ry sense, and sets me all on fire:</br>Enraptur'd while I view her yellow neck,</br>As soft as bear-grease, and as beaver sleek,</br>From her grey eyes the living lightnings rush,</br>Like the fresh dew-drops glitt'ring thro' a bush.</br>But vain my songs re-echo thro' the shade,</br>Nor vows, nor tears, can move the haughty maid.</br>Yet other nymphs with fruitless ardor burn,</br>And feel a passion I can ne'er return.</br>In vain, with gifts of fish, Agolla strove</br>To shake my constancy and win my love,</br>Her rough advances like a skunk I shun,</br>And from her face with eager footsteps run.</br>But vain, my songs re-echo thro' the grove,</br>Nor vows, nor tears, the haughty maid can move:</br>Then cease these fruitless plaints, I'll take my spear,</br>And thro' the forest chace the shaggy bear;</br>The bounding buck shall own my oft-try'd art,</br>And feel this arrow rankling in his heart.\"</br>"]
