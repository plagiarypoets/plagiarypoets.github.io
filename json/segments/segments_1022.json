["No remedy the power of Love subdues;</br>No medicine, dearest Nicias, but the Muse:</br>This plain prescription gratifies the mind</br>With sweet complacence &mdash; but how hard to find!</br>This well you know, who first in physic shine,</br>And are the lov'd familiar of the Nine.", "Thus the fam'd Cyclops, Polypheme, when young,</br>Calm'd his fond passion with the power of song;</br>When blooming years imbib'd the soft desire,</br>And Galatea kindled amorous fire;</br>He gave no wreaths of roses to the fair,</br>Nor apples, nor sweet parsley for her hair:</br>Love did the tenour of his mind controul,</br>And took the whole possession of his soul.</br>His flocks untended oft refus'd to feed,</br>And, for the fold, forsook the grassy mead;</br>While on the sedgy shore he lay reclin'd,</br>And sooth'd with song the anguish of his mind.</br>From morn to night he pin'd, for Love's keen dart</br>Had pierc'd the deep recesses of his heart:</br>Yet, yet a cure he found &mdash; for on a steep,</br>Rough-pointed rock, that overlook'd the deep,</br>And with brown horror high-impending hung,</br>The giant monster sat, and thus he sung:", "\"Fair nymph, why will you thus my passion slight!</br>Softer than lambs you seem, than curds more white,</br>Wanton as calves before the udder'd kine,</br>Harsh as the unripe fruitage of the vine.</br>You come when pleasing sleep has clos'd mine eye,</br>And, like a vision, with my slumbers fly,</br>Swift as before the wolf the lambkin bounds,</br>Panting and trembling, o'er the furrow'd grounds.</br>Then first I lov'd, and thence I date my flame,</br>When here to gather hyacinths you came:</br>My mother brought you &mdash; 'twas a fatal day;</br>And I, alas!  unwary led the way:</br>E'er since my tortur'd mind has known no rest;</br>Peace is become a stranger to my breast:</br>Yet you nor pity, nor relieve my pain&mdash;</br>Yes, yes I know the cause of your disdain;</br>For, stretcht from ear to ear with shagged grace,</br>My single brow adds horror to my face;</br>My single eye enormous lids enclose,</br>And o'er my blubber'd lips projects my nose.</br>Yet, homely as I am, large flocks I keep,</br>And drain the udders of a thousand sheep;</br>My pails with milk, my shelves with cheese they fill,</br>In summer scorching, and in winter chill.</br>The vocal pipe I tune with pleasing glee,</br>No other Cyclops can compare with me:</br>Your charms I sing, sweet apple of delight!</br>Myself and you I sing the live-long night.</br>For you ten fawns, with collars deck'd, I feed,</br>And four young bears for your diversion breed:</br>Come, live with me; all these you may command,</br>And change your azure ocean for the land:</br>More pleasing slumbers will my cave bestow,</br>There spiry Cypress and green laurels grow;</br>There round my trees the sable ivy twines,</br>And grapes, as sweet as honey, load my vines:</br>From grove-crown'd Aetna, rob'd in purest snow,</br>Cool springs roll nectar to the swains below.</br>Say, who would quit such peaceful scenes as these</br>For blustering billows, and tempestuous seas?</br>Though my rough form's no object of desire,</br>My oaks supply me with abundant fire;</br>My hearth unceasing blazes &mdash; though I swear</br>By this one eye, to me for ever dear,</br>Well might that fire to warm my breast suffice,</br>That kindled at the lightning of your eyes.</br>Had I, like fish, with fins and gills been made,</br>Then might I in your element have play'd,</br>With ease have div'd beneath your azure tide,</br>And kiss'd your hand, though you your lips deny'd?</br>Brought lilies fair, or poppies red that grow</br>In summer's solstice, or in winter's snow;</br>These flowers I could not both together bear</br>That bloom in different seasons of the year.</br>Well, I'm resolv'd, fair nymph, I'll learn to dive,</br>If e'er a sailor at this port arrive,</br>Then shall I surely by experience know</br>What pleasures charm you in the deeps below.</br>Emerge, O Galatea!  from the sea,</br>And here forget your native home like me.</br>O would you feed my flock, and milk my ewes,</br>And ere you press my cheese the runnet sharp infuse!</br>My mother is my only foe I fear;</br>She never whispers soft things in your ear,</br>Although she knows my grief, and every day</br>Sees how I languish, pine and waste away.</br>I, to alarm her, will aloud complain,</br>And more disorders than I suffer feign,</br>Say my head akes, sharp pains my limbs oppress,</br>That she may feel, and pity my distress.</br>Ah, Cyclops, Cyclops, where's your reason fled!&mdash;</br>If with the leafy spray your lambs you fed,</br>Or, ev'n wove baskets, you would seem more wise;</br>Milk the first cow, pursue not her that flies:</br>You'll soon, since Galatea proves unkind,</br>A sweeter, fairer Galatea find.</br>Me gamesome girls to sport and toy invite,</br>And meet my kind compliance with delight:</br>Sure I may draw this fair conclusion hence,</br>Here I'm a man of no small consequence.\"", "Thus Cyclops learn'd Love's torments to endure,</br>And calm'd that passion which he could not cure.</br>More sweetly far with song he sooth'd his heart,</br>Than if his gold had brib'd the doctor's art.</br>"]
