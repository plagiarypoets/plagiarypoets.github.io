["Awake once more my Lyre!  thou who hast been</br>On woody upland and o'er grassy lea,</br>Thro' many a calm and many a stormy scene</br>The sharer of my feelings &mdash; and shalt be!</br>Thou who hast been what few have been to me,</br>Ne'er with a deeper feeling of delight</br>Did I awake thy earlier minstrelsy,</br>When but the wood-nymphs heard thy numbers' flight</br>Winging its artless way thro' the blue-starry night&mdash;", "Yes, never did this hand awake thy string</br>With deeper rapture than it now awakes,</br>Tho' the wild song which thou wert wont to sing</br>Must be forgot, and tho' thy soul forsakes</br>The luxury of green groves and glassy lakes,</br>To woo the unsparing world's fastidious ear,</br>Yet need'st thou not lament thy bow'rs and brakes,</br>Thy distant waterfalls and currents clear,</br>And oft the approving voice of listening mountaineer;&mdash;", "For there is one, thy country's friend and thine,</br>But for whose patron-voice thou shouldst not go</br>Forth from thy haunts of rose and eglantine;&mdash;</br>Who will not know thee when he deigns to know,</br>\"Good without effort &mdash; great without a foe?\"</br>And tho' thou'rt stranger to the force and fire</br>Of other chords, thou must not tremble, &mdash; no!&mdash;</br>Were but his ear to hear, whom all admire,</br>Great were thy minstrel's meed: &mdash; then wake once more my lyre!</br>"]
