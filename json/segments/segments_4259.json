["Not the dew-drop besprinkling the rose,</br>Nor the violet, the first of the vale,</br>More beauties, tho' blended, disclose,</br>Than the Flow'r I late found on the dale.</br>When I found it to pity was due,</br>A sigh for the soil so severe,</br>And hence favour'd it flourish'd anew,</br>On the bosom of Phebe the Fair.", "The breeze that perchance us'd to stray,</br>Or the sun that so carelessly shone,</br>It mourn'd not, &mdash; her breath was the May,</br>And her eye a more nourishing sun.</br>With her cheek tho' 'twould vie, and in vain,</br>With her bosom in softness compare,</br>One must own where a 'semblance could reign,</br>'Twas the nearest to Phebe the Fair.", "'Tis told, and the tale I believe,</br>That Chasteness of Heav'n is the child,</br>For the sky-woven vest of the eve,</br>And the tears of the sky are less mild.</br>To the fair Flow'r, the tears of the sky,</br>As the sun-beam at day-dawn were dear;</br>Ah!  marvel we not it should die,</br>On the bosom of Phebe the Fair!", "The cowslip that blooms unconfin'd,</br>Transplanted may pine in the bow'r,</br>For to very what soil is assign'd,</br>Not the oak not a shrub can endure.</br>On the Virtues so wont to rely,</br>Such a heart what deceit could ensnare!</br>Ah!  marvel we now it should die</br>On the bosom of Phebe the Fair.", "Its spice gave the breath of the west,</br>And the tulip its velvet in vain,</br>And the rainbow so lavishly drest,</br>Those tints that no art can retain.</br>Yet their flight, tho' no art could delay,</br>Will no reason their failings repair;</br>Ah!  now, what a tear can convey,</br>That tear shall be Phebe's the Fair!</br>"]
