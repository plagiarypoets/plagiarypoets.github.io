["Mount of the clouds!  on whose Olympian height</br>The tall rocks brighten in the ether air,</br>And spirits from the skies come down at night,</br>To chant immortal songs to Freedom there!</br>Thine is the rock of other regions; where</br>The world of life which blooms so far below</br>Sweeps a wide waste:  no gladdening scenes appear,</br>Save where with silvery flash the waters flow</br>Beneath the far off mountain, distant, calm, and slow.", "Thine is the summit where the clouds repose,</br>Or eddying wildly round thy cliffs are borne;</br>When Tempest mounts his rushing car, and throws</br>His billowy mist amid the thunder's home!</br>Far down the deep ravines the whirlwinds come,</br>And bow the forest as they sweep along;</br>While roaring deeply from their rocky womb</br>The storms come forth &mdash; and hurrying darkly on,</br>Amid the echoing peaks the revelry prolong!", "And when the tumult of the air is fled,</br>And quench'd in silence all the tempest flame,</br>There come the dim forms of the mighty dead,</br>Around the steep which bears the hero's name.</br>The stars look down upon them &mdash; and the same</br>Pale orb that glistens o'er his distant grave,</br>Gleams on the summit that enshrines his fame,</br>And lights the cold tear of the glorious brave&mdash;</br>The richest, purest tear, that memory ever gave!", "Mount of the clouds!  when winter round thee throws</br>The hoary mantle of the dying year,</br>Sublime amid the canopy of snows,</br>Thy towers in bright magnificence appear!</br>'Tis then we view thee with a chilling fear,</br>Till summer robes thee in her tints of blue;</br>When lo!  in soften'd grandeur, far, yet clear,</br>Thy battlements stand clothed in heaven's own hue,</br>To swell as Freedom's home on man's unbounded view!</br>"]
