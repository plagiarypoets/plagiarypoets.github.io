["Come, gentle truth, and lay his bosom bare,</br>No more shall slander now pursue the dead;</br>Here rests a bard from all his grief and care,</br>No horrid guilt disturbs his peaceful shade!", "His fond desire it was like man to feel,</br>To ease the wretched, and relieve the poor!</br>If other's pain he saw, and could not heal,</br>He sigh'd &mdash; and what could pity's self do more!", "Bless'd in his parents, each of temper kind,</br>No tyrant-nature in his bosom rag'd;</br>Yet kindling to oppose the' oppressive mind,</br>With such, undaunted, oft' he was engag'd!", "Here lay his worth, if any worth he had,</br>And all his frailty was \"the soft extreme;\"</br>Blame him who can, with such a nature clad!</br>Christians beware &mdash; let Jews and Heathens blame.", "If to one sect he shew'd peculiar love,</br>He kindly gave his hand to all the rest;</br>This was his chief concern, for this he strove,</br>That all in Jesu's Spirit might be bless'd!</br>"]
