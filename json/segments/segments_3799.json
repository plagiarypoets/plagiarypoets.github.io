["October mounts his ebon throne,</br>In Scorpio Phoebus rules the day;</br>The foliage of the plain is gone,</br>Mild autumn's honours fade away,</br>And shivers at each blast:</br>Behold the rueful widow'd trees,</br>Their glories mourning in the breeze,</br>Which to the bleating winds are cast;</br>While skies prophetic of stern winter wear</br>A lowring sable robe, and bring the nipping air.", "Descend, Calliope, blest muse,</br>Daughter of Memory divine!</br>Inspire a poet, who would chuse</br>The verse that seeks thy vestal shrine,</br>That art can't imitate:</br>Thy aid obtain'd, the humble swain</br>May soaring rise, and quit the plain,</br>On Fancy's wings new world's create,</br>Thro' seas, earth, air, and the wide circling sky,</br>Take in the boundless sight by thy all-piercing eye.", "Did not dear Mem'ry still remain,</br>Could Needham's wit and beauty live?</br>Joys once possess'd would sure be vain:</br>But flying minutes to retrieve,</br>That lend to fancy wings;</br>Brightens each thought, and gives new fires,</br>She speaks, &mdash; and all the soul inspires,</br>While Rapture tip-to'd sweetly sings:</br>The flatt'ring image wears a livelier grace,</br>And shews a beauteous form, with an enchanting face.", "Now barns receive their yellow stores,</br>Aloud proclaim the thrasher's flail;</br>Echo repeats the sounding floors,</br>Vibrating thro' the neigh'bring vale,</br>The rustic's lonely toil:</br>Encircled round with piles of wheat,</br>And sheaves lie spread beneath his feet,</br>Enraptur'd sees the golden spoil:</br>While threshing on his wooden sceptre waves,</br>And claims the tribute of ten thousand prostrate slaves.", "Here Liberty, sweet goddess, reigns,</br>The guardian of her fav'rite isle;</br>Her empire gilds the fertile plains;</br>Here seated may she ever smile,</br>Nurse of each lib'ral art:</br>She makes Great Britain blithe and gay,</br>Benignity chears the happy day,</br>The lasting sun-shine of the heart!</br>Long, long may Britons share her placid smile,</br>For ever to remain the free, the happy isle.", "New dipt in all the dies that glow,</br>Blest offspring sprung from Liberty,</br>That radiant shines in Iris' bow;</br>Come fancy, &mdash; ever fair and free,</br>A vot'ry with thee stray,</br>To boundless worlds in aether fly,</br>Revolving orbits to descry,</br>And swiftly skim the milky way:</br>To view the seas and plains, extended wide,</br>While in the curling dappled clouds sublimely ride.</br>"]
