["On a calm, and clear river brink,</br>Clarissa sat chearfully down,</br>Delighted with freedom to think,</br>And pleas'd to be absent from town.</br>The birds, from the woods all around,</br>With warbling delighted her ear;</br>And the waters in murmurs fell down</br>From a nat'ral cascade that was near.", "How pleasantly does our time pass,</br>(She to her companion did say),</br>Since first we arriv'd in this place,</br>Where now we will constantly stay!</br>While every thing round us looks gay,</br>In innocent, harmless delight,</br>We'll chearfully spend every day,</br>And books will divert us at night.", "We'll strive to imbellish our minds,</br>Our noblest part we will store,</br>With knowledge of various kinds,</br>Which lasts when frail beauty's no more.</br>Amusements that innocent are,</br>All our vacant hours shall employ;</br>While free from each anxious, vain care,</br>Contentment will heighten our joy.", "A happiness thus we possess,</br>Which belles in the town never find,</br>Their pleasure consists in their dress;</br>But ours, in improvement of mind.</br>Let them have their visiting days;</br>More real delight we can feel,</br>In reading Shakspear's old plays,</br>Than spending our time at quadrille.", "And see the dear source of my joy;</br>Sure heaven our union approves:</br>With him comes my smiling young boy,</br>Who shares in our innocent loves.</br>And now, my Eliza, you'll own,</br>If you'd the truth frankly declare,</br>No fluttering beau of the town</br>Can with my Alexis compare.", "Youth, beauty, and each manly grace,</br>I in my dear partner do find,</br>But what are the charms of his face,</br>To the nobler charms of his mind!</br>There goodness and friendship doth shine,</br>And virtue, quite free from all art;</br>With these, his good sense too did join</br>To captivate my yielding heart.", "And with them young Strephon appears,</br>Whose heart my Eliza alarms,</br>O free the dear youth from his fears,</br>And yield him thy numberless charms.</br>Such virtue the swain doth possess,</br>That surely thy heart must approve</br>His merit, and freely confess,</br>He only deserves all thy love.", "Thus happy Clarissa doth live,</br>And here she for ever may find</br>(The blessing which Fortune can't give)</br>A real contentment of mind.</br>She with her lov'd spouse doth possess</br>The pleasures retirement doth give;</br>And all that do know them, confess,</br>No couple more happy can live.</br>"]
