["I've found out a spot for my fair,</br>Where the woodbines and ivy do meet,</br>Sweet vi'lets perfume all the air,</br>And daisies bloom under his feet;</br>Where clumps of green holly adorn,</br>A brook that meandering flows,</br>And bleating flocks just newly shorn,</br>Resound through the neighbouring groves.", "The plowman there turns up the ground,</br>And whistles along through the day;</br>The vallies with lowings resound,</br>As homewards the herd wind their way;</br>The hills bloom around with the thorn,</br>The lawns are all cover'd with hay,</br>Green hedges, the fields do adorn,</br>And birds sweetly sing on each spray.", "Such natural beauties are there,</br>And verdure e'er smiles o'er the land;</br>Much grac'd they will be by my fair,</br>And improv'd by her fost'ring hand.</br>Contentment will always attend,</br>And harmony tune its sweet lyre;</br>Dear Plenty her friendship will lend,</br>As soon as she joins in the choir.&mdash;", "Then, come my fair, let us away?</br>Together we'll plant the sweet rose,</br>Then haste thee, fond damsel, I pray?</br>See the zephyr, inviting us, blows:</br>The flowers shed forth their perfume</br>Round the place, that I've fix'd for your seat;</br>The trees in their foliage now bloom,</br>The shepherds have nam'd it Retreat.</br>"]
