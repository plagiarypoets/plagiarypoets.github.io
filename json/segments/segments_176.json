before)</br>Unto the greene wood wends, omits no paine</br>Might bring her to her Lords embrace againe:</br>But Fate thus crost her, comming where hee lay</br>Wearied with hunting all a Summers day,</br>Hee somewhat heard within the thicket rush,</br>And deeming it some Beast, hid in a bush,</br>Raised himselfe, then set on wing a dart,</br>Which tooke a sad rest in the restlesse

drinke,</br>When from her golden quiver she tooke forth</br>A Dart, above the rest esteem'd for worth,</br>And sent it to his side:  the gaping wound</br>Gave purple streames to coole the parched ground.</br>Whereat hee gnasht his teeth, storm'd his hurt lym,</br>Yeelded the earth what it denyed him:</br>Yet sunke not there, but (wrapt in horror) hy'd</br>Unto his hellish cave, despair'd and
