["As lately I saunter'd awhile,</br>To muse on the triumphs of fate,</br>Where Phoebus vouchsafes us a smile,</br>And says his is Cherwell's retreat.", "All nature look'd haggard and sad,</br>The verdure had left the lone shade:</br>No rose bud with blushes was clad,</br>The violets were wither'd and dead.", "The walks, which like mansions of state,</br>Frown'd awful, and bid us be wise,</br>Late haunts of the learned and great,</br>Deserted, in terrors arise.", "Sad Isis around her dear mead,</br>And willows now murmurs her woe,</br>While Cherwell's to sooth the dear maid,</br>Swoln waters in concert o'erflow.", "Then, fairest Eliza, say true,</br>And pardon the suit of the swain;</br>Shall time ever blast the fair hue,</br>Or wither the roses?  explain.", "Her blushes an answer deny,</br>And say she's the sweetest of flowers;</br>Then, shepherds, her swain shall reply,</br>And speak for the fair he adores.", "Fond nature too kind to the maid,</br>Has deckt her in all that was fair,</br>Each virtue has lent her its aid,</br>And innocence own'd her her care.", "Oh!  could I (but ah!  'tis in vain)</br>Conceal what I dread to relate,</br>Eliza, thou pride of the plain,</br>Must yield to the mandate of fate.", "Thy roses, those daughters of joy,</br>Those eyes which now sparkle delight,</br>The winter of time shall destroy,</br>Nor shepherds confess they are bright.", "Thy suitors no longer will praise,</br>No longer they faulter and sigh:</br>When age is equipp'd with thy bays,</br>And says Libitina is nigh.", "Yet time cannot rob thee of joy,</br>Tho' envy should rifle thy charms,</br>If virtue endears the soft tie,</br>And locks the fond swain in thy arms.</br>"]
