["Come, Radicals!  haste to the Rolls,</br>Let us see what our Henry is made;</br>Let us go not with sorrowful souls,</br>For see how, at last, he is is paid.</br>They call'd him the pride of the Bar;</br>In truth, he could speechify well;</br>With the Judge though he did not go far,</br>With the Jury he often would tell.", "What though, in the course of a cause,</br>He a witness would bully and fright;</br>And, as counsel all learned in the laws,</br>Say that which no other man might.</br>Howe'er he might slander or joke,</br>He never was fond of a quarrel;</br>\"They were privileged words that he spoke,\"</br>And would cite you the case of Mackerril.", "No more shall long speeches prevail,</br>In St. Stephens no faults shall appear;</br>All mischiefs and grievances fail,</br>And our Chancery system be clear;</br>No tongue its abuses shall tell&mdash;</br>(Abuses so flagrant before)&mdash;</br>For he who could paint them so well</br>Will talk of abuses no more.", "Queen Caroline, fond of his praise,</br>And the character bright that he gave her,</br>Once swore she was lost in amaze</br>That he should so humbug and palaver.</br>But, ye Radicals!  trust him no more,</br>For your Henry has turned out a fudge,</br>And the high-minded patriot of yore,</br>Is transform'd to an Equity Judge.</br>"]
