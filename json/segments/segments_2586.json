["Sad child, by frowning poverty deprest,</br>With vestment dank, and wildly-dripping hair,</br>The prey of ev'ry blast,</br>Hurl'd in the tempest round.", "Ah torn, perhaps, ah torn, in infant years,</br>From tender parents, and from shelt'ring home,</br>How throbs thy guileless breast,</br>Made bare by the rude wind!", "The laughing Loves forsake thy radiant eyes,</br>Yet piteous leave their brilliants on thy lids,</br>Which chase each other down,</br>In glitt'ring drops of woe.", "Ah harmless boy!  yet doom'd to suffer pain,</br>To hear loud cordage lash the groaning mast,</br>While wat'ry mountains huge</br>Roar dread destruction round.", "Ah!  hapless!  born to give thy little life</br>To the wide-gaping sea, or mingling storm;</br>Or 'mid the fractur'd wrecks,</br>Or floating corses pale,", "'Tis thine, to hear hoarse seamen's dying groans,</br>To witness heaps of hanging waters dire,</br>When steers with belly'd sail</br>No friendly saving bark.", "'Tis thine, perhaps, to die in deserts wild,</br>Where no fond parent soothes thy parting soul!</br>Unknown, to die unblest,</br>A naked bleaching corse,", "That owns no decent grave, no letter'd pile,</br>But doom'd the prey of fierce voracious fowls</br>While friends may ardent wish,</br>Yet strangers to thy fate,", "The safe return of injur'd innocence!</br>When thou, perhaps, no more wilt e're return,</br>To taste parental bliss,</br>Or soothe declining age.", "Then share, come share with me my humble shed,</br>Amid my little sons be truly blest,</br>And heal with friendly balms,</br>Thy sufferings and thy toils.</br>"]
