["Queen of my songs, harmonious maid,</br>Why, why hast thou withdrawn thy aid?</br>Why thus forsook my widow'd breast,</br>With dark infeebling damps oppress'd?</br>Where is the bold prophetic heat,</br>With which my bosom wont to beat?</br>Where all the bright, mysterious dreams</br>Of haunted shades and tuneful streams,</br>That woo'd my Genius to divinest themes?", "Say, can the purple charms of wine</br>Or young DIONE'S form divine,</br>Or flatt'ring scenes of promis'd fame</br>Relume thy faint, thy dying flame?</br>Have soft, melodious airs the pow'r</br>To give one free, poetic hour?</br>Or, from amid th' Elysian train,</br>The soul of MILTON shall I gain,</br>To win thee back with some coelestial strain?", "O mighty mind!  O sacred flame!</br>My spirit kindles at this name;</br>Again my lab'ring bosom burns;</br>The Muse, th' inspiring Muse returns!</br>Such on the banks of TYNE confest,</br>I hail'd the bright, etherial guest,</br>When first she seal'd me for her own,</br>Made all her blissful treasures known,</br>And bad me swear to follow HER alone.</br>"]
