["'Twas just in the spring-tide of May,</br>When Flora the fields did adorn;</br>The village look'd chearful and gay,</br>And the blossom sweet blow'd on the thorn;</br>Beneath the cool shade of an oak,</br>While their flocks frisk'd about the green mead;</br>To two swains young Palemon thus spoke;</br>\"Come, Shepherds resume the soft reed.", "\"Awhile here in friendly dispute,</br>In behalf of the Fair tune your lays;</br>And his be this sweet breathing flute,</br>Whose song shall deserve the most praise.</br>You Damon the contest begin,</br>Let truth both your sentiments guide;</br>Whether you or Alexis shall win,</br>The cause I'll with candour decide.\"", "DAMON.</br>\"Ye swains, to my subject attend,</br>The charms of a fair one I sing,</br>Whom no tongue can sufficient commend,</br>Who is blooming and fair as the spring,</br>Her cheek's like the soft damask rose,</br>Surrounded with snow-drops and lillies;</br>Her mind with each rare virtue glows,</br>And who can compare to my Phillis?\"", "ALEXIS.</br>\"You may boast of your Phillis's charms,</br>In sooth, she is handsome and young;</br>But the fair who my bosom alarms,</br>Can never with justice be sung,</br>Indeed, there are two I admire,</br>And, when one I endeavour to praise,</br>My muse t' other's virtues inspire,</br>And claims a due share in my lays.", "\"Such pleasure their merits impart,</br>Their worth I enough can't extol;</br>Fair Patty engages each heart,</br>And Eliza enchants every soul.</br>If you search thro' the plain far and nigh,</br>Believe me you never can find,</br>Two Nymphs that with these ere can vie,</br>In beauties of person and mind.\"", "PALEMON.</br>\"Cease shepherds, cease, cease your dispute,</br>You, Damon, your claim must resign,</br>Alexis has well won the flute,</br>But this ebon crook shall be thine.</br>Indeed, I must freely confess,</br>If our nymphs we examine with care,</br>None half such perfections possess,</br>As Eliza and Patty the fair.\"</br>"]
