["ROGET.  WILLIE.", "ROGET.</br>Prithee Willy, tell me this,</br>What new thing late hapned is,</br>Thou (that wert the blythest lad)</br>Art become so wondrous sad?</br>And so careless of thy quill,</br>As if thou had'st lost thy skill.</br>Thou wert wont to charme thy Flockes,</br>And among the massy rockes</br>Hast so cheer'd me with thy Song,</br>That I have forgot my wrong.</br>Something hath thee surely crost,</br>That thy old wont thou hast lost,</br>But what is't?  Have I ought said</br>That hath made thee misapaid?</br>Hath some Churle done thee a spite?</br>Dost thou misse a lambe to night?</br>Frownes thy fairest Shepheards Lasse?</br>Or how comes this ill to passe?</br>Is there any discontent</br>Worse than this my banishment?", "WILLIE.</br>Why, doth that so evil seeme</br>That thou nothing worse dost deeme?</br>Shepheard, there full many be,</br>That will change Contents with thee.</br>Those that choose their walkes at will,</br>On the valley or the Hill.</br>Or those pleasures boast of can</br>Groves or fields may yeeld to man:</br>Never come to know the rest</br>Wherewithal thy minde is blest.</br>Many a one that oft resorts</br>To make up the troope at sports,</br>And in company somewhile,</br>Happens to straine forth a smile:</br>Feeles more want, more outward smart,</br>And more inward griefe of hart,</br>Than this place can bring to thee,</br>While thy minde remaineth free.</br>Thou condemn'st my want of mirth,</br>But what find'st thou in this earth,</br>Wherein ought may bee beleeved</br>Worth to make me joy'd or grieved?</br>And yet feele I (natheless)</br>Part of both, I must confess.</br>Sel'd, yet for such causes small:</br>But I grieve not now at all.", "ROGET.</br>Why hath WILLY then so long</br>Thus forborne his wonted song?</br>Wherefore doth he now let fall,</br>His well-tuned Pastorall?</br>And my eares that Musicke barre,</br>Which I more long after farre</br>Than the liberty I want.", "WILLIE.</br>That were very much to grant.</br>But doth this hold alway lad,</br>Those that sing not must be sad?</br>Did'st thou ever that bird heare</br>Sing well, that sings all the yeare?</br>Tom the Piper doth not play</br>Till he weares his Pipe away:</br>Theres a time to slacke the string,</br>And a time to leave to sing.", "ROGET.</br>Yea, but no man now is still,</br>That can sing or tune a quill.</br>Now to chant it were but reason;</br>Song and Musicke are in season.</br>Now in this sweet jolly tide,</br>Is the earth in all her pride.</br>The fair Lady of the May</br>Trimm'd up in her best array</br>Hath invited all the Swaines</br>With the Lasses of the Plaines,</br>To attend upon her sport</br>At the places of resort.</br>Coridon (with his bold Rout)</br>Hath already been about</br>For the elder Shepheards dole:</br>And fetcht in the Summer-Pole;</br>Whilst the rest have built a Bower,</br>To defend them from a shower,</br>Seil'd so close with boughs all greene,</br>Tytan cannot pry betweene.</br>Now the Dayrie Wenches dreame</br>Of their Strawberries and Creame.</br>And each doth her selfe advance</br>To be taken in, to dance.</br>Every one that knows to sing,</br>Fits him for his Carrolling:</br>So doe those that hope for meede,</br>Either by the Pipe or Reed,</br>And though I am kept away,</br>I doe hear (this very day)</br>Many learned Groomes doe wend,</br>For the Garlands to contend</br>Which a Nymph that hight Desart,</br>(Long a stranger in this part)</br>With her owne faire hand hath wrought</br>A rare worke (they say) past thought,</br>As appeareth by the name,</br>For she calles them Wreathes of Fame.</br>She hath set in their due place</br>Every flower that may grace,</br>And among a thousand moe,</br>(Whereof some but serve for show)</br>She hath wove in Daphnes tree,</br>That they may not blasted bee.</br>Which with Time she edged about,</br>That it might not shatter out.</br>And that they might wither never,</br>Intermixt it with Live-ever.</br>These are to bee shared among</br>Those that do excell for song:</br>Or their passions can rehearse</br>In the smooth'st and sweetest verse.</br>Then for those among the rest</br>That can play and pipe the best,</br>There's a Kidling with the Damme,</br>A fat Weather, and a Lambe.</br>And for those that leapen farre,</br>Wrastle, Runne, and throw the Barre,</br>Ther's appointed guerdons too:</br>He that best the first can doe,</br>Shall for his reward, be paid</br>With a Sheepe-hooke, faire in-laid</br>With fine bone, of a strange beast</br>That men bring from out the west.</br>For the next, a Scrip of red,</br>Tassel'd with fine coloured thred.</br>Then for him that's quick'st of foote,</br>A Cup of turned Maple-roote:</br>Whereupon the skilfull man</br>Hath ingrav'd the Loves of Pan.</br>And the last hath for his due,</br>A fine Napkin wrought with blew.</br>Then my Willy what moves thee,</br>Thus forgetfull now to be?</br>What mak'st thou here with a wight</br>That is shut up from delight:</br>In a solitary den,</br>As not fit to live with men.</br>Go my Willy get thee gone,</br>Leave me in exile alone;</br>Hye thee to that merry throng,</br>And amaze them with thy Song.</br>Thou art yong, yet such a Lay</br>Never graced the month of May,</br>As (if they provoke thy skill)</br>Thou canst fit unto thy Quill.</br>I with wonder heard thee sing,</br>At our last yeares Revelling.</br>Then I with the rest was free,</br>When unknowne I noted thee:</br>And perceiv'd the ruder Swaines,</br>Envie thy farre sweeter straines.</br>Yea I saw the Lasses cling</br>Round about thee in a Ring:</br>As if each one jealous were,</br>Any but herselfe should heare.</br>And I know they yet do long</br>For the res'due of thy song.</br>Haste thee then to sing it forth,</br>Take the benefit of worth.</br>And Desert will sure bequeath</br>Fames faire garland for thy wreath.</br>Hye thee Willy, hye away.", "WILLIE.</br>Roget rather let me stay,</br>And be desolate with thee,</br>Than at those their Revels be;</br>Nought such is my skill I wis,</br>As indeed thou deem'st it is.</br>But what ere it be, I must</br>Be content, and shall, I trust.</br>For a song I doe not passe,</br>Mong'st my friends, but what (alas)</br>Should I have to doe with them</br>That my Musicke do contemne?</br>Some there are, as well I wot,</br>That the same yet favour not:</br>Yet I cannot well avow,</br>They my Carrols disallow.</br>But such malice I have spid,</br>Tis as much as if they did.", "ROGET.</br>Willy, what may those men be,</br>Are so ill to malice thee?", "WILLIE.</br>Some are worthy-well esteem'd,</br>Some without worth are so deem'd.</br>Others of so base a spirit,</br>They have nor esteeme, nor merit.", "ROGET.</br>What's the wrong?", "WILLIE.</br>A slight offence,</br>Wherewithall I can dispence;</br>But hereafter for their sake,</br>To myself I'le musicke make.", "ROGET.</br>What, because some Clowne offends,</br>Wilt thou punish all thy friends?", "WILLIE.</br>Honest Roget, understand me,</br>Those that love me may command me.</br>But thou know'st, I am but young,</br>And the Pastorall I sung,</br>Is by some suppos'd to bee</br>(By a straine) too high for me.</br>So they kindly let me gaine,</br>Not my labour, for my paine.</br>Trust me, I do wonder why</br>They should me my owne deny.</br>Though I'me yong, I scorne to flit</br>On the wings of borrowed wit.</br>I'le make my own feathers reare me</br>Whither others cannot beare me.</br>Yet I'le keep my skill in store,</br>Till I've seen some Winters more.", "ROGET.</br>But in earnest mean'st thou so?</br>Then thou art not wise, I trow.</br>Better shall advise thee Pan,</br>For thou dost not rightly than:</br>That's the ready way to blot</br>All the credit thou hast got.</br>Rather in thy Ages prime,</br>Get another start of Time:</br>And make those that so fond be,</br>(Spite of their owne dulnesse) see</br>That the sacred Muses can</br>Make a child in yeares, a man.</br>It is knowne what thou canst do,</br>For it is not long agoe,</br>When that CUDDY, Thou, and I,</br>Each the others skill to try,</br>At Saint Dunstanes charmed Well,</br>(As some present there can tell)</br>Sang upon a sudden Theame,</br>Sitting by the Crimson streame.</br>Where, if thou didst well or no,</br>Yet remaines the song to show.</br>Much experience more I've had,</br>Of thy skill (thou happy Lad)</br>And would make the world to know it,</br>But that time will further show it.</br>Envy makes their tongues now runne,</br>More than doubte of what is donne.</br>For that needs must be thy owne,</br>Or to be some other's knowne:</br>But how then willt suit unto</br>What thou shalt hereafter do?</br>Or I wonder where is hee,</br>Would with that song part to thee:</br>Nay, were there so mad a swaine,</br>Could such glory sell for gaine,</br>Phoebus would not have combin'd</br>That gift with so base a mind.</br>Never did the Nine impart</br>The sweet secrets of their Art</br>Unto any that did scorne</br>To have their faire Badge seen worne,</br>Therefore unto those that say,</br>Were they pleased to sing a Lay,</br>They could doo 't, and will not tho;</br>This I speake, for this I know:</br>None ere drunke the Thespian Spring,</br>And knew how, but he did sing.</br>For that once infus'd in man</br>Makes him shew't, doe what he can.</br>Nay, those that doe only sip,</br>Or but ev'n their fingers dip</br>In that sacred Fount (poore Elves)</br>Of that brood will show themselves;</br>Yea, in hope to get them fame,</br>They will speake though to their shame</br>Let those then at thee repine,</br>That by their wits measure thine.</br>Needs those Songs must be thine owne,</br>And that one day will be knowne,</br>The same imputation to,</br>I my selfe doe undergo:</br>But it will be knowne ere long,</br>I'me abus'd, and thou hast wrong,</br>Who at twice ten have sung more</br>Than some will doe at fourescore.</br>Cheere thee (honest Willy) then,</br>And begin thy song agen.", "WILLY.</br>Faine I would, but I do feare</br>When againe my Lines they heare,</br>If they yeeld they are my Rimes,</br>They will finde some other Crimes.</br>And 'tis no safe ventring by,</br>Where we see detraction lye.</br>For doe what I can, I doubt,</br>She will pick some quarrell out,</br>And I oft have heard defended,</br>Little said, is soone amended.", "ROGET.</br>See'st thou not in cleerest dayes</br>Oft thick fogges cloud Heavens rayes?</br>And the vapours that do breath</br>From the earths grosse womb beneath,</br>Seeme not to us with blacke steames,</br>To pollute the Sunnes bright beames,</br>And yet vanish into aire,</br>Leaving them (unblemisht) faire?</br>So (my Willy) shall it bee</br>With detractions breath and thee.</br>It shall never rise so hye,</br>As to staine thy Poesie.</br>Like the Sunne shee oft exhales</br>Vapours from each rot'nest vales;</br>But so much her power may doo,</br>That she can dissolve them too.</br>If thy verse do bravely tower,</br>As she makes wing, she gets power,</br>Yet the higher she doth sore,</br>Shee's affronted still the more:</br>Till she to the high'st hath past,</br>Then she rests with fame at last.</br>Let nought therefore thee affright,</br>But make forward in thy flight:</br>For if I could match thy Rime,</br>To the very starres I'd clime,</br>There begin againe and flye</br>Till I reach'd Aeternity.</br>But (alas) my Muse is slow:</br>For thy pace she flagges too low.</br>Yea, the more's her haplesse fate,</br>Her short wings were clipt of late,</br>And poore I, her fortune ruing,</br>Am my selfe put up a muing.</br>But if I my Cage can rid,</br>I'le flye where I never did.</br>And though for her sake I'me crost,</br>Though my best hopes I have lost,</br>And knew she would make my trouble</br>Ten times more than ten times double,</br>I would love and keep her toe</br>Spight of all the world could doe.</br>For though banisht from my flockes,</br>And confined within these rockes,</br>Here I waste away the light,</br>And consume the sullen Night,</br>She doth for my comfort stay,</br>And keepes many cares away.</br>Though I misse the flowry Fields,</br>With those sweetes the Spring-tide yeelds,</br>Though I may not see those Groves,</br>Where the shepheards chaunt their Loves,</br>And the Lasses more excell,</br>Than the sweet-voyc'd Philomel,</br>Though of all those pleasures past</br>Nothing now remaines at last,</br>But Remembrance (poore reliefe)</br>That more makes, than mends my griefe.</br>She's my minds companion still,</br>Maugre Envies evil will.</br>Whence she should be driven to,</br>Wert 't in mortals power to do.</br>She doth tell me where to borrow</br>Comfort in the midst of sorrow;</br>Makes the desolatest place</br>To her presence be a grace,</br>And the blackest discontents</br>Be her fairest ornaments.</br>In my former dayes of blisse,</br>Her divine thoughts taught me this,</br>That from everything I saw</br>I could some invention draw:</br>And raise pleasure to her hight,</br>Through the meanest object's sight.</br>By the murmur of a spring,</br>Or the least leaves rustling.</br>By a Dazie whose leaves spread</br>Shut when Tytan goes to bed,</br>Or a shady bush or tree,</br>She could more infuse in me,</br>Than all Natures beauties can,</br>In some other wiser man.</br>By her helpe I also now,</br>Make this churlish place allow</br>Somethings, that may sweeten gladnesse</br>In the very gall of sadnesse.</br>The dull loannesse, the blacke shade</br>That these hanging vaults have made,</br>The strange Musicke of the waves,</br>Beating on these hollow Caves.</br>This grim den which Rockes embosse,</br>Over-growne with eldest moss,</br>The rude portals that give light,</br>More to Terror then Delight.</br>This my Chamber of Neglect,</br>Wal'd about with Disrespect,</br>From all these, and this dull aire,</br>A fit object for Despaire,</br>Shee hath taught mee by her might</br>To draw comfort and delight.</br>Therefore thou best earthly blisse</br>I will cherish thee for this.</br>Poesy; thou sweet'st content</br>That e'er Heav'n to mortals lent.</br>Though they as a trifle leave thee</br>Whose dull thoughts cannot conceive thee</br>Though thou bee to them a scorne</br>That to nought but earth are borne:</br>Let my life no longer bee</br>Than I am in love with thee.</br>Though our wise ones call thee madnesse,</br>Let me never taste of gladnesse</br>If I love not thy mad'st fits</br>More than all their greatest wits.</br>And though some too seeming holy</br>Do account thy raptures folly:</br>Thou dost teach mee to contemne</br>What makes Knaves and Fooles of them.</br>Oh, high power!  that oft doth carry</br>Men above", "WILLIE.</br>Good Roget tarry,</br>I do feare thou wilt begone</br>Quite above my reach anon,</br>The kind flames of Poesy</br>Have now borne thy thoughts so high,</br>That they up in Heaven bee</br>And have quite forgotten mee.</br>Call thy selfe to minde againe</br>Are these Raptures for a Swaine,</br>That attends on lowly sheepe</br>And with simple heards doth keepe?", "ROGET.</br>Thankes my Willy, I had runne</br>Till that Time had lodg'd the Sunne,</br>If thou had'st not made mee stay;</br>But thy pardon here I pray.</br>Lov'd Apollo's sacred sire</br>Had rais'd up my spirits higher</br>Through the love of Poesy</br>Than indeed they use to flye.</br>But as I said, I say still,</br>If that I had Willi's skill</br>Envy nor Detraction's tongue,</br>Should ere make me leave my song,</br>But I'de sing it every day</br>Till they pin'd themselves away.</br>Be thou then advis'd in this</br>Which both just and fitting is,</br>Finish what thou hast begunne</br>Or at least still forward runne,</br>Haile and Thunder ill he'le beare</br>That a blast of wind doth feare:</br>And if words will thus affray thee,</br>Prithee how will deeds dismay thee?</br>Do not thinke so rathe a song</br>Can passe through the vulgar throng</br>And escape without a touch,</br>Or that they can hurt it much:</br>Frosts wee see do nip that thing</br>Which is forwardst in the Spring:</br>Yet at last for all such lets</br>Somewhat of the rest it gets:</br>And I'me sure that so maist thou;</br>Therefore, my kind Willy now,</br>Since thy folding time drawes on</br>And I see thou must bee gone,</br>I no more of this will say</br>Till we meete next holiday.</br>"]
