["\"Not with more haste the panting doe removes</br>To closer coverts, and more distant groves,</br>When on her haunts the prowling wolves encroach,</br>And tainted breezes tell the foe's approach,</br>Than Tuxa flies his Agathol to meet,</br>And lay his sylvan trophies at her feet.\"</br>Thus sang Gatuxa, 'mid the echoing grove,</br>While bending poplars learnt the tale of love.", "\"Oh!  happy morn, supremely blest,\" he cries,</br>\"When Agathol first met my ravish'd eyes:</br>'Twas on the day that joy unrival'd reigns,</br>And all the fair were gather'd on the plains,</br>When valiant Mingo led his bride away,</br>And laughing pleasure rul'd the festive day.", "\"But see!  she comes!  my Agathola comes!</br>How shines her forehead, and how slim her thumbs!</br>What heav'nly charms her tawny breasts unfold!</br>And neck more yellow than Peruvian gold!</br>High thro' her nose a painted feather hung,</br>Words, smooth as acorns, dropping from her tongue,</br>O'er her sleak form with decent care was spread,</br>A splendid blanket, strip'd with blue and red;</br>While bits of tin and brass upon her toes,</br>With melting clatter, tinkle as she goes.</br>But ah!  how fruitless are th' attempts to draw</br>A perfect 'semblance of my peerless squaw.", "\"Full long the nymph, by noblest motives sway'd,</br>Withstood my suit, while ling'ring in the shade;</br>But when bright glory rais'd the tribe to arms,</br>And all the forest rung with loud alarms,</br>She willing follow'd all the sultry day,</br>Nor weep'd, nor grumbled, at the tedious way;</br>And, urg'd by her, I drew the twanging blow</br>With tenfold ardor on the flying foe.\"</br>"]
