["There is an evening twilight of the heart,</br>When its wild passion-waves are lulled to rest,</br>And the eye sees life's fairy scenes depart,</br>As fades the daybeam in the rosy west.</br>'Tis with a nameless feeling of regret</br>We gaze upon them as they melt away,</br>And fondly would we bid them linger yet,</br>But Hope is round us with her angel lay,</br>Hailing afar some happier moonlight hour;</br>Dear are her whispers still, though lost their early power.", "In youth her cheek was crimsoned with her glow;</br>Her smile was loveliest then; her matin song</br>Was heaven's own music, and the note of woe</br>Was all unheard her sunny bowers among.</br>Life's little world of bliss was newly born;</br>We knew not, cared not, it was born to die,</br>Flushed with the cool breeze and the dews of morn,</br>With dancing heart we gazed on the pure sky,</br>And mocked the passing clouds that dimmed its blue,</br>Like our own sorrows then &mdash; as fleeting and as few.", "And manhood felt her sway too &mdash; on the eye,</br>Half realized, her early dreams burst bright,</br>Her promised bower of happiness seemed nigh,</br>Its days of joy, its vigils of delight;</br>And though at times might lower the thunder-storm,</br>And the red lightnings threaten, still the air</br>Was balmy with her breath and her loved form,</br>The rainbow of the heart was hovering there.</br>'Tis in life's noontide she is nearest seen,</br>Her wreath the summer flower, her robe of summer green.", "But though less dazzling in her twilight dress,</br>There's more of heaven's pure beam about her now;</br>That angel-smile of tranquil loveliness,</br>Which the heart worships, glowing on her brow;</br>That smile shall brighten the dim evening star</br>That points our destined tomb, nor e'er depart</br>Till the faint light of life is fled afar,</br>And hushed the last deep beating of the heart:</br>The meteor-bearer of our parting breath,</br>A moonbeam in the midnight cloud of death.</br>"]
