["'Twas morning and Mary arose,</br>Her stockings and garters put on;</br>Instinctively follow'd her nose,</br>And walk'd with her back to the Sun.", "She smil'd and the woods were illum'd,</br>She sigh'd and the vales were depress'd;</br>She breath'd and the air was perfum'd,</br>She frown'd and saw nature distress'd.", "She nodded &mdash; the tree nodded too,</br>She murmur'd, and so did the rill,</br>She wept, and the evening dew&mdash;</br>Fell in tears on the neighbouring hill.", "She stept and fair flow'rs sprang up,</br>She blush'd and the rose look'd more red,</br>She was hungry &mdash; she went home and supt,</br>She was tired, and so &mdash; went to bed.</br>"]
