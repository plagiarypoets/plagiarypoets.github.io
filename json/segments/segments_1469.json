["Genius of Albion, still 'tis thine</br>To wield the sceptre of the Main;</br>Ev'n tho th' embattled world combine</br>To wrest it, the attempt proves vain.</br>Firm as an adamantine rock,</br>Thy Naval Prowess meets the shock,</br>And hurls, indignant, the recoiling blow,</br>Aim'd at thy envied head, on the confounded Foe.", "Thy valiant Tars no dangers dread;</br>Still prompt to fly where Glory calls,</br>The canvas wing they proudly spread,</br>That wafts along thy Wooden Walls:</br>Nor castled streight, nor buoyless shoal,</br>Their dauntless ardour can controul;</br>Nor thund'ring batt'ries, whose tremendous roar</br>Ev'n shakes the solid frame of the resounding shore.", "O'er the wide surface of the Globe,</br>Under each pole, beneath each zone,</br>To realms of every hue and robe,</br>Thy Maritime Renown is known.</br>The trembling East, the humbled West,</br>Have oft thy matchless might confess'd;</br>And soon the truant North again shall melt</br>To mildness, since her sons have Nelson's vengeance felt.", "Yet still the soul of Pity shrinks</br>When the dread stroke ev'n Justice deals;</br>Upon the Widow's woes she thinks&mdash;</br>On all the hapless Orphan feels.</br>Amid the triumphs of the Brave</br>Death's sable flag is seen to wave;</br>And dire Misfortune mingles her alloy,</br>To damp, in many a heart, the cause of general joy!</br>"]
