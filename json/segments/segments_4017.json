["That hour of morn was now approaching near,</br>When belles and beaux in dishabille appear,</br>When beaux and belles o'er chat-inspiring tea</br>Combine to fix the fashions of the day;</br>'Twas then that on two sofa's lay reclin'd,</br>A pair of gentle swains in sorrow join'd:</br>Papillio this, and erst the gayest wight</br>That ever fluttered in a fair-one's sight;</br>Narcissus that, than whom the softest beau</br>No sweeter dimple on his cheek could shew:</br>But this no longer flutters round the fair,</br>That fills his dimple with a falling tear;</br>Their sorrow's source the following strains disclose,</br>For these Papillio sung, Narcissus those.", "PAPILLIO.</br>Alas!  poor Shock no more?  so short thy date?</br>Thy beauties might have hop'd a milder fate;</br>Could Celia's kisses no protection give?</br>Must Shock than vulgar dogs no longer live?</br>Now shake no more the collar, wont to deck</br>With glossy silver his more glossy neck?</br>No more for tea each morn on Celia wait,</br>Or cull the fav'rite morsel from her plate?</br>Ah no!  obdurate death has clos'd his eyes,</br>In Celia's parlour on a quilt he lies.", "NARCISSUS.</br>How oft, poor Shock, with thy endearing play,</br>Hath Celia chas'd the tedious hours away!</br>How oft, when her embroid'ring needle tir'd,</br>And sweet romances ceas'd to be admir'd,</br>When cards, nor company cou'd please the fair,</br>Nor her own killing charms employ her care,</br>How oft, have gloomy vapours seiz'd the maid,</br>In spite of salts, or harts horn's boasted aid!</br>But thy caresses, Shock, the gloom cou'd chase,</br>And call forth smiles, the sunshine of her face!", "PAPILLIO.</br>How oft, when I've to Celia visits paid,</br>And strove to shine before the lovely maid;</br>When I've admir'd the richness of her lace,</br>Or shewn which head-dress best became her face,</br>Describ'd how Daphne, last assembly, dress'd,</br>Whose silks were richest, and whose jewels best;</br>When thus my fund of wit I've talk'd away,</br>And knew not, for my life, what next to say,</br>To Shock I've turn'd (ah!  Shock, thou mak'st me own</br>What, but t' enhance thy worth, had ne'er been known)</br>I've turn'd and play'd with Shock, and that pretence</br>Hath hid, how oft, my barrenness of sense.", "NARCISSUS.</br>How oft, at visits, when enliv'ning chat,</br>And piquant repartee itself grew flat,</br>And mighty scandal lost her usual force,</br>How oft' a gen'ral silence has ensu'd,&mdash;</br>Till Shock has stirr'd, and tattle strait renew'd.</br>Thy witty pranks, poor Shock, have oft prevail'd,</br>Where fashions, repartee, and scandal fail'd.", "PAPILLIO.</br>Such Shocky was; then, who can paint the woes,</br>Poor Celia feels, such excellence to lose?</br>Extended on a couch the mourner lies,</br>With heart-sprung tears suffus'd her lovely eyes,</br>No longer flows in curling rings her hair,</br>Her dress neglected speaks her deep despair;</br>Here unregarded lies the rich brocade,</br>There Dresden lace in scatter'd heaps is laid;</br>Here the gilt China vase bestrews the floor,</br>While chidden Betty weeps without the door.", "NARCISSUS.</br>Cease, hapless fair, those tears, those sighs, repress,</br>Reflect how frail is human happiness;</br>Nought is exempt from fate, we all must die,</br>Nor dogs, nor lovers, destiny can fly.</br>Then let not Shock such pungent grief create,</br>Shock must have sometime died, or soon, or late;</br>Admit consolement, wipe each streaming eye,</br>Another Shocky shall his place supply.</br>Another Shock shall frisk in Celia's arms,</br>And joy returning brighten all her charms.</br>"]
