["Ah!  whither bright Phoebus so fast?</br>Why post it so quickly away?</br>To what distant climate such haste,</br>Great source, and sole Regent of day?", "The flowrets &mdash; not one now remains,</br>For gone is their life-beaming God;</br>Save daisies, a few on the plains,</br>That languish and droop on the clod.", "Dear vi'lets, your loss I bemoan,</br>But, destin'd by FATE was your doom;</br>My pinks, but for this were you blown,</br>And PHILLIS was fond of your bloom.", "Dispoil'd are the jessamines of green,</br>Their fragrance the woodbines have lost;</br>A rose-bud &mdash; not one to be seen,</br>Enchain'd lies the riv'let by frost.", "The blackbird's mellifluous notes,</br>No more from the thickets resound;</br>No linnets distend their sweet throats,</br>No songster of joy to be found.", "All, all seem in sadness to mourn,</br>Distorted and ransack'd the year;</br>But Phoebus, in sooth, will return,</br>And joy to illumine the sphere.", "So Man (for his date is no more)</br>Just passes, we sorrow a while;</br>The year of his life is but o'er,</br>And Mirth gives the pleasure-form'd smile.</br>"]
