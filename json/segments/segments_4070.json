["Hence foolish care, and sorrow vain!</br>Ye bring no meed but empty pain.</br>No more will I, like wand'ring sprite,</br>Haunt the lone silence of the night;</br>To seek in shades, and twilight groves,</br>Such thoughts as Melancholy loves.</br>For lo!  where, like a blushing bride,</br>Aurora leaves Tithonus' side;</br>In some close wood or cavern nigh,</br>To hide her from the Sun's bright eye.</br>While rising larks do blythely sing,</br>And, smiling meadows greet the Spring.</br>A thousand dew-bent flow'rs are seen</br>To raise their heads upon the green.</br>And sweetly ev'ry hill resounds,</br>With cry of hunters, and of hounds,</br>As if Diana's self were there</br>With all her Nymphs; a huntress fair.</br>And thro' the Erymanthan plain,</br>Or Cragus, led a virgin train.", "Nor less delightful to the ear,</br>A wand'ring river murmurs near;</br>Hearing the birds' first matin song,</br>Whose notes its echoing banks prolong;</br>Like that fam'd sea, which poets say,</br>Had heard Arion's softest lay,</br>And grew so ravish'd with the strain,</br>It gave his musick back again.</br>Still as he sang, the waters bore</br>A pleasing murmur to the shore.</br>\"He sang how breathing zephyrs blow,</br>O'er flow'ry cliffs, and vales below,</br>How happy are the rural swains,</br>That tread on green Arcadian plains.</br>And how in safe and peaceful glades,</br>Fond shepherds dance with smiling maids.\"", "Charm'd with the sound of his sweet lyre,</br>I emulate the Poet's fire;</br>I hail the shades and sacred groves,</br>Where many a bounding Dryad roves;</br>The stream round tufted willows bending,</br>Where shepherds gay their flocks are tending.</br>Or mountains blue, whose summits high</br>Seem mingled with the distant sky.</br>And then I mark old Ocean's tide,</br>With silver billows glitt'ring wide;</br>The white sails shining in the air,</br>The sea-mews screaming from afar.</br>And oft I hear the dashing oar,</br>And busy waves that spurn the shore;</br>Where the fisher leaves his home,</br>O'er the pathless deep to roam.", "Methought amidst a scene so gay,</br>'Twere well to let the fancy stray;</br>Once more recall departed times,</br>And wander into distant climes.</br>Sometimes from the rocky shore,</br>The morning gales sweet musick bore.</br>Such high and cheerful strains as flow</br>When Care has fled, and sable Woe;</br>And staid Contentment in their place</br>Is seen with ever-smiling face.</br>Then thought I of the Delian God,</br>Nine Muses waited on his nod;</br>While from Parnassus far away,</br>He on Thracian hills did stray;</br>What time great Jove enrag'd had driv'n</br>The culprit from a seat in Heav'n.</br>Admetus heard his Hind complain,</br>And wonder'd at the polish'd strain.</br>The neighb'ring nymphs and graces bound,</br>In list'ning circles stood around</br>A simple shepherd's tale to hear,</br>Nor deem'd Apollo was so near.", "Oft in gay trim, and conscious pride,</br>A freighted vessel stemm'd the tide;</br>And hail'd her native land again,</br>Safe from the dangers of the main.</br>Straight I saw in fancy rise,</br>Boundless view, and cloudless skies;</br>Such as bright Arabia knows,</br>Or Ganges' stream, that widely flows.</br>I heard the magic charm that plac'd</br>Fair castles on the desert waste;</br>Bade mystic forms appear in sight,</br>Or chang'd to day, the blackest night;</br>Bade tow'rs and gilded domes be seen,</br>Midst gardens, lakes, and pastures green.</br>With gorgeous halls, and banquets, where</br>High dames, and many a lovely fair,</br>Each with a baron by her side,</br>Gayly feast, in regal pride;</br>Till suddenly withdrawn the spell,</br>To ground the false enchantment fell.", "Next Fancy led me to the bow'rs,</br>Where poets pass their sacred hours.</br>To Lesbos isle where Sappho sung,</br>The vales, and streams, and woods among;</br>To where Anacreon fram'd his lay,</br>White laughing Graces round him play;</br>To Ida's top, that Venus loves,</br>To Eryx' sacred shades and groves.", "Thus soaring high, the milkmaid's strain</br>Has brought me to myself again.</br>The lowing cow, the cawing rook,</br>And bees that seek you flow'ry nook;</br>The whistling ploughman, broke the charm,</br>And leave me now to pleasures calm.</br>So far my guided wings have flown,</br>They dare not tempt a path unknown.</br>Nor can I, thanks to thee, refuse,</br>(Of all the nymphs, my only muse)</br>Thee, Fancy!  careless, pleasing guest,</br>That giv'st to all our joys a zest;</br>And might I ever thus be free</br>In rural shades to live with thee,</br>No gems that shine on foreign coasts,</br>Nor all the wealth that India boasts;</br>Nor all the honours, pomp, and state,</br>That love to smile upon the great;</br>Should tempt me from the humble cell,</br>Where peace, and modest silence dwell.</br>"]
