["While POPE to Friendship consecrates the Lyre,</br>The Loves to hear the Notes assembled throng:</br>And with the softness of renew'd desire,</br>Inflame the dear re-animated Song:</br>Unrivall'd Bard! &mdash; the kindly task forbear,</br>The Youth before had worth enough to boast;</br>You ORPHEUS-like, but raise the Syren air;</br>The British Nymphs approach! &mdash; Your Friend is lost.</br>Hard fate!  a praise so wish'd as yours to shun,</br>Or by the fair Encomium risque to be undone.", "But oh I err! &mdash; and M&mdash;Y must forgive</br>A fame that brings such unexampled bliss.</br>To love is sure the noblest way to live:</br>Grandeur and wealth are toys compar'd to this.</br>Descend, dear Youth!  the shining guest await;</br>For beauty's Queen the roseate bower prepare:</br>Let her gay smiles adorn thy rising fate,</br>And soften all the pomp of future care:</br>And, like ADONIS, boast the envy'd pow'r,</br>To charm the wise and fair &mdash; which POPE must charm no more.</br>"]
