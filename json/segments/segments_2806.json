["I. 1.</br>Say, will the Lyric Muse</br>The themes of tender love refuse?</br>Though she with haughty state presides</br>Over the big tumultuous tides,</br>Which down the sacred mountain pour,</br>And stun the ear with deafening roar;</br>Yet where more gentle currents stray,</br>And through the flowery vallies play,</br>Laughing with transport as they flow,</br>Where roses and where myrtles grow,</br>She has e'er now been often found</br>To scatter her enchanting blessings round.", "I. 2.</br>Long in the Grecian isles,</br>Retain'd by Cytheraea's smiles,</br>Enamour'd of her rosy hue,</br>While frolic pleasures round her flew,</br>Stole from her lips the nectar'd kiss,</br>And bath'd their light-plum'd wings in bliss;</br>While Hebe danc'd with graceful tread,</br>And the soft airs, and passions led;</br>While sallying from her temple's porch,</br>Young Love wav'd high his magic torch,</br>Thou too with sweetest look appear'd,</br>And often thy melodious voice was heard.", "I. 3.</br>Hast thou forgot the melting strain</br>Which taught by thee thy Sappho sung,</br>When stretch'd upon the Lesbian plain,</br>O'er her the form of tender Pity hung?</br>Didst thou not bountifully shed</br>Thy visions o'er Anacreon's head?</br>And e'en the frozen breast of age,</br>In amorous nets and toils engage,</br>While all the virgins wondering stood,</br>And laugh'd, yet found themselves subdu'd?</br>And when he immaturely died,</br>Say, did not Grief thy heavenly beauties hide?", "II. 1.</br>On what wide-seated shore</br>Do mortals now thy name adore,</br>Celestial Love?  Thy haunts of old,</br>What clouds of darkness now enfold,</br>Instead of the pure incense bright,</br>Which then diffus'd a genial light!</br>Within th' incircled Haram reign</br>Tyrannic Lust, and jealous Pain,</br>Bitter Constraint, internal Fears,</br>Lean Anguish, and corroding Cares;</br>Unknown are there the mutual sighs</br>Which from the sympathetic breast arise.", "II. 2.</br>Thy more than human mien</br>By Tiber has of yore been seen;</br>And ere the Roman eagle flew</br>The sons of Britain to subdue,</br>With native Innocence allied,</br>Haply thy power did there reside:</br>But big with plentitude of woes,</br>From the rank earth a pest arose;</br>Nature his shape with grief espied,</br>And for her death-doom'd offspring sigh'd;</br>They sunk beneath, an easy prey,</br>And Love fled far from Avarice away.", "II. 3.</br>Didst thou then seek Columbia's strand,</br>There thy propitious forehead shew,</br>While rais'd by thy creative hand,</br>The blooming flowers of social rapture grew?</br>Too short a time, alas!  from thence</br>Didst thou thy radiant gifts dispense:</br>Behold, th' impetuous monster haste,</br>Rapine, and Violence, and Waste,</br>Follow attendant on his flight:</br>And lo, before thy pitying sight,</br>Welt'ring in blood thy people lies,</br>To cursed gold the fated sacrifice.", "III. 1.</br>By force exil'd, ah!  where</br>Did thy insulted steps repair!</br>Some island in the southern main,</br>Perhaps enjoy'd thy bounteous reign;</br>Or didst thou steer thy vagrant course</br>To Orellana's distant source?</br>There while in artlessness array'd,</br>The youth beholds his sun-burnt maid;</br>There while of every wish possest,</br>He leans with fondness on her breast,</br>Thou seest them in the palmy grove,</br>And o'er their heads thy purple pinions move.", "III. 2.</br>There too the heavenly Muse</br>Showers perchance her kindly dews,</br>While thus some Indian Horace sings,</br>As to his love he strikes the strings.</br>\"Ah, when you praise my rival's charms,</br>His jetty neck, and sable arms,</br>With passion swells my fervid breast,</br>With passion hard to be supprest:</br>My senses float in terrors vain,</br>My blood retreats, and comes again;</br>The tears steal down my cheeks, and say,</br>With what slow fires I totally decay.\"", "III. 3.</br>Oh, if with me, ye gentle powers,</br>Ye sometimes would but deign to dwell,</br>Born by the quickly-circling hours,</br>If ye would visit my sequester'd cell:</br>One who with purest passion glows,</br>Who not the face of Avarice knows,</br>Nor by Ambition drawn aside,</br>But owning Nature for his guide;</br>Who from his earliest day of youth,</br>Confess'd her charms, and worshipp'd Truth;</br>Ye in that secret cell should find,</br>And subject to your laws, a willing mind.</br>"]
