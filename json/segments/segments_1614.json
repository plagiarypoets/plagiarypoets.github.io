["Thou spectre of terrific mien,</br>Lord of the hopeless heart and hollow eye,</br>In whose fierce train each form is seen</br>That drives sick Reason to insanity!</br>I woo thee with unusual prayer,</br>\"Grim-visaged, comfortless Despair:\"</br>Approach; in me a willing victim find,</br>Who seeks thine iron sway &mdash; and calls thee kind!", "Ah!  hide for ever from my sight</br>The faithless flatterer Hope &mdash; whose pencil, gay,</br>Portrays some vision of delight,</br>Then bids the fairy tablet fade away;</br>While in dire contrast, to mine eyes</br>Thy phantoms, yet more hideous, rise,</br>And Memory draws, from Pleasure's wither'd flower,</br>Corrosives for the heart &mdash; of fatal power!", "I bid the traitor Love, adieu!</br>Who to this fond, believing bosom came,</br>A guest insidious and untrue,</br>With Pity's soothing voice &mdash; in Friendship's name.</br>The wounds he gave, nor Time shall cure,</br>Nor Reason teach me to endure.</br>And to that breast mild Patience pleads in vain,</br>Which feels the curse &mdash; of meriting its pain.", "Yet not to me, tremendous power!</br>Thy worst of spirit-wounding pangs impart,</br>With which, in dark conviction's hour,</br>Thou strik'st the guilty unrepentant heart!</br>But, of illusion long the sport,</br>That dreary, tranquil gloom I court,</br>Where my past errors I may still deplore,</br>And dream of long-lost happiness no more!", "To thee I give this tortured breast,</br>Where Hope arises but to foster pain;</br>Ah!  lull its agonies to rest!</br>Ah!  let me never be deceiv'd again!</br>But callous, in thy deep repose</br>Behold, in long array, the woes</br>Of the dread future, calm and undismay'd,</br>Till I may claim the hope &mdash; that shall not fade!</br>"]
