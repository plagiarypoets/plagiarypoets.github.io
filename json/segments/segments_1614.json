["Ye Cliffs, that echo to Gaul's iron tread,</br>Ye Hills, whose soft turf bears the English train,</br>Ye Gales, whose spirit-stirring breath can spread</br>The bannerets of Liberty and Spain;</br>Say, can ye now resound the peaceful strain,</br>Such as ye wont, wild and irregular,</br>When the sweet pipe came soften'd o'er the plain,</br>Or lightly mingled with the gay guitar!</br>Can you such notes resound &mdash; or are they drown'd in War?", "I sing, not I, of battles bravely won;</br>Not mine the \"verse of tumult and of flame\"</br>That tells the deeds of gallant Wellington,</br>Or consecrates the glories of the Graeme.</br>I sing them not &mdash; nor though one honor'd name</br>Woke not of Albyn's bard the peerless string,</br>Moore, be thy life, thy death, a better fame</br>Than the low dirge that, faintly carolling,</br>My feeble lyre could breathe, my weaker voice could sing!", "Not for such lofty strain I seek thy strand,</br>Romantic Spain!  'Tis but to while away</br>The lingering hours in Fancy's fairy land,</br>And frame wild fictions of thy elder day:</br>Now the sad vision chace, now own its sway,</br>Tho' variable, as the fitful dream</br>Of brain-sick fever, the capricious lay:</br>Change to the subject suited well, I deem,</br>For Woman's is the song, and Woman is the theme.</br>"]
