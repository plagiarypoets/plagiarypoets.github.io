["Erst in Arcadia's londe much prais'd was found</br>A lustie tree far rearing t'ward the skies,</br>Sacred to Jove, and placed on high grounde,</br>Beneath whose shade did gladsome shepherds hie,</br>Met plenteous good, and oft were wont to shunne</br>Bleak winters drizzle, summer's parching sunne.", "Outstretch'd in all the luxurie of ease,</br>They pluck'd rich misletoe of virtue rare;</br>Their lippe was tempted by each kindlie breeze,</br>That wav'd the branch to proffer acorns fair;</br>While out the hollow'd root, with sweets inlaide,</br>The murm'ring bee her daintie hoard betrayde.", "The fearless bird safe bosom'd here its neste,</br>Its sturdie side did brave the nipping winde,</br>Where many a creeping ewe mought gladlie reste;</br>Warme comforte here to all and ev'ry kinde;</br>Where hunge the leafe well sprint with honey dew,</br>Whence dropt their cups, the gamboling fairie knew.", "But ah!  in luckless day what mischief 'gan</br>'Midst fell debate, and madd'ning revelrie,</br>When tipsie Bacchus had bewitched Pan,</br>For sober swain so thankless ne'er mought be;</br>Tho' passinge strange &mdash; 'twas bruited all arounde,</br>This goodlie tree did shadowe too much grounde.", "With much despight they aim its overthrow,</br>And sorrie jestes its wonted giftes deride,</br>How 'snaring birdlimes made of misletoe;</br>Nor trust their flocks to shelter 'neath its side;</br>It drops chill venom on our ewes, they cry,</br>And subtle serpent at its root doth lie.", "Eftsoons the axe doth rear its deadlie blowe,</br>Arounde doth eccho bear each labouringe stroke;</br>Now to the grounde its loftie head doth bowe,</br>Then angry Jove aloud in thunder spoke.</br>On high Olympus next mine tree I'll place,</br>Heaven's still unscann'd by sich ungrateful race.</br>"]
