["Hard is the life when naked and unhouzed</br>And wasted by the long day's fruitless pains,</br>The hungry savage, 'mid deep forests, rouzed</br>By storms, lies down at night on unknown plains</br>And lifts his head in fear, while famished trains</br>Of boars along the crashing forests prowl,</br>And heard in darkness, as the rushing rains</br>Put out his watch-fire, bears contending growl</br>And round his fenceless bed gaunt wolves in armies howl.", "Yet is he strong to suffer, and his mind</br>Encounters all his evils unsubdued;</br>For happier days since at the breast he pined</br>He never knew, and when by foes pursued</br>With life he scarce has reached the fortress rude,</br>While with the war-song's peal the valleys shake,</br>What in those wild assemblies has he viewed</br>But men who all of his hard lot partake,</br>Repose in the same fear, to the same toil awake?", "The thoughts which bow the kindly spirits down</br>And break the springs of joy, their deadly weight</br>Drive from memory of pleasures flown</br>Which haunts us in some sad reverie of fate,</br>Or from reflection on the state</br>Of those who on the couch of Affluence rest</br>By laughing Fortune's sparkling cup elate,</br>While we of comfort rest, by pain depressed,</br>No other pillow know than Penury's iron breast.", "Hence where Refinement's genial influence calls</br>The soft affections from their wintry sleep</br>And the sweet tear of Love and Friendship falls</br>The willing heart in tender joy to steep,</br>When men in various vessels roam the deep</br>Of social life, and turns of chance prevail</br>Various and sad, how many thousands weep</br>Beset with foes more fierce than e'er assail</br>The savage without home in winter's keenest gale.", "The troubled west was red with stormy fire,</br>O'er Sarum's plain the traveller with a sigh</br>Measured each painful step, the distant spire</br>That fixed at every turn his backward eye</br>Was lost, tho' still he turned, in the blank sky.</br>By thirst and hunger pressed he gazed around</br>And scarce could any trace of man descry,</br>Save wastes of corn that stretched without a bound,</br>But where the sower dwelt was nowhere to be found. . . .</br>"]
