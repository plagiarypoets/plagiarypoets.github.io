["When bold Columbus, o'er th' Atlantic Main,</br>To fabled Climes his daring Sail unfurl'd,</br>And now prepar'd the wondrous Strand to gain;</br>Uprose the Genius of the western World:</br>Bright to the Sun his feathery Crown display'd</br>A thousand Hues, high-beaming o'er his Head;</br>Some wisard Hand his barbarous Robe portray'd,</br>Where Cities blaz'd, and Montezuma bled:</br>As stern he trod, his Giant-quiver rung,</br>And thus to Seas and Shores prophetic Sounds he sung.", "My Spicy Groves in vain old Ocean hides</br>Far in the Bosom of his Billows hoar;</br>Mid the vast Barrier of surrounding Tides,</br>In vain my Mountains flame with latent Ore:</br>In dark Retirements of my trackless Shades</br>Though Nature holds at large her lonely Reign,</br>Her deep Repose rash Avarice invades;</br>I mark the Rapine of the Slaves of Gain,</br>Hear with new Din my pine-capt Caverns roar,</br>And see my Cataracts unseemly stream with Gore.", "Yet deem not, Strangers, that in happy Hour</br>Ye stem by Bays sequester'd.  Conquest new</br>Shall shake by turns each proud Usurper's Power:</br>Nor breathe my Groves, nor glow my Mines for you.</br>What though, with many a Shriek, and dismal Yell,</br>My quiver'd Gods with Bows of Ebon break;</br>And specious Arts, from Den, or leafy Cell,</br>At length must lure my guiless Natives meek?</br>Yet Heaven to distant Times the Wreath ordains</br>Of Him whose final Sway shall claim my destin'd Plains.", "Lo, then whate'er old Bards, in mystic Lore,</br>Of Regions blest, Hesperian Coasts, have told,</br>In me shall be reveal'd.  From Shore to Shore,</br>From Pole to Pole, one Empire I behold!</br>From Albion's Cliffs a mighty King shall send</br>Secure Dominion:  mid the brave Career,</br>Howe'er to Death his honoured Eld descend,</br>A youthful Prince shall seize his massy Spear,</br>Shall rise his Grandsire's conquering Race to run,</br>To rule, to bless, the Realms the hoary Warriour won.</br>"]
