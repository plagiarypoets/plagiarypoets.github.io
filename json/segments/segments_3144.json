["To thee, who mindful of the Poet's fame,</br>Dost in these lines his vagaries peruse,</br>Hast curiosity to ask his name,</br>And taste and feeling to respect his muse,&mdash;", "A dark eyed lass in Common-street may say,</br>\"Often we see him, and to-morrow shall,</br>Brushing, with rapid step, the leaves away,</br>To meet Miss H&mdash; walking in the mall.", "There in the front of yonder garden gates,</br>Whistling \"Love wakes and weeps,\" with solemn eye,</br>And monumental patience, oft he waits,</br>And pores upon the Belles that babble by.", "For who, to cold indifference a prey,</br>Visions like these without a sigh resign'd,</br>Or passed such lovely specimens of clay,</br>Nor cast one LONGING lingering look behind?", "Some Lavalette in yonder pretty lass,</br>May be concealed &mdash; who may as faithful prove;</br>Some mute and songless Sappho there may pass,</br>Some Cleopatra, chaste, yet ALL for love.</br>CETERA DESUNT.</br>"]
