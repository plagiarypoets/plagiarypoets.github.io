["Tho' mute be thy Corydon's lyre,</br>Tho' the laurel may fade on his brow,</br>Tho' fancy has nought to inspire,</br>Yet Friendship can harmonize woe.</br>She may sweetly partake of our grief,</br>Ah!  may sooth even beauty's alarm;</br>But for love she can find no relief,</br>Not the softness of friendship can charm.", "Forgotten be Corydon's prize,</br>Which he bore from the swains of the grove;</br>Nay, forgotten be Phyllida's eyes,</br>Forgotten be all but my love.</br>My Pipe I have left on the plain,</br>My song is no longer my care;</br>But, alas!  that increases my pain,</br>For music would sadden despair.", "If a sigh should escape from my heart,</br>Or a blush should illumine my cheek,</br>Believe me, 'tis only that part</br>Which utt'rance refuses to speak.</br>Then seek not to stifle my woe,</br>Away your fond counsel remove;</br>You would cause, if a tear you bestow,</br>A tear both for friendship and love.", "For ever must Corydon burn,</br>Let him fly to some far distant sphere,</br>Where his passion may never return,</br>To torture his Phyllida's ear.</br>Retirement must mark out the spot,</br>Contentment must smile thro' the wild,</br>Sweet peace must inhabit the cot,</br>And happiness health's rosy child.", "Thus retir'd from the world and its cares,</br>May Eternity compass my thoughts,</br>Some comfort may bless my grey hairs,</br>While I smile at my juvenile faults.</br>May my soul when requir'd by my God,</br>In that state it first sunk from the sky,</br>As it bows to the Deity's nod,</br>Expand its bright plumage and fly.</br>"]
