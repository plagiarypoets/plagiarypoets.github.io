["Build'st thou on Wealth? &mdash; its wings are ever spread,</br>Its trusting votaries to elude and foil;&mdash;</br>On Science? &mdash; see!  his favourite sons have fled,</br>Like the pale lamp that lit their midnight toil,</br>Forgotten as the flower that deck'd the vernal soil.", "Build'st thou on Love? &mdash; the simple heart it cheers,</br>When high in health, and all around is gay,</br>Yet leads to folly, vanity, and tears;&mdash;</br>Build'st thou on Fame? &mdash; the dancing meteor's ray</br>Glides not more swift, more unperceived away.", "Ah!  why on sands like these thy temple rear?</br>How shall its base the storms and billows shun!</br>Seek the Eternal Rock with humble fear,</br>And on the tablet of each setting sun</br>Grave with a diamond's point, some deed of duty done.", "If thou art young &mdash; the words of wisdom weigh,</br>Mature &mdash; the gathering ills of life beware,</br>Aged &mdash; Oh, make This mighty arm thy stay,</br>Who saves the weakest suppliant from despair,</br>And bids the darken'd tomb a robe of glory wear.</br>"]
