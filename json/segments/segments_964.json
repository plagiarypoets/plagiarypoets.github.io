["But where shall now the daring Muse</br>That rich exhaustless treasure find,</br>Of lively, warm, and brilliant hues,</br>Where strength with beauty dwells combin'd,</br>To paint those glorious visions of delight,</br>Which met within the walls my ravish'd sight?", "Could I that pencil's force command,</br>Which once pourtray'd ALCINA'S land;</br>Or his, who taught the song to rove</br>Through fair ARMIDA'S magic grove;</br>Or his, who paints ACRASIA'S wanton bow'r,</br>And decks the charming spot with ev'ry fairy flow'r.", "Had I that bold seraphic tongue,</br>Which youthful EDEN'S glories sung;</br>Or his, whose heroes rest from toil</br>In CYTHEREA'S verdant isle,</br>Who wanders wild thro' Pleasure's flow'ry plain,</br>And bathes in passion deep the rich voluptuous strain:", "Then might I hope, with happier hand, to draw</br>Some faint resemblance of the scenes I saw;</br>Tho' still the picture would be far behind</br>The bright conception of the painter's mind,</br>Which these artificers of tuneful speech,</br>With all their varied skill, would fail to reach.</br>At first the glare of bliss was too intense</br>For mortal strength, and each bewilder'd sense</br>Sunk lifeless down before the plastic pow'rs</br>That reign'd eternal in those fairy bow'rs,</br>Whose magic there on ev'ry object threw</br>The dazzling light of Beauty's brilliant hue;</br>And fill'd the wanton airy that danc'd around,</br>With charming odour and delightful sound.</br>But who can tell the pride of fragrant bow'rs,</br>The rich profusion of immortal flow'rs;</br>The crystal streams that sweetly flow'd along,</br>And o'er their pebbles made melodious song;</br>The painted tribes that, perch'd on ev'ry spray,</br>Attun'd their notes to love's harmonious lay?</br>There still did smiling Summer's golden eye</br>Look down propitious from a cloudless sky;</br>There to the charm of Spring's ambrosial pow'r</br>Was join'd the boast of Autumn's wealthy dow'r,</br>Who there, for ever ripe, yet ever young,</br>On each fair tree in purple triumph hung;</br>There still with dewy step the gentle dawn</br>Mov'd o'er the verdure of the glossy lawn;</br>And there, with influence meek, and sober grace,</br>Still bath'd in coolness Nature's smiling face;</br>Nor e'er allow'd the splendid orb of day</br>To lift above the hills his glaring ray,</br>And drive, with flaming torch, the peaceful morn away.", "Now had mine eyes these charms at leisure view'd,</br>And thus the gracious Pow'r his speech renew'd:&mdash;", "\"What here, my son, thy wonder sees around,</br>Makes but one province of my fairy ground;</br>But one of five, which form a finish'd whole,</br>And yet with diff'rent beauties charm the soul.</br>Full in the midst of this extensive plain,</br>Where Fate's command has fixt my splendid reign.</br>Appears that MOUNTAIN of immortal fame,</br>Which bears SUBLIMITY'S exalted name;</br>From which enchanting PITY'S VALE descends,</br>And to the South its shadowy length extends;</br>While to the North, when round the mount you roam,</br>You meet with RIDICULE'S capricious DOME:</br>But in the sea which bathes its western side</br>Lies FANCY'S ISLE, in wild romantic pride;</br>And here, where now you breathe ambrosial air,</br>East of the Mount, is BEAUTY'S GARDEN rare.</br>In all these scenes are diff'rent seats assign'd</br>For diff'rent orders of the tuneful mind,</br>Who, while their hours in endless rapture flow,</br>Forget the hardships they endur'd below.</br>These fair abodes, at leisure now to view,</br>Let us, with heedful steps, our course pursue;</br>Nor will my vocal aid be needful here</br>To point them out, as they by turns appear;</br>Since well thy curious eye has known so long</br>The various features of the sons of song,</br>That one slight glance will bring to Mem'ry's view</br>Their name, their genius, and the scenes they drew.\"&mdash;", "He spoke, and mov'd &mdash; nor did my eager mind,</br>By sloth or fear discourag'd, lag behind.&mdash;</br>And now, what first of all our notice drew,</br>And with its gentle beauty cheer'd the view,</br>Was a rich spot of gayest freshness green,</br>In midst of which a silver fount was seen,</br>The floating surface of whose mirror bright</br>Reflected back the images of sight,</br>And show'd each pebble small in clear display,</br>Whose sparkling smoothness at the bottom lay;</br>Its velvet bank no foot could e'er forsake,</br>Until his lips had touch'd the limpid lake,</br>So sweet the murmur of its tinkling sound,</br>And such the coolness which it breath'd around.</br>There sate the slave, whose pow'rs from AFRIC'S shore</br>To ROME'S proud walls her better Genius bore,</br>And taught him there, with Freedom's flowing vein,</br>To pour translucent forth his comic strain.</br>And there, in negligent but neat array,</br>The gay FONTAINE in opposition lay:</br>Unrivall'd Bard, whose fame o'er all prevails</br>For simple apologues and comic tales;</br>Around their Poet still, without dismay,</br>Frisk'd all the brutal tribes in wanton play,</br>And at his feet his darling Reynard lay.</br>There both enjoy'd that richest bliss refin'd,</br>Which feeling souls an earth so rarely find,</br>When mind congenial meets congenial mind.</br>Oft bending down, with amiable grace,</br>Each view'd with pleasure his reflected face;</br>And oft the GALLIC Bard, in sportive mood,</br>Made playful eddies in the circling flood,</br>But went at times too far, and dim'd its waves with mud.", "From thence not far a charming bank was seen,</br>Cloth'd in the brightness of eternal green,</br>O'er which the beech its rustic umbrage hung,</br>And flow'rs from which in wild profusion sprung;</br>Not those, whose gaudy pomp the wearied gaze</br>With more of wonder than delight surveys;</br>But those whose simple and unmingled hues</br>Each eye with calm and constant pleasure views;</br>The golden crocus and the violet pale,</br>The sweet narcissus that embalms the gale,</br>And gentle primrose buds, the pride of ev'ry vale.</br>There wanton kids skipp'd o'er the glossy ground,</br>And lambs in frolic measures danc'd around;</br>And there, on Nature's couch extended, lay</br>The two great Masters of the rural lay;</br>That ancient Bard, who, made SICILIA'S plains</br>Resound the sweetness of his DORIC strains;</br>And he who fill'd the groves, erewhile so mute,</br>With the sweet echoes of his SAXON flute;</br>Who to the verse in measur'd pomp that flows,</br>Preferr'd the humbler garb of graceful prose:</br>And yet the GREEK foregoes his tuneful claim,</br>And yields HELVETIA'S Son the palm of fame;</br>Gladly he bows to that superior mind,</br>Whose matchless art his darling Muse refin'd;</br>Who bade her move with more majeftic pace,</br>With more bewitching softness fill'd her face,</br>And deck'd her simple form with more attractive grace.", "Still onward led by Taste's indulgent pow'r,</br>I next beheld a gay delightful bow'r,</br>O'er which with lavish pomp the mantling vine</br>Spread the rich umbrage of its fruit divine;</br>And where around, each purple swarm between,</br>The fragrant myrtle wreath'd its brilliant green;</br>There, gaily perch'd the rustic arch above,</br>Sate the two birds of frolic and of love,</br>The wanton sparrow here, and there the gentle dove.</br>Within the bow'r, by equal taste conjoin'd,</br>Two jocund minstrels lay, at ease reclin'd;</br>The sprightly Sage from TEOS' winding shore,</br>And LESBIA'S Bard, whom proud VERONA bore;</br>The tuneful teachers both of soft desire,</br>And matchless masters of the sportive lyre:</br>The GREEK rehears'd, in many a liquid line,</br>The charms of beauty, and the joys of wine;</br>While the sweet ROMAN'S more voluptuous tongue,</br>Of countless stars, and countless kisses sung:</br>Soft were the notes, to youthful Fancy dear,</br>And tho' condemn'd by Reason's voice severe,</br>They charm'd the feeling heart, and sooth'd the tuneful ear.", "The bow'r was left; and o'er a wide expanse,</br>In liveliest verdure drest, we next advance;</br>Its length delightful reach'd a river's side,</br>Whose distant waves in silence seem'd to glide;</br>As velvet smooth appear'd the level green,</br>In which no rough rebellious tuft was seen,</br>So quick the scythe each rising growth destroy'd,</br>And the round roller was so much employ'd.</br>While this refreshing scene engag'd mine eye,</br>Four gentle knights came softly riding by,</br>Each mounted on a well-proportion'd steed,</br>Of those ARABIA'S fertile pastures breed:</br>Adown their sides no tinsel trappings hung,</br>Nor cloth of gold a gaudy lustre flung;</br>Their pride was steel alone, whose polish'd hue</br>Around their steps a sober glory threw;</br>His courser each with graceful ease bestrode,</br>And o'er the plain in gentlest measure rode.</br>The first was he, whose comprehensive mind</br>At once the warrior and the sage combin'd;</br>Whose sweet  but simple page records so well</br>The luckless field where youthful CYRUS fell,</br>And all those toils the brave Ten Thousand bore,</br>Before they reach'd again their native shore.</br>Next was the man on whose mellifluous tongue</br>Assembled ROME so oft with rapture hung,</br>And who conjoin'd with sweet Persuasion's pow'r</br>The boast of Wisdom's philosophic dow'r.</br>The third, in rank of time, was BRITAIN'S Sage.</br>Who fill'd with purest truth his moral page,</br>And brought, in Diction's loveliest robe array'd,</br>His charming CLIO forth to Virtue's aid.</br>And last appear'd the Prince of GALLIC prose,</br>Who shun'd in FERNEY'S shades his bigot foes;</br>Whose daring head with ev'ry wreath was crown'd,</br>But most triumphant on historic ground.", "But now the glorious cavalcade was past,</br>And we the distant river gain'd at last,</br>To which no torrent gave unwonted force,</br>Nor rugged rock detain'd its gentle course,</br>But smooth as glass the peaceful waves appear,</br>For ever silent, and for ever clear.</br>Across the stream one simple arch was flung,</br>And o'er the flood in slender beauty hung,</br>Full in the midst of which we paus'd awhile,</br>And turning to the left beheld an isle&mdash;</br>A charming isle &mdash; which, tho' of smallest size,</br>Yet fix'd, and long detain'd our wond'ring eyes:</br>For lavish Nature had assembled there</br>Whate'er was costly, brilliant, rich, and rare;</br>With sweet reluctance there the bashful rose</br>Appear'd her virgin beauties to disclose,</br>While the bold tulip, flaunting by her side,</br>Display'd, unask'd, her many-colour'd pride;</br>There too the orange spread its golden bloom,</br>And fill'd the circling air with rich perfume;</br>And there the gorgeous peacock, proud and vain,</br>Show'd the broad splendor of his starry train:</br>Two graceful swans, in purest white array'd,</br>Around the isle their silver circuit made,</br>And IRIS over all, for ever young,</br>Her bright unfading arch of glory flung.</br>In this delicious spot, by Fate confin'd,</br>Past their sweet hours two TUSCAN Bards refin'd:</br>The man who first array'd in tragic hues.</br>The simple features of the Past'ral Muse,</br>And raising next his voice to wars alarms,</br>Sung the success of GODFREY'S pious arms,</br>And TANCRED'S luckless love, and fair ARMIDA'S charms.</br>He too was there, who taught his FAITHFUL SWAIN</br>A language foreign to the rural plain;</br>And whose refinement deck'd each brilliant part</br>With much of nature, but with more of art,</br>Which always charm'd the ear, and sometimes reach'd the heart.", "Now from the isle our wearied eyes withdrew,</br>And up the river bent their alter'd view;</br>Where a rich barge came slowly down the stream,</br>And ting'd the water with a golden gleam;</br>A barge in Art's most elegant array,</br>With burnish'd Prow, and purple streamers gay,</br>All but the topmost flag, whose sable hues</br>Confest the liv'ry of the Tragic Muse.  </br>The painted oars two tender Poets plied,</br>And cut with graceful ease, the silver tide;</br>The GALLIC stage's boast, whose classic mind</br>To purest chastity his verse refin'd;</br>Who wretched PHEDRA'S guilty flame pourtray'd,</br>And DIAN'S victim sung, the hapless maid</br>By her reluctant fire's ambitious pride betray'd:</br>And he whose magic brought, in strains divine,</br>Where harmony attunes each golden line,</br>The fate of SHORE'S unhappy wife to view,</br>And fair CALISTA'S vain repentance drew.", "Thus long reposing on the bridge we stood,</br>Which now we past, and reach'd a pleasant wood,</br>Compos'd of ev'ry various race of trees,</br>Whose size or shape the judging eye could please;</br>But chief the graceful larch and poplar tall</br>Profusely rose, and overtopt them all.</br>Shrubs too were there, of ev'ry leaf and bloom,</br>Whose tints were beauty, or whose breaths perfume.</br>Each feather'd warbler's song we there could hear,</br>Whose voice had pow'r to charm the tuneful ear;</br>But chief in number, from their little throats</br>The thrush and linnet pour'd melodious notes.</br>Nor had we travers'd long this ample shade,</br>Until we lighted on a secret glade,</br>Where, screen'd from vulgar eyes, a groupe was seen</br>In fourfold dance upon the flow'ry green.</br>There was the ROMAN Bard, whose lyric tongue</br>With frequent praise his clear MAECENAS sung;</br>Who, dazzled oft by Favour's brilliant ray,</br>To base OCTAVIUS rais'd the partial lay,</br>And cast on Flatt'ry's hues his matchless art away.</br>There too was he that charm'd this latter age,</br>The grace and glory of the TUSCAN stage,</br>Whose tender hand the cruel conflict penn'd</br>Of clement TITUS and his guilty friend,</br>And mix'd with tragic colours, dark and strong,</br>The softer, livelier tints of lyric song.</br>Two sister Graces, with their zones unbound,</br>Beat, with this favour'd pair, the verdant ground;</br>The third, a pleas'd spectator, stood beside,</br>With music's pow'r their hounding steps to guide,</br>And make the sportive maze in juster measures glide.", "But when we left this forest of delight,</br>A fair pavilion rose before our sight,</br>On pillars rear'd of PARIAN marble pure,</br>Whose strength and grace thro' ev'ry age endure</br>There with IONIA'S order, rich and gay,</br>Did that of CORINTH hold divided sway;</br>And there was Triumph's tree, the laurel, seen</br>Around each shaft to wreathe its deathless green;</br>While Night's melodious bird, the leaves among,</br>Pour'd the sweet cadence of her matchless song,</br>To whose congenial notes two Poets here,</br>Together seated, lent a raptur'd ear.</br>The MANTUAN Bard, whose pure and perfect lays</br>The voice of ev'ry age has join'd to praise;</br>Whose wond'rous art describ'd, in polish'd strain,</br>The sports and labours of the rural train;</br>And changing themes, from PHRYGIA'S flaming shore</br>LATIUM'S plains the pious exile bore:&mdash;</br>The BRITON too, on whose enchanting tongue</br>The whole exhaustless pow'rs of music hung;</br>Who deck'd in ev'ry colour rich and rare</br>The violation of BELINDA'S hair;</br>Whose splendid course with WINDSOR'S praise began,</br>Who thro' the mighty maze of manners ran,</br>And led his ethic Muse o'er all the field of man.</br>On chairs of gold, enthron'd in equal state,</br>Of Beauty's realm these matchless Monarchs sate,</br>Supreme of all that boast her lovely dow'r,</br>Those sweet companions of the leisure hour;</br>With whom in careless mood we oft retire</br>From the proud masters of the lofty lyre;</br>From those who shake the nerves with comic art,</br>Or with tumultuous passions tear the heart:</br>These are the darling Bards, whose gentle sway</br>The mind without fatigue can still obey;</br>Who soothe th' enchanted ear, and steal the heart away.", ""]
