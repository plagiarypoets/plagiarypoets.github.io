["How beautiful is Ocean!  By its tide,</br>As though my sandals to the beach were grown,</br>I've staid, when first the Indian was descried,</br>Till her firm anchor over deck was thrown;</br>Her name, her mariners to me unknown;</br>Yet, to an ardent gaze, it might appear</br>As though she felt this kingdom were her own;</br>And with augmented energies did steer,</br>Touch'd by the loadstone home, that lay so near.", "Driving impetuous as the mountain bird,</br>That left her offspring in its lofty crest;</br>And when returning near, some sound has heard,</br>Or sign has noticed of her eyrie's nest,</br>The natural impulse glowing in her breast;</br>Through the blue ether faster on she springs,</br>Nor turns aside for prey, nor stoops to rest,</br>Till the hard rock has felt her beating wings,</br>And the young eaglet to her bosom clings.", "Blue skies were then above me, and the deep</br>Seemed hushed and cradled for a summer's rest;</br>Fixed in its beauty, as a babe asleep,</br>Who smiles unchanging in its pearly vest,</br>Or dimples, as the zephyrs fan its breast.</br>These were bright moments (oh, remembered well!)</br>When I came thither an enamour'd guest,</br>And almost listened for the sea-maid's shell,</br>And all the enchanting sounds of which youth's legends tell.</br>"]
