["Dame, said the Panther, times are mended well,</br>Since late among the Philistines you fell,</br>The toils were pitch'd, a spacious tract of ground</br>With expert huntsmen was encompass'd round;</br>Th' Enclosure narrow'd; the sagacious pow'r</br>Of hounds and death, drew nearer ev'ry hour.</br>'Tis true, the younger Lyon 'scaped the snare,</br>But all your priestly calves lay struggling there;</br>As sacrifices on their Altars laid;</br>While you, their carefull mother wisely fled</br>Not trusting destiny to save your head.</br>For, whate'er promises you have apply'd</br>To your unfailing church, the surer side</br>Is four fair leggs in danger to provide.</br>And what e'er tales of Peter's chair you tell,</br>Yet, saving reverence of the miracle,</br>The better luck was yours to 'scape so well.", "As I remember, said the sober Hind,</br>Those toils were for your own dear self design'd,</br>As well as me; and with the self same throw,</br>To catch the quarry, and the vermin too,</br>(Forgive the sland'rous tongues that call'd you so)</br>How e'er you take it now, the common cry</br>Then ran you down for your rank loyalty;</br>Besides, in Popery they thought you nurst,</br>(As evil tongues will ever speak the worst,)</br>Because some forms, and ceremonies some</br>You kept, and stood in the main question dumb.</br>Dumb you were born indeed, but, thinking long</br>The Test it seems at last has loos'd your tongue.</br>And, to explain what your forefathers meant,</br>By real presence in the sacrament,</br>After long fencing pushed against a wall,</br>Your salvo comes, that he's not there at all:</br>There chang'd your faith, and what may change may fall.</br>Who can believe what varies every day,</br>Nor ever was, nor will be at a stay?", "Tortures may force the tongue untruths to tell,</br>And I ne'er owned myself infallible,</br>Reply'd the Panther; grant such Presence were,</br>Yet in your sense I never own'd it there.</br>A real vertue we by faith receive,</br>And that we in the sacrament believe.</br>Then said the Hind, as you the matter state,</br>Not onely Jesuits can equivocate;</br>For real, as you now the word expound,</br>From solid substance dwindles to a sound.</br>Methinks, an Aesop's fable you repeat,</br>You know who took the shadow for the meat:</br>Your churches substance thus you change at will,</br>And yet retain your former figure still.</br>I freely grant you spoke to save your life;</br>For then you lay beneath the butcher's knife.</br>Long time you fought, redoubl'd batt'ry bore,</br>But, after all, against yourself you swore;</br>Your former self; for ev'ry hour your form</br>Is chop'd and chang'd, like winds before a storm.</br>Thus fear and int'rest will prevail with some,</br>For all have not the gift of martyrdome.", "The Panther grin'd at this, and thus reply'd;</br>That men may err was never yet deny'd.</br>But, if that common principle be true,</br>The Canon, Dame, is level'd full at you.</br>But, shunning long disputes, I fain wou'd see</br>That wondrous wight, infallibility.</br>Is he from heav'n this mighty champion come,</br>Or lodg'd below in subterranean Rome?</br>First, seat him somewhere, and derive his race,</br>Or else conclude that nothing has no place.", "Suppose (though I disown it) said the Hind,</br>The certain mansion were not yet assign'd,</br>The doubtfull residence no proof can bring</br>Against the plain existence of the thing.</br>Because Philosophers may disagree,</br>If sight b' emission, or reception be,</br>Shall it be thence inferr'd, I do not see?</br>But you require an answer positive,</br>Which yet, when I demand, you dare not give;</br>For fallacies in Universals live.</br>I then affirm that this unfailing guide</br>In Pope and gen'ral councils must reside;</br>Both lawfull, both combin'd;

for in that I view,</br>When your tradition's forg'd, and when 'tis true.</br>I set 'em by the rule, and, as they square,</br>Or deviate from undoubted doctrine there</br>This Oral fiction, that old Faith declare.", "(Hind.)  The Council steer'd it seems, a diff'rent course,</br>They try'd the Scripture by tradition's force:</br>But you tradition by the Scripture try;</br>Pursued by Sects, from this to that you fly,</br>Nor dare on one foundation to rely.</br>The word is then depos'd, and in this view,</br>You rule the Scripture, not the Scripture you.</br>Thus said the Dame, and, smiling, thus pursu'd,</br>I see tradition then is disallow'd,</br>When not evinc'd by Scripture to be true,</br>And Scripture, as interpreted by you.</br>But here you tread upon unfaithfull ground;</br>Unless you cou'd infallibly expound.</br>Which you reject as odious Popery,</br>And throw that doctrine back with scorn on me.</br>Suppose we on things traditive divide,</br>And both appeal to Scripture to decide;</br>By various texts we both uphold our claim,</br>Nay, often ground our titles on the same:</br>After long labour lost, and times expence,</br>Both grant the words, and quarrel for the sense.</br>Thus all disputes for ever must depend;</br>For no dumb rule can controversies end.</br>Thus, when you said tradition must be try'd</br>By Sacred Writ, whose sense yourselves decide,</br>You said no more, but that your selves must be</br>The judges of the Scripture sense, not we.</br>Against our church tradition you declare,</br>And yet your Clerks wou'd sit in Moyses chair:</br>At least 'tis proved against your argument,</br>The rule is far from plain, where all dissent.", "If not by Scriptures, how can we be sure,</br>(Replied the Panther) what tradition's pure?</br>For you may palm upon us new for old;</br>All, as they say, that glitters, is not gold.", "How but by following her, reply'd the Dame,</br>To whom deriv'd from sire to son they came;</br>Where ev'ry age do's on another move,</br>And trusts no farther than the next above;</br>Where all the rounds like Jacob's ladder rise,</br>The lowest hid in earth, the topmost in the skyes.", "Sternly the salvage did her answer mark,</br>Her glowing eye' balls glitt'ring in the dark,</br>And said but this, since lucre was your trade,</br>Succeeding times such dreadfull gaps have made</br>'Tis dangerous climbing:  to your sons and you</br>I leave the ladder, and its omen too.", "(Hind.)  The Panther's breath was ever fam'd for sweet,</br>But from the Wolfe such wishes oft I meet:</br>You learn'd this language from the blatant beast,</br>Or rather did not speak, but were possess'd.</br>As for your answer 'tis but barely urg'd;</br>You must evince tradition to be forg'd;</br>Produce plain proofs; unblemish'd authors use</br>As antient as those ages they accuse;</br>Till when, 'tis not sufficient to defame:</br>An old possession stands, till Elder quits the claim.</br>Then for our int'rest, which is nam'd alone</br>To load with envy, we retort your own.</br>For when traditions in your faces fly,</br>Resolving not to yield, you must decry:</br>As when the cause goes hard, the guilty man</br>Excepts, and thins his jury all he can;</br>So when you stand of other aid bereft,</br>You to the twelve Apostles wou'd be left.</br>Your friend the Wolfe did with more craft provide</br>To set those toys traditions quite aside:</br>And Fathers too, unless when reason spent,</br>He cites 'em but sometimes for ornament.</br>But, Madam Panther, you, though more sincere,</br>Are not so wise as your Adulterer:</br>The private spirit is a better blind,</br>Than all the dodging tricks your authours find.</br>For they, who left the Scripture to the crowd,</br>Each for his own peculiar judge allow'd;</br>The way to please 'em was to make 'em proud.</br>Thus:  with full sails they ran upon the shelf;</br>Who cou'd suspect a cozenage from himself?</br>On his own reason safer 'tis to stand,</br>Than be deceiv'd and damn'd at second hand.</br>But you who Fathers and traditions take,</br>And garble some, and some you quite forsake,</br>Pretending church auctority to fix,</br>And yet some grains of private spirit mix,</br>Are like a Mule made up of diff'ring seed,</br>And that's the reason why you never breed:</br>At least not propagate your kind abroad,</br>For home-dissenters are by statutes aw'd.</br>And yet they grow upon you ev'ry day,</br>While you (to speak the best) are at a stay,</br>For sects that are extremes abhor a middle way:</br>Like tricks of state, to stop a raging flood,</br>Or mollify a mad-brain'd Senate's mood:</br>Of all expedients never one was good.</br>Well may they argue, (nor can you deny)</br>If we must fix on church authority,</br>Best on the best, the fountain, not the flood;</br>That must be better still, if this be good.</br>Shall she command, who has herself rebell'd?</br>Is antichrist by antichrist expell'd?</br>Did we a lawfull tyranny displace,</br>To set aloft a bastard of the race?</br>Why all these wars to win the Book, if we</br>Must not interpret for ourselves, but she?</br>Either be wholly slaves or wholly free.</br>For purging fires traditions must not fight;</br>But they must prove Episcopacy's right:</br>Thus those led horses are from service freed;</br>You never mount 'em but in time of need.</br>Like mercenary's, hir'd for home defence,</br>They will not serve against their native Prince.</br>Against domestick foes of Hierarchy</br>These are drawn forth, to make fanaticks fly;</br>But, when they see their country-men at hand,</br>Marching against 'em under church-command,</br>Straight they forsake their colours, and disband.", "Thus she, nor cou'd the Panther well enlarge</br>With weak defence against so strong a charge;</br>But said, for what did Christ his Word provide,</br>If still his church must want a living guide?</br>And if all-saving doctrines are not there,</br>Or sacred Pen-men cou'd not make 'em clear,</br>From after ages we should hope in vain</br>For truths which men inspir'd, cou'd not explain.", "Before the Word was written, said the Hind:</br>Our Saviour preach'd his faith to humane kind,</br>From his Apostles the first age receiv'd</br>Eternal truth, and what they taught, believ'd.</br>Thus, by tradition faith was planted first,</br>Succeeding flocks succeeding Pastours nurs'd.</br>This was the way our wise Redeemer chose,</br>(Who sure could all things for the best dispose,)</br>To fence his fold from their encroaching foes.</br>He cou'd have writ himself, but well foresaw</br>Th' event wou'd be like that of Moyses law;</br>Some difference wou'd arise, some doubts remain,</br>Like those which yet the jarring Jews maintain.</br>No written laws can be so plain, so pure,</br>But wit may gloss, and malice may obscure,</br>Not those indited by his first command,</br>A Prophet grav'd the text, an Angel held his hand.</br>Thus faith was e'er the written word appear'd,</br>And men believ'd not what they read, but heard.</br>But since th' Apostles cou'd not be confin'd,</br>To these, or those, but severally design'd</br>Their large commission round the world to blow;</br>To spread their faith, they spread their labours too.</br>Yet still their absent flock their pains did share,</br>They hearken'd still, for love produces care.</br>And as mistakes arose, or discords fell,</br>Or bold seducers taught 'em to rebell,</br>As charity grew cold, or faction hot,</br>Or long neglect their lessons had forgot,</br>For all their wants they wisely did provide,</br>And preaching by Epistles was supply'd:</br>So, great Physicians cannot all attend,</br>But some they visit, and to some they send.</br>Yet all those letters were not writ to all;</br>Nor first intended but occasional.</br>Their absent sermons; nor, if they contain</br>All needfull doctrines, are those doctrines plain.</br>Clearness by frequent preaching must be wrought,</br>They writ but seldome, but they daily taught.</br>And what one Saint has said of holy Paul,</br>He darkly writ, is true apply'd to all.</br>For this obscurity could heav'n provide</br>More prudently than by a living guide,</br>As doubts arose, the difference to decide?</br>A guide was therefore needfull, therefore made,</br>And, if appointed, sure to be obey'd.</br>Thus, with due rev'rence to th' Apostles writ,</br>By which my sons are taught, to which, submit;</br>I think, those truths, their sacred works contain,</br>The church alone can certainly explain,</br>That following ages, leaning on the past,</br>May rest upon the Primitive at last.</br>Nor wou'd I thence the word no rule infer,</br>But none without the church interpreter.</br>Because, as I have urg'd before, 'tis mute,</br>And is itself the subject of dispute.</br>But what th' Apostles their successors taught,</br>They to the next, from them to us is brought,</br>Th' undoubted sense which is in scripture sought.</br>From hence the church is arm'd, when errours rise,</br>To stop their entrance, and prevent surprise;</br>And safe entrench'd within, her foes without defies.</br>By these all festring sores her councils heal,</br>Which time or has disclos'd, or shall reveal,</br>For discord cannot end without a last appeal.</br>Nor can a council national decide,</br>But with subordination to her Guide:</br>(I wish the cause were on that issue try'd.)</br>Much less the scripture; for suppose debate</br>Betwixt pretenders to a fair estate,</br>Bequeath'd by some legatour's last intent;</br>(Such is our dying Saviour's Testament:)</br>The will is prov'd, is open'd, and is read;</br>The doubtfull heirs their diff'ring titles plead:</br>All vouch the words their int'rest to maintain,</br>And each pretends by those his cause is plain.</br>Shall then the testament award the right?</br>No, that's the Hungary for which they fight;</br>The field of battel, subject of debate,</br>The thing contended for, the fair estate.</br>The sense is intricate, 'tis onely clear</br>What vowels and what consonants are there.</br>Therefore 'tis plain, its meaning must be try'd</br>Before some judge appointed to decide.", "Suppose, (the fair apostate said,) I grant,</br>The faithfull flock some living guide should want,</br>Your arguments an endless chase pursue:</br>Produce this vaunted Leader to our view,</br>This mighty Moyses of the chosen crew.", "The Dame, who saw her fainting foe retir'd,</br>With force renew'd, to victory aspir'd;</br>(And looking upward to her kindred sky,</br>As once our Saviour own'd his Deity,</br>Pronounc'd his words &mdash; she whom ye seek am I.)</br>Nor less amaz'd this voice the Panther heard,</br>Than were those Jews to hear a god declar'd.</br>Then thus the matron modestly renew'd,</br>Let all your prophets and their sects be view'd,</br>And see to which of 'em yourselves think fit</br>The conduct of your conscience to submit:</br>Each Proselyte wou'd vote his Doctor best,</br>With absolute exclusion to the rest:</br>Thus wou'd your Polish Diet disagree,</br>And end as it began in Anarchy:</br>Your self the fairest for election stand,</br>Because you seem crown-gen'ral of the land,</br>But soon against your superstitious lawn</br>Some Presbyterian Sabre wou'd be drawn:</br>In your establish'd laws of sov'raignty</br>The rest some fundamental flaw wou'd see,</br>And call Rebellion gospel-liberty.</br>To church-decrees your articles require</br>Submission mollify'd, if not entire;</br>Homage deny'd, to censures you proceed;</br>But when Curtana will not doe the deed,</br>You lay that pointless clergy-weapon by,</br>And to the laws, your sword of justice, fly.</br>Now this your sects the more unkindly take,</br>(Those prying varlets hit the blots you make)</br>Because some ancient friends of yours declare,</br>Your onely rule of faith the Scriptures are,</br>Interpreted by men of judgment sound,</br>Which ev'ry sect will for themselves expound:</br>Nor think less rev'rence to their doctours due</br>For sound interpretation, than to you.</br>If then, by able heads, are understood</br>Your brother prophets, who reformed abroad,</br>Those able heads expound a wiser way,</br>That their own sheep their shepherd shou'd obey.</br>But if you mean your selves are onely sound,</br>That doctrine turns the reformation round,</br>And all the rest are false reformers found.</br>Because in sundry points you stand alone,</br>Not in communion join'd with any one;</br>And therefore must be all the church, or none.</br>Then, till you have agreed whose judge is best,</br>Against this forc'd submission they protest:</br>While sound and sound a diff'rent sense explains</br>Both play at hard-head till they break their brains:</br>And from their chairs each other's force defy,</br>While unregarded thunders vainly fly.</br>I pass the rest, because your church alone</br>Of all usurpers best cou'd fill the throne.</br>But neither you, nor any sect beside</br>For this high office can be qualify'd,</br>With necessary gifts requir'd in such a guide.</br>For that, which must direct the whole, must be</br>Bound in one bond of faith and unity:</br>But all your sev'ral churches disagree.</br>The Consubstantiating church and Priest</br>Refuse communion to the Calvinist;</br>The French reform'd, from preaching you restrain,</br>Because you judge their ordination vain:</br>And so they judge of yours, but Donors must ordain.</br>In short, in doctrine, or in discipline,</br>Not one reform'd can with another join:</br>But all from each, as from damnation, fly;</br>No union, they pretend, but in Non-Popery.</br>Nor, shou'd their members in a synod meet;</br>Cou'd any church presume to mount the seat</br>Above the rest, their discords to decide;</br>None wou'd obey, but each wou'd be the guide:</br>And face to face dissentions wou'd encrease;</br>For onely distance now preserves the peace.</br>All in their turns accusers, and accus'd;</br>Babel was never half so much confus'd.</br>What one can plead, the rest can plead as well;</br>For amongst equals lies no last appeal,</br>And all confess themselves are fallible.</br>Now, since you grant some necessary guide,</br>All who can err are justly laid aside:</br>Because a trust so sacred to confer</br>Shows want of such a sure interpreter:</br>And how can he be needfull who can err?</br>Then, granting that unerring guide we want,</br>That such there is you stand obliged to grant:</br>Our Saviour else were wanting to supply</br>Our needs, and obviate that necessity.</br>It then remains, that church can onely be</br>The guide, which owns unfailing certainty;</br>Or else you slip your hold, and change your side,</br>Relapsing from a necessary guide.</br>But this annex'd condition of the crown,</br>Immunity from errours, you disown;</br>Here then you shrink, and lay your weak pretensions down.</br>For petty royalties you raise debate;</br>But this unfailing universal state</br>You shun; nor dare succeed to such a glorious weight.</br>And for that cause those promises detest</br>With which our Saviour did his Church invest:</br>But strive t' evade, and fear to find 'em true,</br>As conscious they were never meant to you:</br>All which the mother church asserts her own,</br>And with unrivall'd claim ascends the throne.</br>So when of old th' Almighty father sate</br>In Council, to redeem our ruin'd state,</br>Millions of millions at a distance round,</br>Silent the sacred Consistory crown'd,</br>To hear what mercy mixt with justice cou'd propound.</br>All prompt, with eager pity, to fulfill</br>The full extent of their Creatour's will:</br>But when the stern conditions were declar'd,</br>A mournfull whisper through the host was heard,</br>And the whole hierarchy, with heads hung down,</br>Submissively declin'd the ponderous proffer'd crown.</br>Then, not till then, th' eternal Son from high</br>Rose in the strength of all the Deity;</br>Stood forth t' accept the terms, and underwent</br>A weight which all the frame of heav'n had bent,</br>Nor he Himself cou'd bear, but as omnipotent.</br>Now, to remove the least remaining doubt,</br>That ev'n the blear-ey'd sects may find her out,</br>Behold what heav'nly rays adorn her brows,</br>What from his Wardrobe her belov'd allows,</br>To deck the wedding-day of his unspotted spouse.</br>Behold what marks of majesty she brings;</br>Richer than ancient heirs of Eastern kings:</br>Her right hand holds the sceptre and the keys,</br>To show whom she commands, and who obeys;</br>With these to bind, or set the sinner free</br>With that t' assert spiritual Royalty.", "One in herself not rent by schism, but sound,</br>Entire, one solid shining Diamond,</br>Not sparkles shatter'd into sects like you,</br>One is the church, and must be to be true:</br>One central principle of unity.</br>As undivided, so from errours free,</br>As one in faith, so one in sanctity.</br>Thus she, and none but she, th' insulting rage</br>Of Hereticks oppos'd from age to age:</br>Still when the Gyant-brood invades her throne</br>She stoops from heav'n, and meets 'em halfway down,</br>And with paternal thunder vindicates her crown.</br>But like Aegyptian Sorcerers you stand,</br>And vainly lift aloft your magick wand,</br>To sweep away the swarms of vermin from the land:</br>You cou'd, like them, with like infernal force</br>Produce the plague, but not arrest the course.</br>But when the boils and botches, with disgrace</br>And publick scandal sat upon the face,</br>Themselves attack'd, the Magi strove no more,</br>They saw God's finger, and their fate deplore;</br>Themselves they cou'd not cure of the dishonest sore.", "Thus one, thus pure, behold her largely spread,</br>Like the fair ocean from her mother bed;</br>From East to West triumphantly she rides,</br>All shoars are water'd by her wealthy

traffick more than we,</br>For they on gain, their onely God, rely:</br>And set a publick price on piety.</br>Industrious of the needle and the chart</br>They run full sail to their Japonian
