I'd a song indite,</br>To chant thy praises; but &mdash; I cannot write.", "NANCY.</br>With thee, dear TOM!  I'll range the flow'ry mead;</br>But write no songs &mdash; for, ah!  I cannot read.", "TOM.</br>Well, then, we'll love, from day-light till 'tis dark,</br>And leave such learning to our Parish-clerk.", "NANCY.</br>Or e'en the Parson's maid might do as well;</br>For she's a scholard, and can write and spell.", "TOM.</br>And thou can'st knit and spin, and that is better;</br>And I can work, tho' I don't know one letter.", "NANCY.</br>O!  that we'd learn'd to read when we were young,</br>And say our catikeys &mdash; and vulgar tongue!", "TOM.</br>Well; now each child may learn in SUNDAY SCHOOLS,</br>And little John will make us look like fools.", "NANCY.</br>God bless Squire RAIKES, who first those Schools did found;</br>To which our Gentry now give many a pound.</br>Now, neat and clean, poor boys and girls we meet&mdash;</br>Not running wild and ragged, through the street.", "TOM.</br>Now, boys and girls are taught to read and sing,</br>And say their pray'rs, and pray for Church and King.</br>Then let us go to Church on Sunday night,</br>And hear them sing Sol-fa' with all their might.", "NANCY.</br>We will, and though I cannot sing the best,</br>My voice, so shrill, shall squeak amongst the rest.", "TOM.</br>But, lo!  our sheep quite out of sight are got,</br>And now the noon-tide Sun grows plaguy hot.", "NANCY.</br>Then you drive up your sheep, and I'll go home,</br>And boil the pot, and spin till you are come.</br>EXEUNT.</br>"]
