["How happy a Shepherd am I,</br>With LAURA, the pride of my heart;</br>I'll never once languish or sigh,</br>For know, she has caus'd all my smart.</br>She vows that she will be my wife</br>By all that is honest and fair,</br>Then I'll be her husband for life,</br>And never know sorrow or care.", "Brother shepherds that toil on the plain,</br>By me take example, I pray,</br>Throw off all your sorrow and pain,</br>And ever be chearful and gay.</br>Then nymphs that are modest and shy,</br>For once hear young DAMON'S advice;</br>The reason I tell you, for why,</br>As happy you'll be in a trice.", "Give each of your hands to your swain,</br>Then drive away faction and strife;</br>Bid adieu to all anguish and pain!</br>And be happy th' rest of your life.</br>Such is DAMON'S advice, my kind fair;</br>Then take it most freely, I pray;</br>So fly from all sorrow and care,</br>Henceforward be merry and gay.</br>"]
