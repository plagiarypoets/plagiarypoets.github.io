["Forlorn is he who trusts to-morrow's fate:</br>The genial sun will rise, but not for him.</br>The fool who revels high in gorgeous state</br>Ne'er sees the frightful face of Mis'ry grim,</br>Or views of bitter woe before him swim.</br>The poet's cottage is her surest seat;</br>O'er his meek head she flaps her raven wing;</br>Poisons the pittance poor that he must eat;</br>With deadly juice taints the Pierian spring,</br>And bids her spirits lurk beneath each warbling string.", "Fair promise oft may come with smiling face;</br>But trust not, trust not her deceiving wile!</br>Envy perhaps may mar each well-masqued grace,</br>And foul Disdain usurp the pitying smile.</br>O mortal wight!  what is thy life but toil;</br>A pilgrimage of woes, a false embrace;</br>A lasting pain where Disappointment rears</br>Her scorpion whip to sting thy gentlest peace;</br>To Innocence shuts close her iron ears,</br>And from the aching heart each beauteous phantom tears?", "Alert we climb the mountain's rugged brow;</br>And toil to gain the summit, idly vain:</br>At last we find that bliss was left below,</br>And proud Ambition is the sire of Pain.</br>Bright-tressed Transport, and her jocund train,</br>In the deep valley bid their blossom blow:</br>Struggling Desire the lofty cliff would climb,</br>But foul Derision stands his grinning foe:</br>Awhile he stands; but, lo!  in flow'ry prime</br>Mischance will hurl him swift from potency sublime.", "Forlorn is he who trusts to-morrow's dawn.</br>Then let no glitt'ring gauds delude thine eye;</br>Let Hope's fond rainbow scenery be withdrawn,</br>And brighter aims recal thy glance on high.</br>Fulfilment is the daughter of the sky,</br>Who bids frail doubts and subtleties be gone;</br>With Destiny she shares her radiant seat,</br>Placed to the right of the eternal throne:</br>She can alone make saddest sorrows sweet,</br>Erase thy sable stains, and make thee all-complete.</br>"]
