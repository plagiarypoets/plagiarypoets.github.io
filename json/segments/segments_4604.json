["O!  what shall my feelings declare?</br>O!  how shall I number my woes?</br>Since I caught such a glance of the fair,</br>As has banish'd all hope of repose.</br>At beauty how oft have I gaz'd,</br>Of beauty, how oft have I sung:</br>For beauty was form'd to be prais'd,</br>And her smiles to unfetter my tongue!", "Hither throng, all ye tender desires!</br>Ye Muses!  ye Loves!  hither throng;</br>HONORIA awakens my fires,</br>'Tis HONORIA who merits the song.</br>But all my endeavours are vain;</br>'Twere madness her praises to scale;</br>A poet!  and not breathe a strain&mdash;</br>A lover!  and courage to fail!&mdash;", "But what would avail all his art,</br>When the poet considers the theme?</br>The lover with firmness might part,</br>Whose happiness seems but a dream!</br>From a task, that would pose bigot-zeal,</br>'Tis sure no discredit to fly;</br>At her feet too, where monarchs might kneel,</br>Methinks, 'twere a pleasure to die!", "'Tis late, that I came to the plain,</br>But late, I consulted my ease;</br>My youth was an era of pain,</br>And my quiet &mdash; the sport of the seas!</br>But still, on what shore I was thrown,</br>The rigors whate'er of the clime;</br>My liberty sweet, was my own,</br>And I dreaded no victor, but time!", "Alas!  that a nymph of the grove,</br>More fatal than tempests should be;</br>Alas!  that the arrows of Love,</br>Should only be poison'd for me!</br>Whene'er on my rivals I muse,</br>To what depths of despair am I hurl'd&mdash;</br>For how but to doubt, can he choose,</br>Whose rivals consist &mdash; of a world!", "Then, since neither titles nor birth,</br>Nor talents, her hand can ensure;</br>Since Kingdoms fall short of her worth,</br>For the purchase &mdash; a CROESUS were poor!</br>Cease, cease, thy demerits to heed,</br>Essay her compassion to move;</br>Tho' a shepherd &mdash; thy truth may succeed,</br>For the price of HONORIA, is love!</br>"]
