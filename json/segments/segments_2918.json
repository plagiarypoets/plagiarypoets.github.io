["Here lie in peace, life's changeful voyage o'er,</br>The tired wanderers of the faithless main;</br>They find a shelter on that peaceful shore,</br>Where rest the weary from their toil and pain.", "With courage fired, at honour's great command,</br>They left the bowers of indolence and ease,</br>Forsook the pleasures of their native land,</br>And ploughed with dauntless heart the foaming seas.", "Britannia's thunder, dreadful to the foe,</br>Unwearied o'er the pathless deep they bore,</br>Full oft they aim'd the well-directed blow,</br>Full oft they bade the murdering cannon roar.", "Amid the scenes of danger and of death,</br>Where hostile squadrons met in dread array,</br>Dauntless they stood, prepar'd to yield their breath,</br>Or follow still, where danger led the way.", "The fierce extremes every clime they bore,</br>The burning rage of equinoctial skies,</br>Or where the polar billows ceaseless roar,</br>Where horrid mountains piled of ice arise.", "When rising tempests vex'd the briny tide,</br>And shook old ocean with tremendous sound,</br>Well were they skill'd the shatter'd bark to guide,</br>Where hidden dangers compass'd them around.", "Far from the comforts of their native soil,</br>Amid the scenes of elemental strife,</br>Still pain and penury and ceaseless toil</br>Mark'd the unvaried tenor of their life.", "But now the fury of the savage blast</br>No more shall rouse them from their bed of clay;</br>Their weary wanderings and their toils are past,</br>And all the storms of life are blown away.</br>"]
