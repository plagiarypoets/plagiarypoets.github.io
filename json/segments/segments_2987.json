["Waft me, oh  waft me to the shade,</br>By close embow'ring branches made!</br>Where purling brooks and trinkling rills</br>In soft harmonious cadence play,</br>And sweetly murmur all the day!", "Oh!  let me there for ever dwell,</br>In the green grot or mossy cell!</br>And, free from hurry, care, and strife,</br>Enjoy a lonely, peaceful life;</br>There hermit-like, with pious care,</br>Find out my God, for God is there!", "In thoughtful mood there let me learn</br>The vanity of life to mourn;</br>Lament the dire effects of fate,</br>And dreadful downfalls of the great;</br>See pyramids and turrets high,</br>In piles of mighty ruin lie;</br>And mark how tombs of trophy'd kinds</br>Time into dark oblivion flings.</br>Oh!  happy solitude!  in thee,</br>At length, my greatest good I see;</br>Nor would I leave thy homely cell,</br>For domes where scepter'd monarchs dwell,</br>Thou spotless pleasures can'st supply,</br>With thee I'll live, with thee I'll die.</br>"]
