["When weary of the world's perplexing change,</br>How sweet it is the troubled gaze to rest</br>On the wild silence of yon mountain range,</br>Where yet the eagle builds his lonely nest;</br>Or wistfully to watch the lake's unruffl'd breast!", "Oh!  sweet it is, amid the calm sublime,</br>To lose each little, sordid, earth-born care,</br>To lift our souls above the wrongs of time;</br>For here, where all is solemn, grand, and fair,</br>One thought to human strife 'twere sacrilege to spare!", "Is there a nobler, loftier, lovelier scene,</br>Repose more meet for Contemplation's eye,</br>Than the broad bosom of yon lake serene,</br>Reflecting back the golden, glorious sky,</br>Or some cloud-crown'd cliff's aspiring majesty?", "Yes, silent Nature, lovely as thou art,</br>There is a charm, and I have felt its pow'r,</br>Which sweeter peace sheds o'er the troubled heart,</br>Than e'en the sunshine of thy evening hour,</br>When balm is on the breeze, and dew is on the flow'r.", "There is a sunbeam more sublimely bright</br>Than ever darted from the orb of day,&mdash;</br>When, from the heart the pure internal light</br>Of virtue's sun sends forth its heavenly ray</br>O'er some benignant brow in smiles divine to play!", "Oh *******!  well thy spirit may delight</br>Such haunts to trace of beauty and of rest,</br>And o'er them fling a portion of the light</br>Which warms and animates thine own bright breast,</br>Tinting each placid scene with hues more blest</br>Than ever evening sun spreads o'er the ruddy west!</br>"]
