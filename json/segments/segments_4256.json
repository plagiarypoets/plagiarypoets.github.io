["My moments, ye Gods, were once blest,</br>When Jessy bloom'd fair as the day;</br>But, ah!  Death has broken my rest,</br>And tore my dear Jessy away.</br>No more shall I dwell with delight</br>On the sweet melting voice of my fair;</br>For Jessy is lost to my sight,</br>And Colin is plunged in despair.", "My Jessy, thy form was divine,</br>Thy mind sweetly beam'd in thy face;</br>The Virtues lov'd there to combine,</br>And gather fresh lustre and grace.</br>Thy shepherd was still thy delight,</br>Was ever so happy a pair!</br>But now thou art lost to my sight,</br>And Colin knows nought but despair.", "When Night wraps the fields in her gloom,</br>I haste to where Jessy is laid,</br>There pour out my soul at her tomb,</br>Cursing Death for the rapine he made.</br>Sad Philomel hears me complain,</br>And awhile does her sorrow forego;</br>But soon she resumes it again,</br>And fills up each pause of my woe.", "Heav'n has not the pow'r to restore</br>The bliss that I once did obtain;</br>And it still makes me sorrow the more,</br>Because all my sorrow is vain.</br>Fierce Death now thy pow'r I defy,</br>Thou hast robb'd me of all I held dear;</br>Since Jessy is lost to my eye,</br>Life now is beneath Colin's care.</br>"]
