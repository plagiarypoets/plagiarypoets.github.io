["How sink the brave, who in the blaze expire,</br>Where tyrants kindled freedom's funeral pyre;</br>Who in her dear defence their falchions bore,</br>And sought to conquer, fell to bleed no more.", "Oft memory lingers near, their turf to bless,</br>And scatter o'er it nature's brightest dress;</br>Oft valor pauses, as he passes by,</br>And many a tribute sparkles in his eye.", "Oft freedom leaves her wildly blooming cell,</br>And haunts the turf, where crumbling heroes dwell,</br>Bends o'er the sainted earth, and bathes the sod,</br>Of those, who rose from battle to their God.</br>"]
