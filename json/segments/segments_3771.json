["No more of times, when from yon magic chair,</br>Planted on rocks stupendous &mdash; I descended,</br>Oblivious to mortal sight &mdash; so thick a film</br>Has clouded human vision, and deprav'd</br>Sin &mdash; caus'd:  yet not the less urge I the task</br>Assign'd me, and all the inferior spirits curb</br>To work our high benevolence on man:</br>On him, who, o'er the foaming surf light borne,</br>Unconscious as the Bark he guides, passes</br>Regardless of those legions ministrant,</br>Who in the cool stream lave their shining limbs,</br>And on the ebbing wave, as on a couch,</br>Pendant repose delighted.  Nor unapt,</br>Nor unimportant to material mold</br>This spiritual knowledge, since from thence</br>Startled humanity, who plunges deep</br>Into the dashing surge, after some wreck,</br>And on his shoulders, to the hapless shore</br>Bears life suspended &mdash; may be taught to think</br>Thousands of aiding forms around him glide,</br>Supply his wasting spirits, and the nerves</br>Slacken'd, rebrace with energy unknown.</br>And full of need, my unrelenting guard,</br>Sublimely plac'd, where I may view afar</br>Aught perilous to his who rules this soil,</br>CORINCUS &mdash; He, coming with Trojan BRUTE,</br>Who fled by sea for SYLVIUS, his sire,</br>With undesigned aim pierced by his shaft,</br>Took, as by lot, the wide extended plain</br>Below this mount; his chief delight to chase</br>And tame within their dens a giant Brood,</br>Fiercer than those titancan, whom they fable</br>Strove once with JOVE:  These buried deep in caves</br>From day, that shames their toils, by magic spells</br>Create an artificial light metallic, which</br>Their earthly spirits at such grand behests</br>Win from the tortur'd earth, and, purg'd by flame,</br>In liquid sheets resplendent mirrors cast</br>Of mineral malleable, such as bears</br>Superior polish, and reflects around</br>The glowing treasures of their vast domain.</br>Yet not the fear of this bold Trojan's arm,</br>Nor of the powers divine, compels them there</br>To find perpetual empire; oft emerging</br>When sullen darkness in his gathering spleen</br>Blots out the lights of Heav'n, and hideous Tempest,</br>His near ally, howls on the waste of waves;</br>Then o'er the changing cliffs they speed their way,</br>And bathe in human blood their horrid fangs,</br>The life of wretches, by the boiling wave</br>Dash'd on the shore.</br>"]
