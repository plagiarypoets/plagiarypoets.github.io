["Come, Meditation, Heaven-born Power!</br>Seek with me the shady bower,</br>Where classic Science spreads her eagle wing;</br>Or at mellow Music's shrine,</br>Sweep with the tuneful Nine,</br>Upborne on Fancy's car, the warbling lyre;</br>While the fair Dryads join the festive choir,</br>And on the light toe, form the sportive ring.</br>But where conceal'd art Thou?</br>On Appenina's head of snow,</br>'Mid storms of elemental war,</br>The mountain-torrent murmuring from afar?</br>Or in some sylvan glade,</br>Where the Genius of the shade,</br>Warbles deep the Doric reed,</br>By some mossy fountain's side,</br>As the lonely moorhen sits,</br>Screaming o'er the sedgy tide;</br>Or rid'st on the still clouds of starless night,</br>That roll in sullen gloom, impervious to the sight?", "Methinks beneath yon pile I see Thee lie,</br>Yon Gothic Abbey woos Thy wandering feet;</br>O'er whose torn height, the screech owl's ivied seat,</br>The moon resplendent rides athwart the sky.</br>The sheeted dead, in Fancy's eye,</br>Stalk along the gloomy aisle;</br>And melancholy heaves the sigh,</br>Bending o'er the sainted pile.</br>Low at the rifted column's base,</br>Ravenous Ruin holds his place;</br>And giant Desolation from his bower,</br>Shakes the dismantled wall, and storms the tottering tower.", "But leave the dim, monastic cells,</br>Where baleful superstition dwells;</br>And seek Thy dripping cave,</br>Beside the curling wave.</br>Here, undisturbed, but by the murmuring gale,</br>That slowly wafts along the evening tide,</br>Thou sittest, thoughtful Maid, and by thy side,</br>Virtue and Truth thy vesper sighs inhale.</br>Here too, sweet Poesy, her mild head rears,</br>And scatters from her brow Parnassian bays;</br>Her upraised arm grasps the Eolian lyre,</br>While soft she breathes her tuneful lays</br>In Thy attentive ear,</br>O Thou, the Maid, whose Heaven-directing Power,</br>With gifted Truth inspired the Athenian Sage!</br>He, nursed by Thee in Virtue's sacred bower,</br>Illumed the darkness of an erring age,</br>And piercing doubt with eagle eye,</br>Revealed the visions of Futurity.</br>O Meditation!  let me dwell</br>For ever in Thy halcyon cell,</br>Where by Thy heavenly Spirit led,</br>To hold high converse with the dead,</br>The hallowed tracks I may explore,</br>Which he, Thy loved Athenian, trod before.</br>"]
