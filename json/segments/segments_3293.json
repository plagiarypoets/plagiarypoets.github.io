["O, share my Cottage, dearest Maid!&mdash;</br>Beneath a Mountain, wild and high,</br>It nestles, in a silent glade;</br>And Wye's clear current wander by.</br>Each tender Care, each honest Art</br>Shall chase all future want from thee,</br>When thy sweet lips consent impart</br>To climb these steepy hills with me.", "Far from the City's vain parade,</br>No scornful brow shall there be seen;</br>No dull impertinence invade,</br>Nor Envy base, nor sullen Spleen.</br>The shadowy Rocks which circle round</br>From Storms shall guard our sylvan Cell;</br>And there shall ev'ry joy be found</br>That loves in peaceful vales to dwell.", "When late the tardy Sun shall peer,</br>And faintly gild yon little spire;</br>When nights are long, and frosts severe,</br>And our clean hearth is bright with fire,</br>Sweet tales to read &mdash; sweet songs to sing!&mdash;</br>O, they shall drown the wind and rain</br>E'en till the softened season bring</br>Merry Spring-time back again!", "Then Hawthorns, flow'ring in the glen,</br>Shall guard the warbling Plumy Throng;</br>Nor boast the busy haunts of Men</br>So fair a scene, so sweet a song.</br>Thy arms the new-yean'd Lamb will shield,</br>And to the sunny shelter bear;</br>While, o'er the rough and breathing field,</br>My hands impel the gleaming share.", "Ne'er doubt our Wheaten ears will rise,</br>And full their yellow harvest glow;</br>Then prove, with me, the sprightly joys</br>That Love and Industry bestow.</br>Their jocund power can banish strife,</br>Her clouds no passing day will see,</br>Since all the leisure hours of life</br>Shall still be spent in pleasing thee.</br>"]
