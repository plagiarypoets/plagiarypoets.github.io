["Kind Nature with a mother's joys</br>Her every art to charm employs,</br>For man the golden king of day</br>Pours light, health, beauty, in his ray.</br>The morn in silver tresses bright,</br>With milder charms salutes his sight,</br>And night, her shadowy curtain draws,</br>Indulging sleeps refreshing pause:</br>For man the purply finger'd hours,</br>Dress beauteous spring in new blown flow'rs,</br>Teach her to breathe a rich perfume,</br>And smile with eye-enchanting bloom.</br>Then ripe in beauty's glowing pride,</br>Blithe summer, Sol's refulgent bride,</br>Bids plenty revel o'er the plains,</br>And carol heart-enlivening strains.</br>Next autumn calls the sylvan pow'rs,</br>To lay him soft in shady bow'rs,</br>Where grape and nectarine, plumb and peach,</br>May tempting hang within his reach.</br>Last, winter comes to rule the year,</br>In sweet vicissitude severe.</br>See him on Zembla's mountains stand,</br>He stretches out his palsied hand,</br>And all his magazines unfold</br>Their copious hoards of ice and cold:</br>The hail, in vollies rattles round,</br>The snow descending, shrouds the ground:</br>Deep bellowing bursts of thunders roll,</br>And pleasing horror swells the soul.</br>With still improv'd delight, the mind</br>Beholds her powers unconfin'd,</br>She roves with nature, and explains</br>What virtues live in secret veins</br>Of herbs; bids Flora's children rise</br>In naked beauty to her eyes,</br>To the soft serenade of gales</br>Thro' oceans liquid realms she sails,</br>Thro' pearly worlds, thro' coral groves,</br>Where every scaly wonder roves:</br>With Phoebus, in his chariot driv'n,</br>She journey's thro' the expanse of heav'n:</br>Now rolling round on Saturn's ring,</br>Now roving on the comet's wing,</br>And urging still her airy flight,</br>She gains those smiling realms of light,</br>Where sons of bliss, immortals dwell,</br>In golden groves of Asphodel.</br>Now conscious of celestial skill,</br>Her forming pow'r she tries at will,</br>Her pencil weds assenting dies,</br>And see a new born world arise.</br>Here charms the eye the blossom'd grove,</br>Where, looking bliss, young lovers rove;</br>There serpentine the river glides,</br>And nibbling flocks adorn its sides.</br>Soft'ning to flesh the marble lives,</br>And takes each attitude she gives:</br>Here nerv'd to strength the hero stands,</br>There orators extend their hands,</br>The patriot here, by Freedom's side,</br>Smiling pours out the vital tide;</br>Here beauty charms the gazing eye,</br>The loves and graces waiting by:</br>Is it the breeze that wakes the spring,</br>Or say, does Philomela sing,</br>And bid the list'ning ear rejoice?</br>'Tis music tunes her heav'nly voice,</br>Her voice of sweetest skill to raise</br>The drooping heart ten thousand ways.</br>Now heav'n-caught fury fires the soul,</br>And spurning oft earth's dull controul,</br>Vent'rous she wings her full-plum'd flight,</br>Detects new regions of delight:</br>Led by enchantress fancy roves,</br>The muses gay ideal groves,</br>Where countless beings strike her eye,</br>Confus'd in glitt'ring novelty:</br>But what the varied years delight,</br>Or what the mental ken so bright,</br>Or what the kind inspiring muses,</br>To bliss that genuine love transfuses!</br>The parent fond impassion'd flew,</br>The filial duteous grateful glow,</br>Congenial friendship, heav'nly true,</br>And pity pressing balmy dew</br>The feast of converse, that dispenses</br>Rapture to fill up all the senses,</br>Where reason, mirth, good-humour sit,</br>And beauty sparkles into wit.</br>Here too, as in the natural scene,</br>Triumphs the mind, creative queen,</br>Here fancy, with illusion kind,</br>Indulges ev'ry longing mind,</br>Brings to the lover, in despair</br>His mutually impassion'd fair,</br>Adorns the frightful female face</br>With beauties cull'd from ev'ry grace;</br>Instructs ambition's slave to nod,</br>Applauds the bards prosaic songs,</br>Gives eloquence to stamm'ring tongues,</br>Lets oceans sons their haven gain,</br>Unbinds the captive's galling chain;</br>To poverty each joy bestows,</br>From rich humanity that flows,</br>Gives her at once herself to bless,</br>And charm the virtues in distress,</br>Yet still reserves the sapient mind,</br>Her darling free born joy behind,</br>When with fond eyes she loves to trace</br>The beauties of her mortal race,</br>And with blithe confidence can say</br>She liv'd with virtue ev'ry day,</br>That still she urg'd life's great design,</br>To fit herself for bliss divine;</br>Then conscience lends the plausive note</br>Thro' ev'ry sense of joy to float,</br>Strikes music from each vital string,</br>That envies not when angels sing</br>Dissolv'd in ecstacy she lies,</br>And sweetly pre-enjoys the skies.</br>"]
