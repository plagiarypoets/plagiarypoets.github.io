["Tread soft, ye mortals, o'er this hallow'd ground!</br>Full many gentle villagers here rest</br>Who till'd in days of yore the fields around,</br>With calm contentment, humble virtue blest.", "Go, seek the flow'ry paths of peace they trod,</br>From guilt, ambition, and from sorrow free;</br>Like them, thy neighbour love, adore thy God,</br>And for thy race provide with industry.", "So mayest thou, when Fate shall seal thy doom,</br>And thou beneath the grass-green sod shall lie,</br>Like them enjoy the sabbath of the tomb,</br>Like them ascend to endless bliss on high!</br>"]
