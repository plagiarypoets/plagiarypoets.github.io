["As down by the wood-land I stray'd,</br>Where daisies enamell'd the way,</br>Where Flora her frolics had play'd,</br>Unveiling her charms to the day;</br>The warblers awaken'd the song,</br>The dew-drops hung down on the thorn,</br>The Zephyrs went gently along,</br>And Phoebus embellish'd the morn.", "In rapture I went through the grove,</br>Delighted with richest perfume,</br>Saw nature devoted to love,</br>And the birds their fond labours resume;</br>The lark had its ditty re-told,</br>The blackbird was heard from the vine,</br>The herdsman was driving from fold,</br>And sung, \"'Tis a shame to repine.\"", "With gratitude musing I view'd</br>The landskip, so splendidly dress'd;</br>Gay Fancy her magic renew'd,</br>Imprinting her scenes on my breast:</br>When lo!  from an opening I saw</br>A damsel come tripping the glade;</br>I trembled with transport and awe,</br>Afraid to offend the sweet maid.", "No language her charms could unfold,</br>No pencil her beauties display,</br>Her hair hung like ringlets of gold,</br>Her eye was the di'mond's bright ray;</br>Her bosom the lily out-vy'd,</br>Her lips which I panted to view,</br>In the blush of the rose-bud were dy'd,</br>And her fingers all glitter'd with dew.", "Her head with a chaplet was dress'd,</br>Of May-flow'rs and cowslips combin'd,</br>A garland hung over her breast,</br>With blue-bells and vi'lets entwin'd;</br>Her garment, in negligent flow,</br>Her graces all artless display'd&mdash;</br>'Twas dipp'd in the tint of the bow</br>That Iris in April had made.", "New flowrets her footsteps bestrew'd,</br>For all was enchantment around,</br>The cuckow her ballad renew'd,</br>And mix'd with the music her sound&mdash;</br>Forgive me, ye pow'rs!  If I bow'd</br>To worship a form so divine,</br>A mortal might sure be allow'd</br>To bend at a goddess's shrine.", "I gaz'd as each look were my last;</br>With rapture I think on her now&mdash;</br>And said as she carelessly pass'd,</br>\"Thy name to thy vot'ry avow&mdash;</br>Say, nymph, so delightful and gay,</br>Art thou from the mansions above?\"</br>She smil'd and she answer'd &mdash; \"NEW MAY,</br>And mine are the mansions of Love.\"</br>"]
