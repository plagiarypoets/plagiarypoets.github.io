["No common mind illum'd thy cold remains;</br>Freedom almost its God!  Wherever men</br>Had hearts that throbb'd against oppression's chains,</br>Thine beat with sympathy; thy voice and pen</br>Would cheer them to the glorious strife, and when</br>A tyrant triumph'd, or a people fell,</br>Thy buoyant spirit and pure soul would stem</br>The tide of fate, with Hope portray'd so well,</br>That she would linger still where Freedom dar'd not dwell!", "Too early for thy country and thy name,</br>Too early for the hearts you leave behind,</br>Was thy hard doom.  You lov'd them all, and Fame</br>Held a proud empire o'er thy glowing mind&mdash;</br>Now all but that is scatter'd to the wind:</br>It was immortal, and gave bright presage,</br>If death had spar'd thee till thy sun declin'd;</br>Perchance thy name had liv'd from age to age,</br>Trac'd by the hand of Glory on Time's ample page!", "Or hadst thou fall'n as Fancy now beholds,</br>The green flag floating o'er thy bleeding breast,</br>Thy glaring eye fix'd on its waving folds,</br>And shouts of triumph hyming thee to rest&mdash;</br>With Friendship's victor hand in thy close prest!</br>This lyre's proud notes to heaven thy praise had thrown,</br>Rejoicing; that you gave at Fame's behest,</br>The bauble breath &mdash; for breath, which she alone</br>Strikes from the patriot's harp in many a cherish'd tone.", "But that's a dream &mdash; thy growing hopes, thy years,</br>Are clos'd forever in the silent grave&mdash;</br>It has been honour'd &mdash; and will be, by tears</br>Far dearer to thy soul than all we gave</br>In worldly sorrow, for the young, the brave.</br>But oh!  the suffocating sobs that rise</br>When death has burst the links &mdash; love could not save.</br>Such hallow'd grief is his from mortal eyes!</br>Heal'd be the mourner's hearts, and hush'd my own vain sighs.</br>"]
