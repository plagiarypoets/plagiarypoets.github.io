["Glory and boast of Avalon's fair vale,</br>How beautiful thy ancient turrets rose!</br>Fancy yet seems them, in the sunshine pale</br>Gleaming, or more majestic in repose,&mdash;</br>When west-away, the crimson landscape glows,&mdash;</br>Casting their shadows on the waters wide,</br>How sweet the sounds, that, at still day-light's close</br>Came blended with the airs of eventide,</br>When thro' the glimmering aisle faint \"misereres\" died!", "But all is silent now! &mdash; silent the bells,</br>That, heard from yonder ivy turret high,</br>Warn'd the cowl'd brother from his midnight cell;&mdash;</br>Silent the vesper-chaunt &mdash; the Litany</br>Responsive to the organ! &mdash; scatter'd lie</br>The wrecks of the proud Pile 'mid arches grey,&mdash;</br>Whilst hollow winds through mantling ivy sigh,</br>And e'en the mould'ring shrine is rent away,</br>Where, in his warrior weeds, the British Arthur lay.", "Now look upon the sister Fane of Wells!</br>It lifts its forehead in the lucid air,&mdash;</br>Sweet o'er the champaign sound its Sabbath bells,&mdash;</br>Its roof rolls back the chaunt, or voice of prayer,</br>Anxious we ask, \"Will heav'n that temple spare?</br>Or mortal tempest sweep it from its state?</br>Oh!  say, shall Time revere that fabric fair,</br>Or shall it meet, in distant years, thy fate,</br>Shatter'd, Proud Pile, like thee, and left as desolate?", "NO!  to subdue or elevate the soul,</br>Our best, our purest, feelings to refine,</br>Still, shall the solemn Diapasons roll</br>Through the high Fane!  still hues reflected shine,</br>From the tall windows, on the sculptur'd shrine,</br>Tinging the pavement!  for He shall afford&mdash;</br>He who directs the storm &mdash; his aid divine,</br>Because its Sion has not left thy word,</br>Nor sought for other guide than Thee, Almighty Lord!</br>"]
