["Hush'd is the fury of the wint'ry storm</br>Melodious murmurs warble through the wood;</br>The plain no longer shakes</br>Beneath the torrent's roar.", "O THOU, whose bounty bids the meadows smile</br>With verdant bounty and with fragrant flowers,</br>Who deignest to adorn</br>All Nature with thy love!", "THOU, whose high mandate sun and stars obey,</br>Sow in our bosoms those prolific seeds</br>Whence springs the heavenly flowers</br>Of gratitude divine.", "From the full fountain of thy GRACE bedew</br>Our spirits; so the blossoms of thy love</br>Shall flourish in our hearts</br>In never-fading bloom.", "And while the murmuring bee from flower to flower,</br>Assiduous, o'er the breathing garden flies,</br>Or sits on balmy thyme,</br>Extracting vernal sweets;", "Still more assiduous in melliflous strains</br>This prostrate heart thy goodness would rehearse,</br>And with th' adoring world</br>Would glorify thy NAME!</br>"]
