["Ye lowly children of the shelter'd vale,</br>Like modest worth by scornful pride disdain'd,</br>Your little, fleeting life,</br>Who waste unseen, unknown,", "In verdant veil how bashfully enwrap'd,</br>Ye shun the officious hand, the searchful sight,</br>With down-cast, pensive eye,</br>And ever-musing heads!", "Ah!  when I view your meek, your humble mien,</br>And all your highly breathing fragrance taste,</br>How bleeds my sad'ning soul,</br>For unprotected worth!", "How bleeds to think that mortal excellence</br>Is doom'd to live forgot, unheeded die!</br>For in your short-liv'd charms</br>Are pictur'd well its fate.", "For ye, ere yet the morning's rising gale</br>Shall wing its early course, may cease to greet</br>With the sweet breath of love</br>The wakeful wanderer's way.", "Nor longer, virtue's boast!  a little day,</br>A little hour, she blooms!  Nor can her pow'r</br>Us helpless victims shield</br>From the unpitying grave.", "Then come, my Anna's faithful bosom deck:</br>For ever there true worth, true wisdom dwell,</br>Congenial to your state,</br>Soft in that heaven rest.", "There shall no busy insect dare obtrude</br>Your sweets to rifle with perfidious kiss;</br>While ye more fragrance taste</br>Than in your native beds.", "Your highest incense breathe, to emulate</br>Those more than op'ning morning's purest sweets,</br>That sit on rosy lips</br>Of smiling chastity.</br>"]
