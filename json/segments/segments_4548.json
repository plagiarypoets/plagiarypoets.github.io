["Beautiful Spirit, who dost sit at eve</br>Within thy tapestried hall of shield and spear,</br>Upgazing where the dying sun-beams leave</br>The Heaven in crimson &mdash; on thy cheek a tear</br>Like dew upon the red rose, quivering clear&mdash;</br>From thy pale brow half-raised thy Nun-like blood&mdash;</br>Thy ruby lip half-opened, as to hear</br>Some floating music of the sky or wood&mdash;</br>Come sweet Romance!  from thine enchanted solitude.", "Not for myself I woo thee now to stand</br>Beside the harp.  Loved spirit, spread thy wings,</br>Of veiling splendour, over one whose hand</br>Wakes its first music from the golden rings;</br>For he is thy true votary, and clings</br>To thy fallen altar, with a love sublime,</br>And brings a gift of wild and witching things</br>From glorious Greece &mdash; from the Italian mime,</br>A coronal of gems from the rich depths of time.</br>"]
