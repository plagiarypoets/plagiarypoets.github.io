["'Twas eve and the welkin look'd clear,</br>The lambkins in wantonness stray'd;</br>I mus'd on the charms of my dear,</br>Lain pensively under a shade:</br>A dove on a neighbouring spray,</br>Perch'd, mournfully wailing its mate;</br>I mark'd all the notes of its lay,</br>So nearly resembling my fate.", "My Tray he lay faintly behind,</br>And mark'd ev'ry change in my look;</br>Alas!  were my fair half so kind,</br>I'd willingly handle my crook:</br>You'll say the comparison's vain,</br>But O!  were your tortures like mine?</br>My reason is lost thro' my pain,</br>In deep disappointment I pine.", "Now Sol's bright career was adown,</br>Bland Zephyrus cool'd all the air;</br>The hum of the neighbouring town,</br>Bespoke them dissolving their care:</br>I drove home my flock to their field,</br>And thought that I penn'd them secure;</br>But ah!  with what shame I unfold,</br>I left them devoid of all cure.", "I play'd on my pipe through my grief,</br>And thought that I'd banish dull care;</br>In music find ease and relief,</br>Or humming some fav'rite air;</br>My accents were lost in the strain,</br>My lays they spontaneously flow'd,</br>And move most melodiously plain,</br>To the charms of the fair one I lov'd.", "Ye shepherds no more to the plains,</br>Beware how ye wander or stray,</br>Such woes there await upon swains,</br>Who whilom were sprightly and gay:</br>The graces combine in their maids,</br>To move the most obdurate heart,</br>'Twas innocent haunting those shades</br>Of Cupid, I first felt the smart.", "No more I frequent the sweet groves,</br>Where at morn such fragrance arose,</br>I shun to hear cooing the doves,</br>It renews all the pangs of my woes;</br>I  for e'er bid adieu to the fair,</br>How fair and how constant they be,</br>One only engross'd all my care,</br>But me she thought proper to flee.</br>"]
