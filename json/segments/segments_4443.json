["The moon hath risen o'er the silent height</br>Of the blue vaulted heavens, and each star</br>Is faintly glimmering in its silver light,</br>That dimly shows the mountains tops afar,</br>And lights the fleecy clouds, that form its car,</br>But not obscure its brightness, while around</br>The spell of silence hangs o'er earth and air,</br>And not a rude, intruding voice or sound,</br>Falls on the ear, or mars the solitude profound.", "O nature!  thou art lovely at this hour,</br>Whilst thou art sleeping 'neath this placid ray,</br>Thy charms are in their plenitude of power;</br>And tho' the bounding heart may beat more gay,</br>To view the opening of the joyous day,</br>There is a softer feeling rises now,</br>Tho' not unmix'd with sadness &mdash; and the play</br>Of vivid fancy's bright creative glow,</br>Gives place to higher thoughts &mdash; and nobler feelings flow.", "Bright orb, then art most lovely!  who could gaze</br>With coldness or with carelessness at thee!</br>Or view the earth illumin'd by thy rays,</br>Nor feel the spirit for a moment free</br>From all terrestrial feelings &mdash; can it be,</br>That in thy bosom parted spirits dwell?</br>It may be fancy's whisper, but to me</br>It sounds scarce strangely, tho' my heart may swell</br>To think thou art the home of joy unspeakable.", "This is but wild imagination's flight!</br>Yet a soft witchery is in thy beam,</br>That sheds its influence o'er the gloom of night,</br>And wraps my soul within its magic beam,</br>Till heaven and earth are mingled, and I seem</br>With airy beings of the land of thought,</br>To hold high converse, till I almost deem</br>They are indeed with life and being fraught,</br>And not in fancy's wild creative visions wrought.", "Now come the gathering thoughts of other days,</br>And all the scenes that by-past hours have known;</br>And fancy sheds her reminiscent rays</br>Around the hopes and pleasures that have flown&mdash;</br>And gives again to being every tone,</br>That once was wont to wake our bosoms' swell,</br>When heard from lips of friends, that round us shone</br>Like lovely planets &mdash; till the parting knell</br>Gave token we should bid the last, the sad farewell!", "This is the hour for silent thought, for deep</br>And pure devotion &mdash; while thy placid ray</br>Keeps watch above the world, that rests in sleep&mdash;</br>When all the bustle and the glare of day,</br>And all unquiet thoughts have pass'd away&mdash;</br>Like sinking storms from Ocean's troubled breast,</br>When evening sunbeams o'er its waters play</br>And all the raging of the winds supprest,</br>The waves in heavings soft, sink into quiet rest!</br>"]
