["Not always, dear Licinius, is it wise</br>On the main sea to ply the daring oar;</br>Nor is it safe, in dread of angry skies,</br>To keep too near to the perfidious shore.</br>To no excess discerning spirits lean;</br>They feel the blessings of the golden mean;</br>They will not grovel in the squalid cell,</br>Nor seek in royal domes, with envied pomp to dwell.", "The pine, that lifts so high her stately bough,</br>Writhes in the storms, and withers in their blight,</br>Which o'er the neighbouring trees innoxious blow,</br>That wave their branches in an humbler height.</br>As the loud fury of the whirlwind pours,</br>With direct ruin fall the loftiest towers;</br>And 'tis the mountain's summit that, oblique,</br>From the dark lurid clouds, the baleful lightnings strike.", "The Mind, well disciplined, when Sorrow lowers,</br>Chears her pale eye with Hope's enlivening rays;</br>And when soft Pleasure boasts of lasting powers,</br>With jealous doubt the promiser surveys.</br>It is the same dread Jove, that thro' the sky</br>Hurls the loud storms, that darken as they fly;</br>And whose benignant hand withdraws the gloom,</br>And spreads rekindling light in all its living bloom.", "To-day the soul perceives a weight of woe;</br>A whiter morrow shall gay thoughts inspire;</br>Does Phoebus always been the vengeful bow?</br>Wakes he not often the harmonious lyre?</br>Be thou, when danger scowls in every wave,</br>Watchful, collected, spirited, and brave;</br>But in the sunny skies, the flattering gales,</br>Contract, with steady hand, thy too-expanding sails.</br>"]
