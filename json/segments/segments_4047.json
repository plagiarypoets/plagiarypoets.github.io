["Young world of peace and loveliness, farewell!</br>Farewell to the clear lake; the mountains blue;</br>The grove, whose tufted paths our eyes pursue</br>Delighted; the white cottage in the dell</br>By yon old church; the smoke from that small cell</br>Amid the hills slow rising; and the hue</br>Of summer air, fresh, delicate, and true,</br>Breathing of light and life, the master spell.</br>Work of the poet's eye, the painter's hand,</br>How close to nature art thou, yet how free</br>From earthly stain!  The beautiful, the bland,</br>The rose, the nightingale resemble thee;</br>Thou are most like the blissful fairy-land</br>Of Spenser, or Mozart's fine melody.</br>"]
