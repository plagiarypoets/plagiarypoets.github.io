["Those moments of rapture are fled</br>When peace my fond bosom possess'd,</br>My pleasure how languid and dead,</br>Since Damon, false youth, I caress'd:</br>No more I those pleasures shall share,</br>No more the sweet transport shall prove,</br>When late I'd no cause for to fear,</br>Or doubt of our mutual love.", "Ye nymphs who inhabit the plains,</br>Be cautious in whom you believe;</br>Least like Damon in flattering strains,</br>They court you like him to deceive.</br>The men oft with vows and with sighs,</br>Will melt you to pity and love;</br>While their action their passion denies,</br>And their treach'rous purposes prove.", "Listen not to the tales that they tell,</br>Nor confide in what they declare,</br>When on praising your beauties they dwell,</br>And vow that you're lovely and fair:</br>To each easy damsel they meet,</br>Who will hearken to what they maintain,</br>With false declarations they greet,</br>Then smile at the conquest they gain.", "Whoe'er would have doubted the truth</br>Of what Damon so often declar'd?</br>When honour seem'd form'd in the youth,</br>And his passion so ardent appear'd?</br>How oft while the birds on the spray</br>Did carol the sonets of love,</br>Wou'd Damon with Delia stray</br>Among shades of woodbine to rove?", "But gone are those scenes from my sight,</br>That with him so pleas'd I partook,</br>No more shall I share the delight</br>That I felt at my shepherd's kind look:</br>I'll banish his form from my mind,</br>Nor act as I've oft done before,</br>Since Damon to Delia's unkind</br>I'll never believe a swain more.</br>"]
