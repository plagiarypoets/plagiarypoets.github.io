["Hence, thou fur-clad Winter, fly,</br>Sire of shiv'ring Poverty!</br>Who, as thou creep'st, with chilblains lame,</br>To the crowded charcoal flame,</br>With chattering teeth and ague cold,</br>Scarce thy shaking sides canst hold,</br>Whilst thou draw'st the deep cough out;</br>God of foot-ball's noisy rout,</br>Tumult loud and boist'rous play,</br>The dang'rous slide, the snow-ball fray.", "But come, thou genial Son of Spring,</br>WHITSUNTIDE, and with thee bring</br>Cricket, nimble boy and light,</br>In slippers red, and drawers white,</br>Who, o'er the nicely-measur'd land,</br>Ranges round his comely band,</br>Alert to intercept each blow,</br>Each motion of the wary foe.", "Or patient take thy quiet stand,</br>The angle trembling in thy hand,</br>Kissing the wave, the frequent fly;</br>Where the trout, with eager spring,</br>Forms the many-circled ring,</br>And, leaping from the silver tide,</br>Turns to the sun his speckled side.", "Or lead where Health, a Naiad fair,</br>With rosy cheek, and dropping hair,</br>From the sultry noon-tide beam,</br>Dives in ITCHIN'S crystal stream.</br>Thy votaries, rang'd in order due,</br>To-morrow's wish'd-for dawn shall view</br>Greeting the radiant Star of Light</br>With matin hymn and early rite:</br>Ev'n now, these hallow'd haunts among,</br>To thee we raise the choral song;</br>And swell  with echoing minstrelsy</br>The strain of joy and liberty.", "If pleasures such as these await</br>Thy genial reign, with heart elate</br>For thee I throw my gown aside,</br>And hail thy coming, WHITSUNTIDE.</br>"]
