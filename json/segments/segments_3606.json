["Attend all ye nymphs and swains of the green,</br>For you I have rov'd the plains round,</br>Whole month's I've been prying, and now I have seen,</br>Where smiling Content's to be found.</br>Come quickly with me, and I'll show you the way,</br>To the spot where he chose his retreat;</br>You must fly from these plains to be easy and gay,</br>And near him must take up your seat.", "I sought him 'mongst crouds, and in each gaudy place,</br>But those were the Mansions of Care;</br>In the Palace of Greatness unknown was his face,</br>Contentment had never been there.</br>I hied me to roofs that invited to joys,</br>Hope tempted me thither to rove;</br>But rude was their wit, and their pleasure was noise,</br>Tho' they beckon'd to Peace and to Love.", "At last, near a brook, to a cottage I stray'd,</br>With a few simple sheep on the green;</br>The rose and the woodbine their sweetness display'd,</br>Not Plenty but Health bless'd the scene.</br>Good-Nature appear'd, and unhatch'd me the door,</br>Nor knew what my coming there meant;</br>How great my surprize!  here my search was all o'er,</br>For he told me his name was Content.</br>"]
