["Why didst thou raise such woeful wayle,</br>And waste in briny tears thyne days;</br>Cause shee, that wont to flout and rayl,</br>At last gave proof of woman's waies?</br>Shee did, in soothe, display the hearte</br>That mought have wroughte thee greater smarte.", "Why thank her then, not weep or mone,</br>Let others guard their careless hearte;</br>And praise the day that thus made knowne</br>The faithless hold on woman's art.</br>Their lips can gloze and gain suche roote,</br>That gentle youthe hathe hope of fruite.", "But, ere the blossom fair dothe rise,</br>To shoot its sweetness o'er the taste,</br>Creepeth disdain in canker-wise,</br>And chilling scorne the fruite dothe blaste.</br>There is no hope of all our toyl,</br>There is no fruit from such a soil.", "Give o'er thy playnt, the danger's o'er,</br>Shee might have poyson'd all thyne lyfe;</br>Such wayward mynde had bred thee more</br>Of sorrowe, had shee prov'd a wyfe.</br>Leave her to meet all hopeless meed,</br>And bless thyself that so art freed.", "No youthe shall sue suche one to winne,</br>Unmark'd by all the shyning fair,</br>Save for her pride and scorn, such sinne</br>As hearte of love can never bear:</br>Like leafless plant in blasted shade,</br>So liveth shee a barren mayde.</br>"]
