["Cease, memory, cease to recall,</br>The raptures which lately were mine,</br>When LAURA, tho' sigh'd for by all,</br>To me, to me only was kind!</br>I rose with the lark in the morn,</br>And merrily sung all the day;</br>No shepherd was ever yet born,</br>So blith, so enamour'd so gay.", "When MILO lamented his fate,</br>And call'd giddy JENNY untrue,</br>I banter'd his dastardly gait,</br>And told him I'd teach him to woo:</br>Ah!  little I dreamt that my fair,</br>Would leave me in sorrow to sigh;</br>Now, now is my time for despair!</br>Than MILO more wretched am I.", "At no festive sports now I'm found,</br>Which us'd my gay hours to solace;</br>Deep solitude shrouds me around,</br>And thoughtfulness ruins my peace.</br>I shun now the transparent brook,</br>Which formerly pleas'd me the most,</br>Because it reflects my wan look,</br>So alter'd &mdash; I seem like a ghost.", "In vain I to music resort;</br>Books, too, I apply to in vain;</br>For love in my breast keeps his court,</br>And triumphs &mdash; in spite of disdain.</br>Tho' my sighs with neglect she regards,</br>Tho' my tears she unheeded regards,</br>Tho' my pray'rs she with taunting rewards,</br>Yet LAURA still, still I adore!", "Then, shepherds, I'll bid you adieu,</br>No more my complainings shall teize;</br>The pity I meet with from you,</br>But heightens my hopeless disease.</br>To the bosom of some gloomy grove,</br>Alone, I'll in silence retire,</br>(The last, sad resource of true love!)</br>And, blessing fair LAURA, expire.</br>"]
