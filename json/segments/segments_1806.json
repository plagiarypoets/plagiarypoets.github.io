["He is to weet a melancholy carle:</br>Thin in the waist, with bushy head of hair,</br>As hath the seeded thistle, when in parle</br>It holds the Zephyr, ere it sendeth fair</br>Its light balloons into the summer air;</br>Therto his beard had not begun to bloom,</br>No brush had touch'd his chin, or razor sheer;</br>No care had touch'd his cheek with mortal doom,</br>But new he was, and bright, as scarf from Persian loom.", "Ne cared he for wine, or half-and-half;</br>Ne cared he for fish, or flesh, or fowl,</br>And sauces held he worthless as the chaff;</br>He 'sdeigned the swine-head at the wassail-bowl;</br>Ne with lewd ribbalds sat he cheek by jowl;</br>Ne with sly lemans in the scorner's chair;</br>But after water-brooks this pilgrim's soul</br>Panted, and all his food was woodland air;</br>Though he would oft-times feast on gilliflowers rare.", "The slang of cities in no wise he knew,</br>\"Tipping the wink\" to him was heathen Greek;</br>He sipp'd no \"olden Tom,\" or \"ruin blue,\"</br>Or Nantz, or cherry-brandy, drank full meek</br>By many a damsel brave, and rouge of cheek;</br>Nor did he know each aged watchman's beat,</br>Nor in obscured purlieus would he seek</br>For curled Jewesses, with ankles neat,</br>Who, as they walk abroad, make tinkling with their feet.</br>"]
