["Forget thee?  Never; through life's remnant space,</br>Though peace is blasted, though hope's dream is o'er,</br>Still must the wizard wand of memory trace</br>The vivid past, and ever round me pour</br>The forms of things delusive, now no more!</br>Still, (banish vigorous thought, and high emprise,)</br>Like ocean-farer wrecked on some wild shore,</br>To that deceitful flood I turn my eyes,</br>When life's first, last, loved venture unforgotten lies.", "Ah fool!  to hope for ever-sunny skies,</br>Nor know that nought but magic could invest,</br>With all the blooming hues of paradise,</br>The haunts where airy nothingness doth rest!</br>Mark, where the day's great angel, to the west</br>Receding, hovers o'er the unstable stream,</br>And dips his wing, like fabled islets blest,</br>Mark, how the clouds with transient glories gleam,</br>And on the wave reflect a bright, a parting beam.", "That beam has gone; and hope and joy are fled,</br>And wild romance, and young-ey'd fancy's hour;</br>Bright visions leave me now, and in your stead,</br>Since thus it must be, let the darkness lour;</br>For chilling disappointment's leaden power</br>Has marr'd the genial current in these veins,</br>And given to desolation life's fair flower,</br>E'er since, fond listener to the syren's strain,</br>Of unrequited love, I proved the pointed pain.</br>"]
