["I.</br>On Beds of Daisies idly laid,</br>The Willow waving o'er my Head,</br>Now Morning on the bending Stem,</br>Hangs the round, and glittering Gem,</br>Lull'd by the Lapse of yonder Spring,</br>Of Nature's various Charms I sing:</br>Ambition, Pride, and Pomp adieu!</br>For what has Joy to do with You?", "II.</br>Joy, rose-lipt Dryad loves to dwell</br>In sunny Field, or mossy Cell,</br>Delights on echoing Hills to hear</br>The Reaper's Song, or lowing Steer;</br>Or view with tenfold Plenty spread</br>The crowded Corn-field, blooming Mead;</br>While Beauty, Health, and Innocence</br>Transport the Eye, the Soul, the Sense.", "III.</br>Not fresco'd Roofs, nor Beds of State,</br>Not Guards that round a Monarch wait,</br>Not Crowds of Flatterers can scare</br>From loftiest Courts intruding Care:</br>Midst Odours, Splendors, Banquets, Wine,</br>While Minstrels sound, while Tapers shine,</br>In Sable stole sad Care will come,</br>And darken the gay Drawing-room.", "IV.</br>Nymphs of the Groves, in green array'd,</br>Conduct me to your thickest Shade,</br>Deep in the Bosom of the Vale,</br>Where haunts the lonesome Nightingale;</br>Where Contemplation, Maid divine,</br>Leans against some aged Pine,</br>Wrapt in stedfast Thought profound,</br>Her Eyes fixt stedfast on the Ground.", "V.</br>O Virtue's Nurse!  retired Queen,</br>By Saints alone and Hermits seen,</br>Beyond vain Mortals' Wishes wise,</br>Teach me St. James to despise;</br>For what are crowded Courts, but Schools</br>For Fops, or Hospitals for Fools?</br>Where Slaves and Madmen, Young and Old,</br>Meet to adore some Calf of Gold.</br>"]
