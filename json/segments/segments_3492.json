["Thou, sweet Companion of my lonely Hours,</br>How much I miss thy wonted chearful Song!</br>How much regret thy silent vocal Pow'rs,</br>Thou didst, well pleas'd, from Morn to Night prolong!", "Oft has my Heart by various Cares opprest,</br>By Friend's Neglect, or rich Man's haughty Scorn,</br>Felt from thy festive Notes some Pause of Rest,</br>And lost a-while my Memory's painful Thorn?", "Thy Life small Change by Times or Seasons found,</br>The sullen Winter, or the Summer gay,</br>Saw thee contented thro' their constant Round,</br>Warbling thy Sonnets each succeeding Day.", "Yet, when the Sun his Golden Beams display'd,</br>By sprightlier Motions, and a louder Tone,</br>To his inspiring Pow'r was Homage paid,</br>As if thou felt'st his Deity alone.", "Still with the Tempest's Roar, or Rain's Descent,</br>No sullent Pause disturb'd thy steady Joy;</br>Thro' Nature's Tumult cheering Notes were sent,</br>As if thy Life was form'd above Alloy.", "Oft as my Hand thy Daily Food supply'd,</br>Thy Eye how vivid!  and thy Chirp how sweet!</br>Unlike to Man, thy Debt was ne'er deny'd,</br>With grateful Signs thou did'st my Kindness greet.", "No ling'ring Pains, no slow or dire Disease</br>Were the sad Preludes to thy pleasant Death;</br>One sudden Stroke, and that receiv'd with Ease,</br>Clos'd thy gay Life, and stopp'd thy sighless Breath.", "So the World's Master wish'd to meet his Fate,</br>Afraid to meet it in a solemn Form;</br>Thy Life was harmless, and thy End was great,</br>His Crimes deserv'd it in a ruder Storm.", "O!  could my Days like thine contented flow,</br>And not one Fear, or Care, or Doubt molest;</br>Let Death then finish with one silent Blow,</br>And I, like thee, drop suddenly to Rest.</br>"]
