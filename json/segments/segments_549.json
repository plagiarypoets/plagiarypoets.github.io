["Lo!  where the rosy-bosom'd Hours,</br>Fair VENUS' train appear,</br>Disclose the long-expecting flowers,</br>And wake the purple year!</br>The Attic warbler pours her throat,</br>Responsive to the cuckow's note,</br>The untaught harmony of spring:</br>While whisp'ring pleasure as they fly,</br>Cool Zephyrs thro' the clear blue sky</br>Their gather'd fragrance fling.", "Where'er the oak's thick branches stretch</br>A broader browner shade;</br>Where'er the rude and moss-grown beech</br>O'er-canopies the glade;</br>Beside some water's rushy brink</br>With me the Muse shall sit, and think</br>(At ease reclin'd in rustic state)</br>How vain the ardour of the Crowd,</br>How low, how little are the Proud,</br>How indigent the Great!", "Still is the toiling hand of Care:</br>The panting herds repose:</br>Yet hark, how thro' the peopled air</br>The busy murmur glows!</br>The insect youth are on the wing,</br>Eager to taste the honied spring,</br>And float amid the liquid noon:</br>Some lightly o'er the current skim,</br>Some shew their gayly-gilded trim</br>Quick-glancing to the sun.", "To Contemplation's sober eye</br>Such is the race of Man:</br>And they that creep, and they that fly,</br>Shall end where they began.</br>Alike the Busy and the Gay</br>But flutter thro' life's little day,</br>In fortune's varying colours drest:</br>Brush'd by the hand of rough Mischance,</br>Or chill'd by age, their airy dance</br>They leave, in dust to rest.", "Methinks I hear in accents low</br>The sportive kind reply:</br>Poor moralist!  and what art thou?</br>A solitary fly!</br>Thy Joys no glittering female meets,</br>No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets,</br>No painted plumage to display:</br>On hasty wings thy youth is flown;</br>Thy sun is set, the spring is gone&mdash;</br>We frolick, while 'tis May.</br>"]
