["I. 1.</br>When haughty Caesar's veteran band</br>Britannia's cliffs resolv'd to gain,</br>Thick shades o'erspread the wish'd-for land,</br>And dimm'd the misty main:</br>Save when the lightning's transient glare</br>With flash tremendous fir'd the air,</br>They view'd the warriors on the shore!</br>While Terror grim and wild Despair</br>Uplifted high their bristling hair,</br>Roll'd o'er their hostile heads the thunder's echoing roar.", "I. 2.</br>Silver'd with venerable age,</br>Undaunted step, majestic mien,</br>The bard advanced, with patriot rage,</br>Yet e'en in rage serene.</br>His labouring breast confest his pain;</br>His eye, though fix'd in deep disdain,</br>Still beam'd with pure celestial fire;</br>And seem'd attentive to descry</br>The forms of dark futurity,</br>When this prophetic song burst from th' indignant lyre:", "I. 3.</br>\"Caesar!  what avails thy force,</br>Armed legions, mail-clad horse?</br>What avails thy javelins' shower,</br>Javelins red with human gore?</br>What though thy arms, with wild alarms,</br>Free nations to perdition hurl'd,</br>Thy falchions, blaze, with streaming rays,</br>Appals the trembling world?</br>Victor of victors, mighty lord of lords,</br>See the death advance!  inexorable power!</br>Sheathe!  base assassins, sheathe, your murderous swords!</br>Ah!  who escapes th' inevitable hour!</br>The conqueror, pierc'd with many a gaping wound,</br>Falls by their treacherous hands, and groaning grasps the ground.", "II. 2.</br>\"But hark!  the clarion shrill resounds,</br>With rending clangor rousing war,</br>Each chief deserts th' encircling mounds,</br>And mounts the rattling car.</br>Eagles, threatening eagles rise,</br>And each enrag'd battalion tries</br>To drench the plain with kindred gore;</br>Stalks gaunt Revenge amidst the throng,</br>Rolls his red eyes the slain among,</br>And on her crimson wings hangs slaughter hov'ring o'er.", "II. 3.</br>\"Self-condemn'd the murderers die,</br>On the earth expos'd they lie;</br>Havock!  havock!  ranges round,</br>Hosts of heroes bite the ground!</br>The younger lord, with sanguine sword,</br>Shall make th' affrighted squadrons fly,</br>For in his train, with loosen'd rein,</br>Comes flame-rob'd Victory.</br>But meek-ey'd Mercy, at the mournful scene,</br>Sighs o'er the chief extended on his bier;</br>Pays the pale manes of th' unhappy queen</br>The last sad tribute of a tender tear;</br>While the most baleful of the serpent brood</br>Feasts on her lovely form, and revels in her blood.", "III. 1.</br>\"Romans no more with stern delight</br>View from afar the tented field;</br>No more they rush to deadly fight,</br>No more the spear they wield.</br>Enchanting fiend with azure eye,</br>Th' enrapturing Syren Luxury,</br>Shall all her opening sweets unfold;</br>And scattering from her painted plumes</br>Arabian odours, rich perfumes,</br>Display her purple pinions streak'd with beamy gold.", "III. 2.</br>\"The whelming torrent pours along,</br>When Rome, proud Rome, must meet its fate:</br>The Vandal's death-denouncing throng</br>Now thunders at the gate;</br>Rejoice!  thy tyrant city falls,</br>Lours desolation o'er her walls:</br>By countless myriads opprest,</br>She falls!  with clamour rings the sky:</br>Beneath his standard, fix'd on high,</br>The Goth triumphant waves his many-colour'd crest.", "III. 3.</br>\"Hail!  my native country, hail!</br>Through the tempest-breathing gale,</br>Rushing on, with clouds o'ercast,</br>Furious drives the northern blast;</br>The dusky forms of howling storms,</br>Aloft their awful foreheads rear;</br>And whirlwinds sweep, with cadence deep,</br>Across the angry air:</br>A placid calm succeeds, the Sun's bright beams</br>With added lustre more refulgent glow;</br>The verdant landscape still more verdant seems,</br>The murmuring brooks still more melodious flow;</br>Hail, Britain, hail!\" &mdash; A Roman's whizzing dart,</br>Clos'd the bard's tuneful song, and rent his reeking heart.</br>"]
