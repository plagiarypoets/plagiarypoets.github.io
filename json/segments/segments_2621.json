["Ah!  why do I silently grieve,</br>Or, pensive, recline by the brook?</br>Why the doubts of young Phillis believe,</br>\"That Mira my cot has forsook?\"", "Perhaps, when the evening's dew</br>Has fall'n on the pasture and plain,</br>The wandering fair I may view,</br>And pleasure succeed for my pain.", "'Tis true, she has sense and pure wit,</br>Each list'ner to charm and surprize;</br>And e'en stoics would freely admit</br>They lustre receive &mdash; from her eyes.", "My sheep now to covert have fled;</br>Bright Sol has to Thetis retir'd;</br>The owl too complains on the shed;</br>(This gloom how by lovers admir'd!)", "But I for the maiden will roam,</br>O Luna, refulge till the day!</br>If I bring the fair traveller home,</br>Her smiles will my anguish repay.", "Alas!  should my search be in vain,</br>And Mira with Damon retire;</br>Adieu to the sweets of the plain,</br>For, hope in my breast will expire.</br>"]
