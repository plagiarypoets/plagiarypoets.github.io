["Live Spenser ever, in thy Fairy Queene:</br>Whose like (for deepe Conceit) was never seene.</br>Crownd mayst thou bee, unto thy more renowne,</br>(As King of Poets) with a Lawrell Crowne.", "And Daniell, praised for thy sweet-chast Verse:</br>Whose Fame is grav'd on Rosamonds blacke Herse.</br>Still mayst thou live:  and still be honored,</br>For that rare Worke, The White Rose and the Red.", "And Drayton, whose wel-written Tragedies,</br>And sweete Epistles, soare thy fame to skies.</br>Thy learned Name, is aequall with the rest;</br>Whose stately Numbers are so well addrest.", "And Shakespeare thou, whose hony-flowing Vaine,</br>(Pleasing the World) thy Praises doth obtaine.</br>Whose Venus, and whose Lucrece (sweete, and chaste)</br>Thy Name in fames immortall Booke have plac't.</br>Live ever you, at least in Fame live ever:</br>Well may the Bodye dye, but Fame dies never.</br>"]
