["When lately I offer'd Eunica to kiss,</br>She fleer'd, and she flouted, and took it amiss;</br>\"Begone, you great booby,\" she cry'd with a frown,</br>\"Do you think that I long to be kiss'd by a clown?</br>The sparks of the city my kisses esteem;</br>You never shall kiss me, no, not in a dream.</br>How pleasing your look!  and how gently you play!</br>How soft is your voice!  and what fine things you say!</br>So neat is your beard, and so comely your hair!</br>Your hands are so white, and your lips, a sweet pair!</br>But on your dear person I never shall doat;</br>So pray keep your distance &mdash; you smell like a goat.\"</br>Thus spake the pert hussy, and view'd me all round</br>With an eye of disdain, and thrice spit on the ground,</br>Look'd proud of her charms, with an insolent sneer,</br>And sent me away with a flea in my ear.</br>My blood quickly boil'd in a violent pique,</br>And, red as a rose, passion glow'd in my cheek;</br>For it vex'd me, that thus in derision she jeer'd</br>My looks, and my voice, and my hair, and my beard.", "But, am I not handsome, ye shepherds, say true?</br>Or has any God alter'd my person anew?</br>For lately, on oaks like the ivy, with grace</br>My hair and my beard added charms to my face:</br>My eye-brows were sable, my forehead milk-white,</br>And my eyes, like Minerva's, were azure and bright;</br>My lips, sweet as cream, were with music replete,</br>For from them flow'd sounds as the honey-comb sweet:</br>My songs are enchanting; nor ought can exceed</br>The tunes of my pipe, or the notes of my reed,</br>The girls of the country, if they had their wills,</br>Wou'd kiss me, and press me to stay on the hills;</br>For they say, that I'm fair:  but this flirt of the town</br>Refus'd my sweet kisses, and call'd me a clown.</br>Alas!  she forgot, or perhaps did not know,</br>That Bacchus fed herds in the valley below;</br>That Venus a swain lov'd with with hearty good will,</br>And help'd him his cattle to tend on the hill;</br>Adonis, while living, in groves she ador'd,</br>And dead in the groves and on mountains deplor'd.</br>If right my conjecture, Endymion, I ween,</br>Like me too once tended his steers on the green;</br>Yet the Moon in this neatherd took such a delight,</br>That she met him at Latmos, and kiss'd him all night.</br>Ev'n Cybele mourn'd for a herdsman; and Jove</br>Snatch'd a boy from his herd to be waiter above.", "But Eunica disdains me, nor lists to my vow;</br>Is she better than Cynthia, or Cybele, trow?</br>Does she think that in bloom, and the beauty of face</br>She is equal to Venus?  if that be the case;</br>May she never behold sweet Adonis again</br>On the hill, in the vale, in the city or plain;</br>And may the proud minx, for her crime to atone,</br>If she can, sleep contented &mdash; but always alone!</br>"]
