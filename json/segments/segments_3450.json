["May I, while health and strength remains,</br>And blood flows warm within my veins;</br>Find out some virgin, soft and kind,</br>Who is to social joy inclin'd;</br>A nymph who can for me forgo,</br>The fop, the fribble, and the beau;</br>From noise and show, content can be,</br>To live at home with love and me:</br>Such pleasures Love and Hymen give,</br>And such a life I wish to live.</br>"]
