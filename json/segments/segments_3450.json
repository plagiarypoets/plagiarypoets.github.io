["Alexis, the pride of the plain,</br>Beside a clear brook lay reclin'd,</br>His complaint was fair Daphne's disdain,</br>Who had prov'd to the shepherd unkind.</br>His flock was no longer his care,</br>His pipe now no longer could please,</br>He neglected his dress and his hair,</br>And by solitude fed his disease.", "Poor shepherd!  he wildly exclaim'd,</br>Alas!  what avails all thy moan?</br>The joys thy fond fancy had fram'd,</br>With Daphne for ever are flown!</br>How could you, Oh!  Daphne, deceive,</br>A swain not unworthy your love?</br>Why didst thou, Alexis, believe,</br>Such a maid could thy passion approve?", "Her form is replete with each grace,</br>The diamond beams forth in her eye,</br>The lily expands o'er her face,</br>And the rose-bud imparts its soft dye.</br>No warbler can rival her song,</br>Philomela with envy complains,</br>The streams glide in silence along,</br>The glad Zephyrs diffuse her soft strains.", "When Daphne appear'd in the mead,</br>Her presence enliven'd the morn,</br>Now the winds roughly blow round my head,</br>And the sun's cheerful beams are withdrawn.</br>No longer these meadows look green,</br>Now the warblers abandon the grove,</br>The air breathes no longer serene,</br>All summer is fled with my love!", "Oh!  Daphne, you heard my fond sighs,</br>You did not my passion disdain,</br>When I gaz'd with delight on your eyes,</br>My soft glances you did not restrain!</br>But now you make sport of my woes,</br>And laugh at the sufferings I feel,</br>I enjoy not the sweets of repose,</br>Nor can I my torments conceal!", "Farewell ye sad scenes of my love,</br>I shall never revisit you more!</br>Adieu to the mead and the grove,</br>'Twas here I first learn'd to adore!</br>I will banish this wretch from her sight,</br>I know not what fate may ensue,</br>Never more can I taste of delight,</br>To ev'ry enjoyment adieu!", "PART THE SECOND.</br>With a torrent of heart-bursting grief,</br>Alexis continues his moan,</br>Tears gave him some little relief,</br>Yet he ceas'd not to sigh and to groan.</br>Pastora, by chance hasten'd by,</br>She saw the poor shepherd's despair,</br>Soft pity appear'd in her eye,</br>She ask'd him the source of his care.", "What cause has Alexis to weep?</br>With looks of compassion, she said.</br>Have you lost e'er a lamb or a sheep?</br>Or, is Tray the poor favourite dead?</br>Or, perhaps your fair Daphne's unkind,</br>Perhaps for her coyness you grieve,</br>Ah!  'tis jealousy poisons your mind!</br>But appearances often deceive.", "The shepherd just rais'd up his head,</br>He thank'd the kind maid for her care,</br>He confess'd that all comfort was fled,</br>And nothing was left but despair.</br>Pastora ev'n wept at the tale,</br>And wish'd she could ease his distress,</br>Could her Int'rest with Daphne prevail,</br>His suff'ring should soon find redress.", "He gaz'd on the fair with surprize,</br>And admir'd the good-nature she shew'd;</br>When she went he withdrew not his eyes,</br>But with pleasure her footsteps pursu'd.</br>Her sweetness, her beauty, and truth,</br>With Daphne's late falsehood compar'd,</br>So charm'd, so astonish'd the youth,</br>That his heart for a change was prepar'd.", "Yet still his fond wish would arise,</br>Ah!  was but my Daphne thus kind!</br>I would wipe off these tears from my eyes,</br>And give up my sighs to the wind!</br>He said, and arose from the ground,</br>Then instant return'd to his cot,</br>Soon in sleep ev'ry suff'ring was drown'd,</br>And Daphne's unkindness forgot.", "With the sun the next morn he arose,</br>Pastora he sought in the grove,</br>He repeated the tale of his woes,</br>And mourn'd the sad fate of his love!</br>Pastora heard ev'ry complaint;</br>Again he imparted his grief,</br>He talk'd without fear or constraint,</br>And found from her converse, relief.", "The friendship he felt for the fair,</br>Each meeting still serv'd to improve;</br>He then blest his late cause of despair,</br>And became a true votary to love.</br>'Twas no longer for beauty he sigh'd,</br>He no longer to merit was blind,</br>'Twas his joy, and a laudable pride,</br>That he valued the charms of the mind.", "Pastora, with blushes confest,</br>That he felt all the force of true love,</br>But that reason her passion supprest,</br>Yet that now she must own and approve.</br>She soon gave her hand to the swain,</br>Who proclaim'd to each shepherd this truth;</br>He had met a reward for his pain,</br>More lasting than beauty and youth.", "When spring decks with verdure the mead,</br>Love wafts milder fragrance around;</br>When summer invites to the shade,</br>Love strews with fresh flow'rets the ground.</br>In autumn thro' corn-fields they rove,</br>And their loves as in spring-time appear,</br>Tho' winter disrobes the known grove,</br>Yet their love varies not with the year.", "Ye nymphs to this maxim attend,</br>Tho' beauty a while may allure,</br>Yet, to fix in the lover, the friend,</br>'Tis virtue alone is secure!</br>Ye swains, who are caught by a face,</br>Know, that beauty will quickly decay,</br>That virtue still heightens each grace,</br>And imparts, more than time steals away!</br>"]
