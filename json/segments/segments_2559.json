["O Reverend Sire!  hide not with bashful care</br>Thy aged form; nor Pride's fastidious frown,</br>Nor cold Aversion's start</br>Forbid thy meek approach.", "Soft Sympathy beholds thy care-bent back,</br>Thy hoary hairs that thinly veil thy head,</br>Thy furrow'd front of woe,</br>With many a heart-felt sigh.", "Ah, look not so! &mdash; Methinks thy alter'd face,</br>Smooth'd with a smile, my father's likeness wears,</br>Thus the dim spark of age</br>Illumes his feeble eye.", "O eye, thou faithful picture of the soul!</br>When Time has robb'd the intellectual store,</br>Scarce one poor ray of thought</br>Breaks thro' the gather'd gloom.</br>"]
