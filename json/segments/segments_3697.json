["Old Ludlow moulders 'neath the hand of age,</br>Grey worn her towers, and fall'n her battled heights;</br>Still lives her fame, for on th' historic page</br>Are stamp'd the glories of her antient fights.", "Yes &mdash; Ludlow sinks in ruin's dark array,</br>Though Kings and Princes once have throng'd her halls;&mdash;</br>Though Britain's early senate there held sway,</br>And England's banners wav'd above her walls;", "No more her gallery with loud music rings,</br>Where Cambrian harpers woke their song of glee,&mdash;</br>Where wither'd hands swept o'er the yielding strings,</br>And smiling beauties welcom'd minstrelsy.", "No more the banquet throngs the woods around,</br>Where merry masquers danc'd beneath the stars,</br>And echo mock'd them with an endless sound,</br>And the moon lit them to their gallant wars.", "Amidst the wreck and battlements o'erblown,</br>And crumbling columns, winter's voice doth howl,</br>There, where rude moss and ivy green have grown,</br>Flits the night bat, and solemn-seeming owl.", "And oft the peasant, journeying on his way,</br>Starts into fear, and listens at the sound;</br>And when the sunk Sun calls from earth the day,</br>No lingering footstep dares to tread the ground.", "The toiling spade, and the laborious plough,</br>Forcing their way through sand, and earth, and stones,</br>Oft find, sequester'd 'mid hoar roots below,</br>A conqueror's skull with parch'd and storm-worn bones,", "A massy spear, a ponderous helm beside;&mdash;</br>A shrivell'd arm, once form'd the sword to wield;&mdash;</br>A trunk now 'rest of all its earthly pride,</br>Whose tongue spoke death and terror thro' the field;&mdash;", "A coin, to which the stamp of time hath clung,</br>Which some crowned head, or learn'd inscription bore,</br>When camps and conquerors, kings and fame, were young:</br>Tis now effaced &mdash; and Glory lives no more.</br>"]
