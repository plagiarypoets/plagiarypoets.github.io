["ERIN, Forgive!  that of thy lovely Land,</br>Presumptuous have I dared so long to sing;</br>Attempting theme, that needed master-hand,</br>A golden Harp, and swept by Angel's wing.</br>But 'twas Affection led me to the string,</br>I felt a troubled joy, a strange desire,</br>Swell in my bosom, as thy bravest King</br>And Chiefs of other days in rude attire</br>Pass'd dim before mine eyes, and swept the feeble wire.", "'Tis sweet to mark the consecrated spot,</br>Where Warriors won, and Minstrels sung their praise;</br>Where Virtue comforted, and Valor fought,</br>While Memory wakes the joys of other days,</br>And with enchantment every scene arrays:</br>But oh!  when Country's woven in the spell,</br>How do we cherish each sad caring trace,</br>That of her ancient majesty can tell,</br>Of wars which ERIN fought, and fields where Lochlin fell.", "Thus is it when, the Warrior's heart has ceased</br>To beat, as once it did, to Glory's thrill,</br>Memory retails the thoughts that swelled his breast,</br>And, tho' with feebler throbbings, feels them still;</br>But now, farewell!  each tower, each fairy-rill,</br>That drew me, ERIN!  to thy praise: &mdash; the while</br>May each enchanting vale &mdash; each shadowing hill&mdash;</br>With Virtue, Pietry, and Friendship, smile,</br>And Peace, and Freedom, bless thro' time thy lovely Isle.</br>"]
