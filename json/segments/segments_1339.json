["As REASON, fairest daughter of the skies,</br>Explor'd the vale, where mortal mis'ry lies;</br>Led on by FORTITUDE, with eye serene,</br>She mark'd each object of the varying scene;</br>In ev'ry maze of busy LIFE she found</br>Some hidden SNARE, some agonizing WOUND;</br>For each her hand display'd a precious balm,</br>Whose pow'r divine the tortur'd soul could calm;</br>Till midway, on a rock of dreadful height,</br>The CAVE of CURELESS WOE assail'd her wond'ring sight!", "On the bleak threshold, with'ring and forlorn,</br>Heart-wounded MELANCHOLY sat reclin'd!</br>The rude blast scatter'd her dishevel'd hair;</br>Round her cold brow the deadly NIGHTSHADE twin'd!</br>Near, on a craggy point, stood wild DESPAIR,</br>Whose pangs supreme all lesser miseries scorn!</br>And as the gaunt tormentor, smiling, view'd</br>The pensive child of Sorrow, soul-subdu'd;</br>With taunting mien, she beckon'd from below</br>The fierce, relentless BANDS, of DESOLATING WOE!", "First, swift as lightning up the flinty steep</br>IMPATIENCE flew, barefooted, out of breath;</br>Scorning the perils of the dreadful sweep;</br>Heedless of wounding THORNS, and threat'ning DEATH.</br>Eager to rush the foremost of the train,</br>She FEAR'D not danger, and she FELT not pain:</br>With longing eye she view'd the tow'ring height;</br>From PEAK to PEAK, quick climbing with delight,</br>She PASS'D the FATAL CAVE; then turning short,</br>Fell headlong from the rock, OF EV'RY FIEND THE SPORT!", "Then HORROR darted forth, in wild amaze!</br>Her hair erect, with pois'nous HEMLOCK bound;</br>Her straining eye-balls flashing fires around,</br>While NATURE trembled at her potent gaze!</br>Swift to the dizzy precipice she flew,</br>As, aiming with impetuous force to throw</br>Her giant form amidst the gulph below!</br>When, from an ivy'd nook obscure, PALE FEAR</br>Peep'd forth, slow whisp'ring to her startled ear,</br>\"Think not the pow'r of DEATH THY mis'ries will subdue!\"", "Then HORROR bent her blood-shot eyes below,</br>Where, by a group of DEMONS compass'd round,</br>Lay SUICIDE ACCURS'D!

 languid she seemed, and pale,</br>Restless, and sated with voluptuous fare;</br>Beside her pillow, hung with trappings rare,</br>Stood trembling PALSY, ready to assail;</br>And writhing AGONY, and slow DECAY,</br>And hood-winked VICE abhorr'd, that shunn'd the EYE OF DAY.", "Next, with a solemn, slow, and feeble pace,</br>Came silent POVERTY, in tatter'd vest!</br>The frequent tears, that glisten'd on her breast,</br>Had fretted channels down her meagre face!</br>A rabble crew of IDIOTS dinn'd her ear:</br>While mean REPROACH came smiling in the rear.</br>With firm, yet modest look, she pass'd along;</br>Nor sought relief, nor mark'd the taunting throng;</br>While her wrung heart, still scorning to complain,</br>SUPPRESS'D the rending groan, and throbb'd WITH PROUD DISDAIN.", "Close at her heels, insidious ENVY CREPT;</br>The IMP, deform'd, and horrible in shape,</br>Mock'd, when the slow-consuming victim wept,</br>Pointing, and grinning, like a wither'd APE:</br>About her throat, the ASP DETRACTION clung,</br>Scatt'ring destructive poisons from her tongue!</br>She wav'd a BLASTED LAUREL o'er her head,</br>Stol'n from the SACRED ASHES of the DEAD;</br>Inly she pin'd; while in her panting breast,</br>Shrunk IGNORANCE struck its fangs, to BANISH GENTLE REST.", "In a lone corner, almost hid in shade,</br>With downcast eye, sat UNREQUITED LOVE!</br>As from their hollow cell the slow tears stray'd,</br>A willow garland for his brow he wove!</br>Low at his feet, bare MADNESS laid his head,</br>Rattling his chains, upon his flinty bed!</br>Rous'd from his stupor, by the clanking sound,</br>The pensive youth gaz'd fearfully around;</br>And wond'ring to behold such mis'ry near,</br>FORGOT his mournful WREATH, and dropp'd a PITYING TEAR.", "Now, lab'ring up the flinty winding road,</br>Laden with treasure, bending to the ground,</br>Appear'd lean AVARICE!
