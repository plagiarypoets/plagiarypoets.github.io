["\"There is a living spirit in the lyre\"&mdash;</br>'Tis true; but if a hand unskill'd should dare</br>To wake its chords without the genuine fire,</br>The inspiration which but few can share,</br>Would that soul-thrilling harmony be there?</br>That wild, ecstatic, overwhelming madness,</br>Which lifts the mind beyond each earthly care,</br>And turns its thoughts of anguish into gladness,</br>Or leaves, at least, behind a mild and pleasing sadness?", "It could not be; the vain attempt would bring</br>Derision on the self-confiding wight,</br>Who dar'd to strike the muse's hallow'd string,</br>Nor knew to guide its symphonies aright:</br>Yet such, methinks, am I; my upward flight</br>Is clogg'd and stay'd by gross terrestrial things;</br>And if, by chance, a beam of heavenly light</br>Should break upon my spirit's wanderings,</br>How fleeting is the joy its transient radiance brings.", "I fain would soar above this lower sphere,</br>And, eagle-like, mount upward to the skies:</br>My ardent soul disdains to linger here,</br>And with those master spirits longs to rise,</br>Who sought and won the invaluable prize,</br>The meed of never-dying, endless fame:</br>Though dead to earth their memory never dies,</br>It is a spark of an immortal flame,</br>Quenchless as is the source from whence at first it came.", "'Tis pleasant in the sleepless dreams of thought,</br>To let imagination rove at will&mdash;</br>Through many a future year with pleasure fraught;</br>But in our sober moments comes a thrill,</br>Which tells us that they are but visions still:</br>So 'tis with all my aspirations high;</br>Though, for awhile, they may my bosom fill</br>With hopes of fame, at reason's touch they fly,&mdash;</br>As when the sun appears the darkness passeth by.", "Yet will I not forsake the flowery ways</br>Of poesy, which I have trod so long;</br>Though mine may be but rude, unpolish'd lays,</br>I cannot live without the light of song;</br>Its beams have oft dispell'd the dreary throng,</br>Of dark despairing thoughts which haunt my breast:</br>Then who can blame me that I would prolong</br>The dear delusion which has brought me rest,</br>When I might else have sunk by care and grief oppress'd?", "Surely, my gentle friend, thou wilt not be</br>A rigid judge, though such a strain as mine</br>Is far beneath thy glowing minstrelsy;</br>Poetic bays I willingly resign;</br>But as a dimly-twinkling star may shine</br>Amid surrounding gloom, my humble lays</br>May faintly glow till swallow'd up by thine,&mdash;</br>And, lost amid their bright, unclouded blaze,</br>They cease to shed around their dim and feeble rays.</br>"]
