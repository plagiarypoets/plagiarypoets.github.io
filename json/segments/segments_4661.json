["Take a small cot, or rural cell,</br>And in it let young Damon dwell;</br>With youthful Thyrsis; happy pair,</br>Free from all noises, or worldly care.</br>Let Thyrsis be young Damon's theme;</br>And don't forget the purling stream;</br>For that will serve upon a time,</br>To make a sim'le, or a rhime.</br>Next you must have a cypress shade,</br>That seems for weeping lovers made:</br>Then let young Damon mournful tell,</br>How doleful seem'd the parting knell</br>Of Corydon, the happiest swain,</br>That sung, or danc'd, or trip'd the plain.</br>Or you may take some other name,</br>'Twill serve your purpose just the same:</br>So as, 'twill run off smooth in verse,</br>When you've occasion to rehearse</br>Their noble virtues, wit, and sense;</br>Or penetration, how immense!</br>Next blast an aged oak or two,</br>Where Corydon was wont to go;</br>Be sure and wither too the flow'rs;</br>The well known walks, the shady bow'rs.</br>Then for to season well your piece,</br>And give the whole a proper grace;</br>\"Say, oft at eve my careless limbs I throw,\"</br>On flow'ry banks, to vent my strains of woe.</br>"]
