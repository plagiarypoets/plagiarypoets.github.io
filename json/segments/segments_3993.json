["See!  Winter once more quits the plains!</br>And Spring does their verdure restore;</br>How pleas'd are the nymphs and the swains,</br>Since now the cold season is o'er.", "The streams now flow swiftly again,</br>The ice now dissolves in the flood,</br>The trees now their foliage regain,</br>For see yon green neighbouring wood!", "Now Hodge with the milk-maid appears,</br>And carries her pail with much glee;</br>She smiles, when his love he declares,</br>How blest and contented is he!", "The shepherds repair to the plain,</br>From whence they long absent have been;</br>With pleasure they meet there again,</br>And dance round their flocks on the green,", "With Daphne I visit the grove,</br>The birds all so chearful appear,</br>And warble the songs of the their love,</br>To welcome the spring of the year.</br>"]
