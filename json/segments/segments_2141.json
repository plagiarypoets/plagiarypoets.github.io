["Thou mighty pow'r unseen, yet felt and heard</br>(For now I feel thy pinions cross my cheek,</br>And hear thy voice, and oft articulate word,</br>At lonely midnight have I heard thee speak;)</br>O stay thy rapid footsteps, for I seek</br>To know thee, and from whence thou comest, and where</br>Thy going is, when thou hast ceased to break,</br>With the wild strife of elemental war,</br>Light zephyr's soft repose, calm slumbering in the air.", "In Ocean's gloomy caverns dost thou dwell?</br>Or is thy habitation in the skies?</br>What mystic form does herald thy assail</br>To the bold seaman, ere the waves arise</br>To mountain billows, and the vessel flies,</br>Like a sear leaf before thy withering blast?</br>O thou art wonderful!  thought prostrate lies</br>Before thee as a deity:  how fast</br>Thou hast been hurrying past me, yet thou art not past!", "All things created have a form but thee.</br>How like a God the sun pursues his way</br>Diffusing life and beauty!  but we see</br>From whence proceeds the vivifying ray:</br>Thy steps are on the ocean, on the earth,</br>And far above, the clouds thy will obey.</br>Before the heaven and earth, wert thou brought forth?</br>Or, did this globe, in space, produce thy mighty birth?", "Of all the created things, within the ken</br>Of human knowledge, thou resemblest most</br>The Great Original; and there are men,</br>So far in their own mazy reasoning lost,</br>Who say, thou art the Mighty One, that dost</br>Guide with a skilful hand this ponderous earth.</br>How wild and weak the subtle reasoners boast!</br>The same Almighty Cause did give thee birth,</br>That brought the globe, the heaven, and all existence forth.</br>"]
