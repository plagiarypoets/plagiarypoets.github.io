["Fair Thamis' Stream, that from Lud's stately Town,</br>Runst, paying Tribute to the Ocean Seas,</br>Let all thy Nymphs and Syrens of Renown</br>Be silent, while this Briton Orpheus plays:</br>Near thy sweet Banks, there lives that sacred Crown,</br>Whose Hand strows Palm and never-dying Bayes;</br>Let all at once, with thy soft murmuring soun,</br>Present her with this worthy Poet's Praise.</br>For he hath taught high Drifts in Shepherds Weeds,</br>And deep Conceits now sings in Fairies Deeds.</br>"]
