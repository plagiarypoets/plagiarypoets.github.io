["On thy suburban bank, fair Harrow-weald!</br>Although thine airy downs are now enclos'd,</br>And tasteless ploughshares furrow up each field,</br>Yet once the Laureat's verse-fill'd head repos'd:</br>Alas, those eyes in cloud-capp'd night are clos'd!</br>Now from his grave alone sweet wild-flowers spring,</br>(His grave of briar'd turf, and moss compos'd)</br>Wild-flowers he gather'd when on earth, to fling</br>O'er Britain's matchless Queen, o'er Britain's matchless King.", "Oft, where the humble-bee, with buzzing hum,</br>At many-colour'd evening's careless hour,</br>Seem'd, by the whispering air, in act to come,</br>And rous'd the viewless myriads round his bower,</br>P&mdash;e too would buzz and hum &mdash; the song-soul'd power</br>Of court-born panegyric on his tongue;</br>His ivy-mantled brow like some grey tower</br>Enwreath'd with frontlet green, which off he flung,</br>To deck that Queen and King, whom ceaselessly he sung.", "But now&mdash;</br>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</br>And, if Hope's faded pleasures the bosom thus melt,</br>What has Memory more of such pain to be felt?</br>"]
