["When forc'd from the maid I adore,</br>What torments oppress my fond heart!</br>Yet in vain I her absence deplore,</br>Since by fate we are destin'd to part.", "No longer we range the gay fields,</br>Where vi'lets and primroses grow;</br>Where nature each fragrance yields,</br>And streams in soft murmurings flow.", "Depriv'd of my Phillis's charms,</br>No pleasure, alas!  can I find;</br>No peace I enjoy from her arms,</br>Nor to mirth am I ever inclin'd.", "Neglected my lambkins now stray,</br>In vain doth each flow'ret appear;</br>In vain too the meadows look gay,</br>Since Phillis (fair maid) is not here!", "Ye shepherds who, blest with content,</br>Each day in tranquillity spend;</br>O cease not my fate to lament,</br>Since my sorrows in absence can't end.", "The landscapes no longer delight,</br>No murmuring rills give repose;</br>How joyless each day and each night,</br>And the plain is the scene of my woes!", "O Phillis!  then come to my arms,</br>Thou lovely, engaging, sweet fair;</br>For when I am blest with your charms,</br>Then only I'm free from despair.</br>"]
