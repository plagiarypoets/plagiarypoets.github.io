["Idol of all, the world's imperial lord,</br>Thou peerless bullion dug from sleeping earth,</br>As sways the despot o'er his fettered horde,</br>So thousands bow the minions of thy worth:&mdash;</br>To groans and midnight tears thou givest birth,</br>Enchanting master of the frown and smile;&mdash;</br>Alike creator of our woes and mirth,</br>The nurse of cloudy hate, and venomed guile,</br>Diffusing mantling grandeur on the tumid vile!", "Thou yellow slave of Eastern rifled mine,</br>There gleams from thee a long unweakened charm;</br>A fatal essence is for ever thine</br>That time's corroding changes harm;</br>The same magnetic spell in every form&mdash;</br>A dumb memorial of the ages fled,</br>When, love for thee, woke up the civic storm;&mdash;</br>For thee, the pulsing breast was gored and red,</br>And savage warriors trampled on the piling dead:", "There is a moral on thy graven face,</br>When, damp before us, from thy burial-ground,</br>With eager ken, we scan the fading trace</br>Of some triumphant record, crusted round;</br>Or regal brow, with braiding garland bound.</br>Where now is he, the image of thy rust?</br>The tyrant, perhaps, that made the war-whoop sound,</br>And vanquished cities rear his sculptured bust&mdash;</br>Like thee, disfigured remnant of his wormy dust!", "In burning zones, and far exotic clime,</br>Where gorgeous nature daunts the lifted eye,&mdash;</br>The daring Briton wastes his lusty prime,</br>Apart from native hills, and genial sky:</br>The dripping tears of love &mdash; th' unbosomed sigh,</br>The farewell pang prophetic &mdash; all forgot!</br>When, flushed, his pluming spirit longs to fly</br>From thrifty ease and patrimonial spot&mdash;</br>And slow return with wealth and fevered veins his lot!", "With sinking cheek, pale lip, and pensive glance,</br>And locks that pine upon their heated brow,</br>Alone, with pauseful step, and mute advance,</br>Behold a martyred genius passing now!</br>His eyes still flash, &mdash; but mournful shadows throw</br>Betraying sadness round his inward gloom:&mdash;</br>The soul is lit, inspired, &mdash; but poor, and low,</br>No gold creative to resist his doom,</br>Like sunshine's fading light, he weakens to the tomb.", "On clotted turf, within a murky vale,</br>The blood-red daggers in his quaking hand,</br>His guilty visage hued by moonlight pale,&mdash;</br>The murderer bodes &mdash; as if Remorse's wand</br>Had fixed him there.  Upon the still brigand,</br>The victim opes his eyes &mdash; which then reclose,</br>While from his wounds the bubbling streams expand:</br>For gold, thus, oft the wasting life-spring flows&mdash;</br>For thee, vile ore, how many woo the grave's repose!", "A long farewell endears the faithful soul,</br>And warmer kindness will spring up from woe,&mdash;</br>But spelling gold perverts the heart's control,</br>And finds a parent for the infant's foe!</br>Malignant guile, the darksome traitor's blow,</br>The death-bed curse, and lip of venom'd scorn,&mdash;</br>The sternest pangs enduring hearts can know,</br>Are but the deeds  of gold: &mdash; and years unborn,</br>Shall bring thine endless victims, that for thee shall mourn.", "But see!  thy abject slave: &mdash; a lurking fear,</br>Spreads o'er his face a dark prevailing shade;</br>Wakeful, though scowled his gaze: &mdash; that icy sneer,</br>Before whose chill a baby smile would fade,&mdash;</br>Is th' intense pride of treasure unbetrayed:</br>Few are his words &mdash; in them the wily tone</br>Conveys reserveful dread; &mdash; as if it bade</br>The miser fear himself: &mdash; his wealth once known,</br>'Twould seem departed, though it still remained his own!", "A miser's heart is like the damp cold tomb,</br>Embalming but the noisome; &mdash; dark abode</br>Of blighted feeling and of selfish gloom:&mdash;</br>And yet 'tis not repose; a burdening load</br>Of teasing dreams, at home, and on the road,</br>From risen morn till eve &mdash; prevent his rest:</br>One  haunting thought, the self-inflicted goad&mdash;</br>Is ever at his soul.  With heavy breast</br>And pulsing terror, is his canvas pillow pressed!", "This beauteous world, and its enchanting scene,</br>The silken clouds of morn, and moony night,</br>The tinted fruits, and meadow's matchless green,&mdash;</br>Its flowers and streams &mdash; for him yield no delight!&mdash;</br>The sunbeams warm his brow, and bless his sight,</br>The breezes kiss his lips &mdash; but he's the same:&mdash;</br>As if his mind was darkened o'er with blight,</br>And Nature quite unfelt &mdash; a gloomy frame</br>Where all, but avarice, is motionless and tame.", "And has he bliss? &mdash; 'tis buried in the ground!</br>No kindly ease is bought above:  vile, mean,</br>Blank to the eye, and deaf to sorrow's sound,</br>With unpartaking modes and bilous spleen,</br>He crawls his way &mdash; unsought and seldom seen:&mdash;</br>Strange homage this, that Fancy gets</br>For her delusions!  E'er since time hath been,</br>Hearts weave their own deceits: &mdash; the miser frets,</br>But bears the willing thraldom while his SOUL regrets!", "With lowering front, and dim withdrawing eye,</br>Suspiciously he creeps: &mdash; his morbid glance</br>Turned round on heaven and earth most fretfully;&mdash;</br>Disturbing fears, as near his steps advance</br>To see the buried gold &mdash; and hopeful trance,&mdash;</br>Attend him with their phantoms. &mdash; Each limb shakes,</br>And tremulous, the chills of dubious chance</br>Thrill through his person: &mdash; till again he takes</br>Another glutting stare, &mdash; oh!  how his bosom aches!", "The spot is gained: &mdash; beneath a tree decayed</br>His treasure's hid.  Upon its topmost bough</br>A raven sits &mdash; foreboding hope betrayed.</br>Here, on the ground, the miser kneeling now,</br>Digs up the turf: &mdash; but list!  the shrieking vow</br>And arms infuriate raised &mdash; the torture's trace&mdash;</br>Proclaim the heap is gone! &mdash; no tears can flow,</br>But inward anguish maddens in grimace,</br>While Death, with mocking purse, grins in his martyr's face.</br>"]
