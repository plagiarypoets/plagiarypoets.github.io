["I lay upon a bank with harebells strown;</br>For now the ruddy Sun was growing pale,</br>And here and there a star was glittering lone,</br>And rich with odours from the blossomed vale</br>Came slowly as a sigh the evening gale.</br>Then all was hush'd &mdash; but where with folded wing</br>Above me cooed the turtle-dove her tale,</br>And, thro' the grass, a little bubbling spring</br>Wooed gentle Summer-sleep with its low murmuring.", "But whether that sweet spot was haunted ground,</br>Or that the world-sick fancy loves to stray</br>Thro' regions on our weary Earth unfold,</br>No sooner sleep upon my eyelids lay,</br>Than seemed to light the East a lovelier day;</br>And, lo!  upon the dappled clouds afar</br>Came winged and rose-wreathed forms, that with fond play</br>Danced round and round a slow descending car,</br>From which a radiance shone, richer than Sun or Star.", "And from it stooped upon the flowery bank</br>Three shapes of beauty; yet they wore no plume,</br>In reverend worship at their feet I sank:</br>\"We come,\" said they, and Echo said \"We come,\"</br>In sounds that o'er me hovered like perfume.</br>\"We come, The GRACES three!  to teach the spell,</br>That makes a sweet woman lovelier than her bloom.\"</br>Then rose a heavenly chant of voice and shell:</br>\"Let Wit!  and Wisdom!  with her sovereign beauty dwell!\"</br>"]
