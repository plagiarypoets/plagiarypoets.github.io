["My Jockey is fled from the plain,</br>And left me in sorrow to mourn;</br>Was ever so cruel a swain?</br>Ah, when will the rover return?</br>No longer he pipes on his reed,</br>No longer his praises I'll tell;</br>Yet dull are the banks of the Tweed</br>Since Jockey has bid them farewel.", "His crook he has broken in twain,</br>His sheep and his lambkins now stray;</br>They bleat for their master in vain,</br>And carelessly wander away:</br>Then haste thee some shepherd so free,</br>And call the poor flocks to their home.</br>O!  be to them kinder than he,</br>Who caus'd the dear wand'rers to roam.", "Each virgin so happy and gay,</br>Attend to the words I impart;</br>Be careful and cautious I pray,</br>How you give a young shepherd your heart.</br>Though Jockey was rural and neat,</br>To me was most loving and kind,</br>His manners were gentle and sweet,</br>'Till cruelty grew in his mind.</br>"]
