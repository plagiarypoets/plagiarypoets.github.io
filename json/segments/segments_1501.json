["Hence, vain deluding Joys,</br>The brood of Folly without father bred!</br>How little you bested,</br>Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys!</br>Dwell in some idle brain,</br>And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess,</br>As thick and numberless</br>As the gay motes that people the sun-beams;</br>Or likest hovering dreams,</br>The fickle pensioners of Morpheus' train.</br>But hail, thou goddess, sage and holy,</br>Hail, divinest Melancholy!</br>Whose saintly visage is too bright</br>To hit the sense of human sight,</br>And therefore to our weaker view</br>O'erlaid with black, staid Wisdom's hue;</br>Black, but such as in esteem</br>Prince Memnon's sister might beseem,</br>Or that starr'd Ethiop queen that strove</br>To set her beauty's praise above", "The Sea-Nymphs, and their powers offended:</br>Yet thou art higher far descended:</br>Thee bright-hair'd Vesta, long of yore,</br>To solitary Saturn bore;</br>His daughter she; in Saturn's reign,</br>Such mixture was not held a stain:</br>Oft in glimmering bowers and glades</br>He met her, and in secret shades</br>Of woody Ida's inmost grove,</br>Whilst yet there was no fear of Jove.</br>Come, pensive Nun, devout and pure,</br>Sober, stedfast, and demure,</br>All in a robe of darkest grain,</br>Flowing with majestick train,</br>And sable stole of cyprus lawn,</br>Over thy decent shoulders drawn.</br>Come, but keep thy wonted state,</br>With even step, and musing gait;</br>And looks commercing with the skies,</br>Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes:</br>There held in holy passion still,</br>Forget thyself to marble, till</br>With a sad leaden downward cast</br>Thou fix them on the earth as fast:</br>And join with thee calm Peace, and Quiet,</br>Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet,</br>And hears the Muses in a ring</br>Aye round about Jove's altar sing:</br>And add to these retired Leisure,</br>That in trim gardens takes his pleasure:</br>But first and chiefest with thee bring,</br>Him that yon soars on golden wing,</br>Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne,</br>The Cherub Contemplation;</br>And the mute Silence hist along,</br>'Less Philomel will deign a song,</br>In her sweetest saddest plight,</br>Smoothing the rugged brow of night,</br>While Cynthia checks her dragon yoke,</br>Gently o'er the accustom'd oak:</br>Sweet bird, that shunn'st the noise of folly,</br>Most musical, most melancholy!</br>Thee, chauntress, oft, the woods among,</br>I woo, to hear thy even-song;</br>And, missing thee, I walk unseen</br>On the dry smooth-shaven green,</br>To behold the wandering moon,</br>Riding near her highest noon,</br>Like one that had been led astray</br>Through the heaven's wide pathless way;</br>And oft, as if her head she bow'd,</br>Stooping through a fleecy cloud.</br>Oft, on a plat of rising ground,</br>I hear the far-off Curfeu sound,</br>Over some wide-water'd shore,</br>Swinging slow with sullen roar:</br>Or, if the air will not permit,</br>Some still removed place will fit,</br>Where glowing embers through the room</br>Teach light to counterfeit a gloom;</br>Far from all resort of mirth,</br>Save the cricket on the hearth,</br>Or the belman's drowsy charm,</br>To bless the doors from nightly harm.</br>Or let my lamp at midnight hour,</br>Be seen in some high lonely tower,</br>Where I may oft out-watch the Bear,</br>With thrice-great Hermes, or unsphere</br>The spirit of Plato, to unfold</br>What worlds or what vast regions hold</br>The immortal mind, that hath forsook</br>Her mansion in this fleshly nook:</br>And of those demons that are found</br>In fire, air, flood, or under ground,</br>Whose power hath a true consent</br>With planet, or with element.</br>Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy</br>In scepter'd pall come sweeping by,</br>Presenting Thebes, or Pelops' line,</br>Or the tale of Troy divine,</br>Or what (though rare) of later age</br>Ennobled hath the buskin'd stage.</br>But, O sad Virgin, that thy power</br>Might raise Musaeus from his bower!</br>Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing</br>Such notes, as, warbled to the string,</br>Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek,</br>And made Hell grant what love did seek!</br>Or call up him that left half-told</br>The story of Cambuscan bold,</br>Of Camball, and of Algarsife,</br>And who had Canace to wife,</br>That own'd the virtuous ring and glass;</br>And of the wonderous horse of brass,</br>On which the Tartar king did ride:</br>And if aught else great bards beside</br>In sage and solemn tunes have sung,</br>Of turneys, and of trophies hung,</br>Of forests and enchantments drear,</br>Where more is meant than meets the ear.", "Thus, Night, oft see me in thy pale career,</br>Till civil-suited Morn appear,</br>Not trick'd and frounc'd as she was wont</br>With the Attick boy to hunt,</br>But kercheft in a comely cloud,</br>While rocking winds are piping loud,</br>Or usher'd with a shower still</br>When the gust hath blown his fill,</br>Ending on the russling leaves,</br>With minute drops from off the eaves.</br>And, when the sun begins to fling</br>His flaring beams, me, goddess, bring</br>To arched walks of twilight groves,</br>And shadows brown, that Sylvan loves,</br>Of pine, or monumental oak,</br>Where the rude axe, with heaved stroke,</br>Was never heard the Nymphs to daunt,</br>Or fright them from their hallow'd haunt.</br>There in close covert by some brook,</br>Where no profaner eye may look,</br>Hide me from day's garish eye,</br>While the bee with honied thigh,</br>That at her flowery work doth sing,</br>And the waters murmuring,</br>With such consort as they keep,</br>Entice the dewy-feather'd Sleep;</br>And let some strange mysterious Dream</br>Wave at his wings in aery stream</br>Of lively portraiture display'd,</br>Softly on my eye-lids laid.</br>And, as I wake, sweet musick breathe</br>Above, about, or underneath,</br>Sent by some Spirit to mortals good,</br>Or the unseen Genius of the wood.", "But let my due feet never fail</br>To walk the studious cloysters pale,</br>And love the high-embowed roof,</br>With antick pillars massy proof,</br>And storied windows richly dight,</br>Casting a dim religious light:</br>There let the pealing organ blow,</br>To the full-voic'd quire below,</br>In service high, and anthems clear,</br>As may with sweetness, through mine ear,</br>Dissolve me into ecstasies,</br>And bring all heaven before mine eyes.", "And may at last my weary age</br>Find out the peaceful hermitage,</br>The hairy gown and mossy cell,</br>Where I may sit and rightly spell</br>Of every star that heaven doth shew,</br>And every herb that sips the dew;</br>Till old experience do attain</br>To something like prophetick strain.", "These pleasures, Melancholy, give,</br>And I with thee will choose to live.</br>"]
