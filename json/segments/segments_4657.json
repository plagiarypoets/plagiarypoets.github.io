["Full well I remember the time,</br>When Harriot was pride of my song;</br>For Harriot no longer I rhyme,</br>To another my strains now belong.", "How oft did I load ev'ry gale,</br>As it fled, with the grief of my mind!</br>How oft did I lengthen my tale</br>Of Harriot, as fair as unkind!", "My fond heart says her image is there&mdash;</br>It is &mdash; but she is not the same;</br>Let me cease then to fancy her fair,</br>And loath e'en the sound of her name.", "Henceforth shall resound ev'ry grove</br>With Eliza, the beauteous and young;</br>I'll sing, and my theme shall be love,</br>If Eliza but favour my song.", "Blush!  blush!  thou fair flow'r of the vale,</br>Go hide, thou bright offspring of sun;</br>Ye pinks and carnations, grow pale,</br>For Eliza your charms has out-shone.</br>"]
