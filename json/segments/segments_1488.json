["Come, gentle Peace, companion mild,</br>Of Virtue the immortal child!</br>O hither come!  and bring with thee,</br>Who loves thee well, Philosophy,</br>And let Religion join thy train,</br>And Art and Science, sisters twain,</br>With Meditation, pensive maid,</br>And Silence, daughter of the shade!</br>And now, sweet Peace, O let me dwell</br>With thee, in this secluded cell!</br>Nor Pride, nor Envy, knows this spot,</br>And Malice here pursues me not:</br>But here the Muses still retire,</br>Forgetting not to bring the lyre;</br>And charming thought and care away,</br>Oft cheat me of a summer's day;</br>What time they sing of heroes bold,</br>Whose martial deeds were fam'd of old;</br>What time they dwell in alter'd measures,</br>O Love!  upon thy pains and pleasures.", "'Tis mine to love the gloomy shade,</br>For grief and contemplation made.</br>Oft when the curfeu tells the hour</br>From Gothic pile or antique tow'r,</br>When with the light of closing day</br>The ev'ning landscape fades away,</br>I muse by some romantic stream,</br>Pleas'd by many an idle dream;</br>Or in the fairy-peopled grove,</br>When Fancy sees her phantoms rove,</br>I walk, and meditate alone</br>On gayer hours &mdash; on pleasures gone.", "But if the time my steps invite,</br>I scale yon promontory's height,</br>And there, upon the pointed steep</br>That frowns terrific o'er the deep,</br>I list, while with incessant roar</br>Wave after wave invades the shore;</br>Or watch the moon through ether blue</br>Her solitary course pursue,</br>While clouds, swift passing in their flight,</br>Now hide, and now reveal her light.", "But should the tempest lift its voice,</br>Then is yon cavern drear my choice,</br>Where once, self-punish'd, on the shore</br>A hoary hermit liv'd of yore:</br>There, while disturb'd the eagle shrieks,</br>And the scar'd owl a covert seeks,</br>I mark'd the storm with gather'd force</br>Resistless rush with whirlwind course.</br>In hours like these, in northern isles,</br>Where summer cheers with transient smiles,</br>The hoary-wizard thinks he sees</br>Portents, and signs, and prodigies,</br>And views throughout his realms of snow,</br>Lord of the clime &mdash; the Winter go,</br>Attended by aerial hosts,</br>By warlike troops of restless ghosts,</br>By spectres dire, of hideous form,</br>And demons, riding on the storm.", "Or should its awe-inspiring gloom,</br>Delay my steps at yonder tomb,</br>Where dying tapers dimly burn,</br>And grief still ponders o'er the urn;</br>There, sitting underneath the yew,</br>The sad and solemn scene I view:</br>And while I heave the frequent sigh,</br>A voice thus seems to whisper nigh:</br>\"Ah!  what avails, or youth, or health,</br>The boast of birth, or pride of wealth!</br>Ah!  what is pleasure!  what is pow'r!</br>The dreams that charm us for an hour;</br>What are ye now, who toil'd for fame?</br>Mere dust &mdash; a story &mdash; and a name.\"", "Still when the morn with purple light,</br>Shall chase my slumbers with the night,</br>Let me retire to some green bow'r,</br>Inlaid with many a blooming flow'r,</br>Where sportive Zephyr oft repairs,</br>With odours sweet, and vernal airs;</br>Where Flora and Pomona bring</br>The gifts of autumn and of spring;</br>Where, flying from the solar ray,</br>The nightingale resumes her lay;</br>Where, from the deep parental cave,</br>Unsullied glides the virgin wave:</br>'Tis then, O Muse, at thy command,</br>I seek thy realms of fairy-land!</br>And, as from haunts of men I fly,</br>See all things with a poet's eye.</br>But graver themes delight me more,</br>Than all that wit and fancy store;</br>And oft I meditate the cause</br>Of Nature's works, and Nature's laws&mdash;</br>How Fate has bound the human will&mdash;</br>Whence sorrow sprang &mdash; and why is ill&mdash;</br>How passive matter is combin'd</br>With pure intelligence, and mind&mdash;</br>How things external are perceiv'd&mdash;</br>What should be doubted &mdash; what believ'd.", "And when, at length, my sand has run,</br>Let Death's dread work be quickly done.</br>Let Solitude around my tomb</br>Spread dark her unrelenting gloom,</br>Save when recluses here repair,</br>With lengthen'd rosary and pray'r;</br>Save when poets hither stray,</br>When musing on some mournful lay,</br>And, o'er their sorrows pausing here,</br>With laurels strew a brother's bier.</br>"]
