["Young Peris of the North!  'tis bliss to be</br>Within the influence of these gladdening eyes!</br>More lovely than the lovliest stars to me,</br>And fair as is the light of Eastern skies&mdash;</br>When darkness leaves the world, and daybreak lies</br>Like cradled slumber on wide ocean's face!&mdash;</br>When morning hymns, address'd to Heaven, arise</br>With rising day, that now begins his race</br>On fair Aurora's steeds, all matchless in their pace.", "Ye are the loveliest of the virgin train,</br>That lead the mazy dance, that tread the green;</br>Many's the heart those eyes of yours have slain,</br>Yet all unconscious of their power ye seem!</br>There's not a spot on earth where I have been,</br>Can boast of beauties that more purely shine!</br>Ev'n that famed Paradise of old, I ween,</br>Held naught, in shape of woman, more divine:</br>'Tis well for me, the world hath steel'd this breast of mine!", "And loveliness like this, 'neath northern skies,</br>Such matchless grace, in forms so passing fair,&mdash;</br>Brings more delight into the wondering eyes</br>Than found in climes where the unchilling air</br>Ruffles not nature, nor her children there,</br>Freezes not life, that fills the living vein,</br>Nor presses on the brow that wears no care,</br>But makes more pure the blood that flows again</br>Back to the heart, as streams and rivers seek the main.", "Thy imaged likeness in my soul I'll bear</br>Where lead my steps; and if, in after time,</br>The fame of sculptured groups should meet thine ear,</br>Whose pliant arms around each other twine,</br>Link'd in undying love!  this group divine</br>Will be the Fairy Sisters of my lay;</br>And should they cast one thought on me or mine,</br>'Twill tend to lengthen out my waning day,</br>And lend a brighter gleam to life's last struggling ray.</br>"]
