["Meek nature's child, auspicious maid,</br>With thee to roam the silent glade;</br>Through flow'ry paths of pleasure stray,</br>While balmy health adorns the way,</br>Were better far than tinsell'd toys,</br>Ambition's vain delusive joys;</br>Where envy's venom'd shafts prepare</br>To heap the busy shrine of care,</br>And ruin, and destruction lies</br>Conceal'd beneath the dazzling prize.</br>Oh thou whose soft resistless pow'r</br>Can sooth misfortune's gloomy hour,</br>To whom propitious fates decreed</br>A brighter far, a nobler mead;</br>When morn his purple wreath renews</br>With fragrance moist and pearly dews,</br>Or evening comes in sober grey</br>To Philomela's parting lay,</br>Let me thy solemn accents hear,</br>Soft whisper'd to th' enraptur'd ear,</br>Whether my wand'ring footsteps stray</br>Through groves impervious to the day;</br>Or where the flow'ry fields disclose</br>The varied beauties of the rose;</br>Or by the hill, the stream along,</br>Re-echoing with the shepherd's song.</br>In spring, in summer's ardent rage,</br>Or autumn mellowing into age,</br>Or when collected winter shows</br>A dreary barren waste of snows,</br>Guide me to thy sequester'd cell</br>Wherein the modest virtues dwell;</br>And in thy philosophic train</br>Sweet innocence appears to reign;</br>To live in hope, in pleasure free,</br>And I will yield my heart to thee.</br>"]
