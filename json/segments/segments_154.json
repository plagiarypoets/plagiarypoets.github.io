["WILLY, thy Rhythms so sweetly run and rise,</br>And answer rightly to thy tunefull Reed,</br>That (so mought both our fleecy Cares succeed)</br>I ween (nor is it any vaine Device)</br>That COLLIN dying, his Immortal Muse</br>Into thy Learned Breast did late infuse.", "Thine be his Verse, not his Reward be Thine.</br>Ah me!  That after unbeseeming Care,</br>And secret Want, which bred his last misfare,</br>His Relicks dear obscurely tombed lien</br>Under unwriten Stones, that who goes by</br>Cannot once Read, Lo here doth COLLIN lie.", "Not all the Shepherds of his Calender</br>Yet (Learned Shepherds all, and seen in Song)</br>Theire deepest Layes, and Ditties deep among,</br>More lofty Song did ever make or leer</br>Then this of Thine.  Sing on, thy Task shall be</br>To follow him, while others follow Thee.</br>"]
