["NAIIS, CLAIA, CORBILUS, SATYRE.", "A Satyre on Elizium lights,</br>Whose ugly shape the Nimphes affrights,</br>Yet when they heare his just complaint,</br>They make him an Elizian Saint.", "CORBILUS.</br>What; breathles Nimphs?  bright Virgins let me know</br>What suddaine cause constraines ye to this haste?</br>What have ye seene that should affright ye so?</br>What might it be from which ye flye so fast?</br>I see your faces full of pallid feare,</br>As though some perill followed on your flight;</br>Take breath a while, and quickly let me heare</br>Into what danger ye have lately light.", "NAIIS.</br>Never were poore distressed Gerles so glad,</br>As when kinde, loved Corbilus we saw,</br>When our much haste us so much weakned had,</br>That scarcely we our wearied breathes could draw.", "In this next Grove under an aged Tree,</br>So fell a monster lying there we found,</br>As till this day, our eyes did never see,</br>Nor ever came on the Elizian ground.</br>Halfe man, halfe Goat, he seem'd to us in show,</br>His upper parts our humane shape doth beare,</br>But he's a very perfect Goat below,</br>His crooked Cambrils arm'd with hoofe and hayre.", "CLAIA</br>Through his leane Chops a chattering he doth make</br>Which stirres his staring beastly driveld Beard,</br>And his sharpe hornes he seem'd at us to shake,</br>Canst thou then blame us though we were afeard.", "CORBILUS.</br>Surely it seemes some Satyre this should be,</br>Come and goe back and guide me to the place,</br>Be not affraid, ye are safe enough with me,</br>Silly and harmelesse be their Silvan Race.", "CLAIA</br>How Corbilus; a Satyre doe you say?</br>How should he over high Parnassus hit?</br>Since to these Fields ther's none can finde the way,</br>But onely those the Muses will permit.", "CORBILUS.</br>Tis true; but oft, the sacred Sisters grace</br>The silly Satyre, by whose plainesse, they</br>Are taught the worlds enormities to trace,</br>By beastly mens abhominable way;</br>Besyde he may be banisht his owne home</br>By this base time, or be so much distrest,</br>That he the craggy by-clift Hill hath clome</br>To finde out these more pleasant Fields of rest.", "NAIIS.</br>Yonder he sits, and seemes himselfe to bow</br>At our approch, what doth our presence awe him?</br>Me thinks he seemes not halfe so ugly now,</br>As at the first, when I and Claia saw him.", "CORBILUS.</br>Tis an old Satyre, Nimph, I now discerne,</br>Sadly he sits, as he were sick or lame,</br>His lookes would say, that we may easly learne</br>How, and from whence, he to Elizium came.</br>Satyre, these Fields, how cam'st thou first to finde?</br>What Fate first show'd thee this most happy shore?</br>When never any of thy Silvan kinde</br>Set foot on the Elizian earth before?", "SATYRE.</br>O never aske, how I came to this place,</br>What cannot strong necessity finde out?</br>Rather bemoane my miserable case,</br>Constrain'd to wander the wide world about.</br>With wild Silvanus and his woody crue,</br>In Forrests I, at liberty and free,</br>Liv'd in such pleasure as the world ne'r knew,</br>Nor any rightly can conceive but we.</br>This jocond life we many a day enjoy'd,</br>Till this last age, those beastly men forth brought,</br>That all those great and goodly Woods destroy'd,</br>Whose growth their Grandsyres, with such sufferance sought,</br>That faire Felicia which was but of late,</br>Earth's Paradice, that never had her Peere,</br>Stands now in that most lamentable state,</br>That not a Silvan will inhabit there;</br>Where in the soft and most delicious shade,</br>In heat of Summer we were wont to play,</br>When the long day too short for us we made,</br>The slyding houres so slyly stole away;</br>By Cynthia's light, and on the pleasant Lawne,</br>The wanton Fayry we were wont to chase,</br>Which to the nimble cloven-footed Fawne,</br>Upon the plaine durst boldly bid the base.</br>The sportive Nimphes, with shouts and laughter shooke</br>The Hils and Valleyes in their wanton play,</br>Waking the Ecchoes, their last words that tooke,</br>Till at the last, they lowder were then they.</br>The lofty hie Wood, and the lower spring,</br>Sheltring the Deare, in many a suddaine shower;</br>Where Quires of Birds, oft wonted were to sing,</br>The flaming Furnace wholly doth devoure;</br>Once faire Felicia, but now quite defac'd,</br>Those Braveries gone wherein she did abound,</br>With dainty Groves, when she was highly grac'd</br>With goodly Oake, Ashe, Elme, and Beeches croun'd:</br>But that from heaven their judgement blinded is,</br>In humane Reason it could never be,</br>But that they might have cleerly seene by this,</br>Those plagues their next posterity shall see.</br>The little Infant on the mothers Lap</br>For want of fire shall be so sore distrest,</br>That whilst it drawes the lanke and empty Pap,</br>The tender lips shall freese unto the breast;</br>The quaking Cattle which their Warmstall want,</br>And with bleake winters Northerne winde opprest,</br>Their Browse and Stover waxing thin and scant,</br>The hungry Crowes shall with their Caryon feast.</br>Men wanting Timber wherewith they should build,</br>And not a Forrest in Felicia found,</br>Shall be enforc'd upon the open Field,</br>To dig them Caves for houses in the ground:</br>The Land thus rob'd, of all her rich Attyre,</br>Naked and bare her selfe to heaven doth show,</br>Begging from thence that Jove would dart his fire</br>Upon those wretches that disrob'd her so;</br>This beastly Brood by no meanes may abide</br>The name of their brave Ancestors to heare,</br>By whom their sordid slavery is descry'd,</br>So unlike them as though not theirs they were,</br>Nor yet they sense, nor understanding have,</br>Of those brave Muses that their Country song,</br>But with false Lips ignobly doe deprave</br>The right and honour that to them belong;</br>This cruell kinde thus Viper-like devoure</br>That fruitfull soyle which them too fully fed;</br>The earth doth curse the Age, and every houre</br>Againe, that it these viprous monsters bred.</br>I seeing the plagues that shortly are to come</br>Upon this people cleerely them forsooke:</br>And thus am light into Elizium,</br>To whose straite search I wholly me betooke.", "NAIIS.</br>Poore silly creature, come along with us,</br>Thou shalt be free of the Elizian fields:</br>Be not dismaid, nor inly grieved thus,</br>This place content in all abundance yeelds.</br>We to the cheerefull presence will thee bring,</br>Of Joves deare Daughters, where in shades they sit,</br>Where thou shalt heare those sacred Sisters sing,</br>Most heavenly Hymnes, the strength and life of wit.", "CLAIA</br>Where to the Delphian God upon their Lyres</br>His Priests seeme ravisht in his height of praise:</br>Whilst he is crowning his harmonious Quiers,</br>With circling Garlands of immortall Bayes.", "CORBILUS.</br>Here live in blisse, till thou shalt see those slaves,</br>Who thus set vertue and desert at nought:</br>Some sacrific'd upon their Grandsires graves,</br>And some like beasts in markets sold and bought.</br>Of fooles and madmen leave thou then the care,</br>That have no understanding of their state:</br>For whom high heaven doth so just plagues prepare,</br>That they to pitty shall convert thy hate.</br>And to Elizium be thou welcome then,</br>Untill those base Felicians thou shalt heare,</br>By that vile nation captived againe,</br>That many a glorious age their captives were.</br>"]
