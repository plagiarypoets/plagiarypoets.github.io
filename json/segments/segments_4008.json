["Poet of Nature, hail!  Thy thrilling lay</br>Falls on my heart; and, for a while, subdues</br>The sense of care, that each returning day</br>Wakes me to know.  Led by thy gentle muse,</br>And Fancy's magic aid, once more I stray</br>'Mid fair Devonia's shades, and gaze anew</br>On each enchanting scene, that charm'd my youthful view.", "Belov'd Devonia!  In life's halcyon hours,</br>'Twas mine to wander in thy lovely vales;</br>Where early spring expands her infant flow'rs,</br>And health comes wafted on the tepid gales.</br>And still I love thee, though my feeble pow'rs</br>Fail when I strive to speak that love, or tell</br>How oft, on days gone by, fond mem'ry loves to dwell.", "Haunts of my youth!  hills, dales, and devious streams!</br>Farewell!  perchance for aye. &mdash; For me no more</br>You spread your varied charms &mdash; yet oft in dreams</br>Does wakeful Fancy all those charms restore,</br>Glowing and bright &mdash; as when Sol's orient beams,</br>In Summer morn, illume the eastern sky</br>With the swift-changing tints, that mock the gazer's eye.", "Devonia!  thou canst boast full many a name</br>To art and genius dear &mdash; names that shall live</br>In days remote:  and, lo!  the voice of Fame</br>To Carrington, the deathless meed shall give</br>He breathes a lofty strain, and well may claim</br>To rank with proudest bards, whose verse sublime</br>Shall live, till Nature sinks, subdu'd by conq'ring Time.", "Patrons of Genius!  say, shall care, shall pain,</br>Prey on a heart that feels the sacred glow</br>Of inspiration?  Shall so pure a strain,</br>To taste and virtue true, unheeded flow?</br>No!  be it yours to bid a cheering train</br>Of new-born hopes arise; till, free as air,</br>His buoyant spirit soar above the reach of care.</br>"]
