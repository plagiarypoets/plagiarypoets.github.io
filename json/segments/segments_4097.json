["Edwards, to thee my grateful thanks are due;&mdash;</br>In numbers like thy own I fain would praise</br>Thy kind indulgence to my humble lays:&mdash;</br>By thee encourag'd and instructed too,</br>The lure of poesy I now pursue,</br>But dare not even hope my song to raise</br>Equal to thine, whose every verse conveys</br>Sense, strength, and harmony, and judgment true.</br>But that thy candour, &mdash; modest, &mdash; gentle bard,</br>I know is equal to thy power in song,</br>Or with a muse so weak, so young as mine,</br>I should not on presumptuous wings have dar'd</br>To imitate, with my unhallow'd tongue,</br>Numbers like Spenser's, Milton's, or like thine.</br>"]
