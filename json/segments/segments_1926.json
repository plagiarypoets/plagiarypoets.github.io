["Farewel, aspiring thoughts, no more</br>My soul shall leave the peaceful shore,</br>To sail ambition's main.</br>Fallacious as the harlot's kiss,</br>You promise me uncertain bliss,</br>But give me certain pain.", "A beauteous prospect first you shew,</br>Which, ere survey'd, you paint anew,</br>And paint it wondrous pleasant:</br>This, in a third, is quickly lost,</br>Thus future good we covet most,</br>But ne'er enjoy the present.", "Deluded on, from scene to scene,</br>We never end, but still begin,</br>By flatt'ring hope betray'd;</br>I'm weary of the painful chace,</br>Let others run this endless race,</br>To catch a flying shade.", "Let others boast their useless wealth;</br>Have I not honesty and health?</br>Which riches cannot give:</br>Let others to preferment soar,</br>And, changing liberty for pow'r,</br>In golden shackles live.", "'Tis time at length I should be wise,</br>'Tis time to seek substantial joys,</br>Joys out of fortune's pow'r:</br>Wealth, honours, dignities, and fame</br>Are joys the blind, capricious dame</br>Takes from us ev'ry hour.", "Come, conscious Virtue!  warm my breast,</br>And bring Content, thy daughter, drest</br>In ever-smiling charms:</br>Let sacred Friendship too attend,</br>A friendship worthy of my friend,</br>Such as my LAELIUS warms.", "With these I'll in my bosom make</br>A bulwark Fortune cannot shake,</br>Tho' all her storms arise;</br>Look down and pity gilded slaves,</br>Despise ambition's giddy knaves,</br>And wish the fools were wise.</br>"]
