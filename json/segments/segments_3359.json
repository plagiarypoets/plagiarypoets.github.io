["In a large Forest once there stood</br>A Tree, the Glory of the wood;</br>Call'd, by the neigh'bring Country Folk,</br>With one Consent, the Royal Oak.</br>Oraculous it was, the Fates</br>Of mighty Monarchies, and States,</br>If truly told, and their Debates</br>Of Right, or Wrong, did arbitrate;</br>And if right Reasons would not do't,</br>Found trusty Sticks to beat 'em to't.</br>Not the fam'd Argo, sent from Greece,</br>To Colchos for the Golden Fleece,</br>With richer Spoils return'd again,</br>Than Fleets, built of its Stock, from Spain.</br>Under its Shade the Druids sate</br>Of old; to guide, or ride the State:</br>But Craft, and Cant, by Time explor'd,</br>The Oak obey'd, a rightful Lord,</br>Who soon stripp'd off from Trunk and Bough</br>The Ivy, and the Misleto,</br>Those Suckers, cherisht by blind Zeal</br>To prey upon the Commonweal.</br>But as no State is perfect known,</br>Or permanent below the Sun;</br>The Tree hence various Changes found,</br>Now bark'd and lopt, now trimm'd and prun'd;</br>And by Good fortune, or Disaster,</br>Compell'd full oft' to change its Master.</br>And now, with each Grace endow'd,</br>Just, gen'rous, well-resolv'd, and good,</br>Anxious to do a Woodward's Part,</br>And keep it safe and sound at Heart:</br>But such a Wild about it grew,</br>'Twas more than mortal Man could do</br>To clear the Brakes and Brambles round,</br>That fill'd and tainted all the Ground,</br>The thriving Plants, and Saplings choak'd,</br>And strove to Lord it o'er the Oak,</br>And by their great Increase began</br>T' inflame their native Lebanon.", "May the Reverse of Jotham's Tale</br>Fire from the Oak their Growth destroy;</br>And the Great Warden of the Pale,</br>Axes to clear their Roots imploy.</br>"]
