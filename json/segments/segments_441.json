["Hail, Horrors, hail!  ye ever gloomy bowers,</br>Ye gothic fanes, and antiquated towers,</br>Where rushy Camus' slowly-winding flood</br>Perpetual draws his humid train of mud:</br>Glad I revisit thy neglected reign,</br>Oh take me to thy peaceful shade again.", "But chiefly thee, whose influence breath'd from high</br>Augments the native darkness of the sky;</br>Ah Ignornace!  soft salutary Power!</br>Prostrate with filial reverence I adore.</br>Thrice hath Hyperion roll'd his annual race,</br>Since weeping I forsook thy fond embrace.</br>Oh say, successful do'st thou still oppose</br>Thy leaden Aegis 'gainst our antient foes?</br>Still stretch, tenacious of thy right divine,</br>The massy sceptre o'er thy slumb'ring line?</br>And dews Lethean thro' the land dispense</br>To steep in slumbers each benighted sense?</br>If any spark of Wit's delusive ray</br>Break out, and flash a momentary day,</br>With damp, cold touch forbid it to aspire,</br>And huddle up in fogs the dangerous fire.", "Oh say &mdash; she hears me not, but careless grown,</br>Lethargic nods upon her ebon throne.</br>Goddess!  awake, arise, alas my fears!</br>Can powers immortal feel the force of years?</br>Not thus of old, with ensigns wide unfurl'd,</br>She rode triumphant o'er the vanquish'd world;</br>Fierce nations own'd her unresisted might,</br>And all was Ignorance, and all was night.", "Oh sacred Age!  Oh Times for ever lost!</br>(The School-man's glory, and the Church-man's boast.)</br>For ever gone &mdash; yet still to Fancy new,</br>Her rapid wings the transient scene pursue,</br>And bring the buried ages back to view.", "High on her car, behold the Grandam ride</br>Like old Sesostris with barbaric pride;</br>**** a team of harness'd monarchs bend</br>*****</br>"]
