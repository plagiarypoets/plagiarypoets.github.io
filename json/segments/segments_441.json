["'Twas on a Joyless and a Gloomy Morn,</br>Wet was the Grass, and hung with Pearls the Thorn;</br>When Damon, who design'd to pass the Day</br>With Hounds and Horns, and chase the flying Prey,</br>Rose early from his Bed; but soon he found</br>The Welkin pitch'd with sullen Clouds around,</br>An Eastern Wind, and Dew upon the Ground.</br>Thus while he stood, and sighing did survey</br>The Fields, and curs'd th' ill Omens of the Day,</br>He saw Menalcas come with heavy pace;</br>Wet were his Eyes, and chearless was his Face:</br>He wrung his Hands, distracted with his Care,</br>And sent his Voice before him from afar.</br>Return, he cry'd, return unhappy Swain,</br>The spungy Clouds are fill'd with gath'ring Rain;</br>The Promise of the Day not only cross'd,</br>But ev'n the Spring, the Spring it self is lost.</br>Amyntas, &mdash; Oh!  he cou'd not speak the rest,</br>Nor needed, for presaging Damon guess'd.</br>Equal with Heav'n young Damon lov'd the Boy;</br>The boast of Nature, both his Parents Joy.</br>His graceful Form revolving in his Mind;</br>So great a Genius, and a Soul so kind,</br>Gave sad assurance that his Fears were true;</br>Too well the Envy of the Gods he knew:</br>For when their Gifts too lavishly are plac'd,</br>Soon they repent, and will not make them last.</br>For, sure, it was too bountiful a Dole,</br>The Mother's Features, and the Father's Soul.</br>Thus then he cry'd, The Morn bespoke the News,</br>The Morning did her chearful Light diffuse;</br>But see how suddenly she chang'd her Face,</br>And brought on Clouds and Rains, the Day's disgrace;</br>Just such, Amyntas, was thy promis'd Race!</br>What Charms adorn'd thy Youth where Nature smil'd,</br>And more than Man was giv'n us in a Child.</br>His Infancy was ripe:  a Soul sublime</br>In Years so tender that prevented time:</br>Heav'n gave him all at once; then snatch'd away,</br>E're Mortals all his Beauties cou'd survey.</br>Just like the Flow'r that buds and withers in a day.", "MENALCAS.</br>The Mother Lovely, tho' with Grief opprest,</br>Reclin'd his dying Head upon her Breast.</br>The mournful Family stood all around;</br>One Groan was heard, one Universal Sound:</br>All were in Floods of Tears and endless Sorrow drown'd.</br>So dire a Sadness sate on ev'ry Look,</br>Ev'n Death repented he had giv'n the Stroke.</br>He griev'd his fatal Work had been ordain'd,</br>But promis'd length of Life to those who yet remain'd.</br>The Mother's and her Eldest Daughter's Grace,</br>It seems had brib'd him to prolong their space:</br>The Father bore it with undaunted Soul,</br>Like one who durst his Destiny controul:</br>Yet with becoming Grief he bore his part,</br>Resign'd his Son, but not resign'd his Heart.</br>Patient as Job; and may he live to see,</br>Like him, a now increasing Family:", "DAMON.</br>Such is my Wish, and such my Prophesie.</br>For yet, my Friend, the Beauteous Mold remains,</br>Long may she exercise her fruitful Pains:</br>But, ah!  with better hap, and bring a Race</br>More lasting, and endu'd with equal Grace:</br>Equal she may, but farther none can go;</br>For he was all that was exact below.", "MENALCAS.</br>Damon, behold, yon breaking Purple Cloud;</br>Hear'st thou not Hymns and Songs Divinely loud?</br>There mounts Amyntas, the young Cherubs play</br>About their Godlike Mate, and Sing him on his way.</br>He cleaves the liquid Air, behold he Flies,</br>And every Moment gains upon the Skies;</br>The new come Guest admires th' Aetherial State,</br>The Saphyr Portal, and the Golden Gate;</br>And now admitted in the shining Throng,</br>He shows the Passport which he brought along;</br>His Passport in his Innocence and Grace,</br>Well known to all the Native of the Place.</br>Now Sing yee joyful Angels, and admire</br>Your Brother's Voice that comes to mend your Quire:</br>Sing you, while endless Tears our Eyes bestow;</br>For like Amyntas none is left below.</br>"]
