["Pure as the snowy bosom of the morn,</br>Now may Urania all her graces bend;</br>First, let Benevolence the hours adorn,</br>And Charity o'er all her mantle wend,</br>Ah!  let not aught refrain the fost'ring friend!</br>Ill would it suit when Riot roams around,</br>O'erpaid with blessing on this festive day,</br>That e'en Misfortune cheerless should be found,</br>Or Worth excluded from the glad scenes stray,</br>Where Heav'n has smil'd on man with warm benignant ray.", "And come, Philanthropy!  devoid of gall,</br>Who like the sun a constant smile supplies;</br>Now may Contraction shrink from off the ball,</br>Smit with the milder radiance of thine eyes,</br>Maugre the groveling Bigot's bursting sighs:</br>Nor let th' unthinking mock thy god-like power,</br>Who never knew the thrilling joy to bless;</br>Who never check'd the swoln eye-burning show'r,</br>Nor hush'd the wild waves of acute distress;</br>Nor gave a tongue to Heav'n its grateful aid to bless.", "The, tho' the wintry waste should heap around,</br>And Nature's gay variety destroy,</br>Each cheerful trace in icy sheen confound,</br>The mind's bright orb shall know no damp alloy;</br>Nor time nor age exhaust the source of joy!</br>But like th' Equatorial clime shall bring</br>Perennial blossoms to adorn the year;</br>And oft to Happiness renew the spring,</br>More richly redolent, serenely clear,</br>To fame-recording song and every virtue dear.</br>"]
