["What dreary prospects meets the eye,</br>How dismal howls the western wind,</br>What storms deface the azure sky,</br>And ah!  what terrors seize the mind.</br>Say, to illume this gloomy scene,</br>Will no kind power its aid impart?</br>Yes, Hope, she comes sweet soothing queen:</br>See through the shades her radiance dart,</br>And pours a balsam on the drooping heart.", "She in smiling future shows</br>Vernal meads and valleys gay,</br>Where the modest violet blows,</br>And laughing Nature gives the May,</br>And Summer's blythsome dewy eve,</br>When careless to the grove we stray,</br>Where jas'mines, woodbines, interweave,</br>While Eglantine syringas gay,</br>And fragrance-breathing roses strew the way.", "Sweet Hope, whose magic o'er the soul,</br>Alike the king and peasant find,</br>All join to bless thy soft controul,</br>Thou first best friend of human kind;</br>Chas'd by thy smiles flies Care and Pain,</br>And pining Love and black Despair,</br>The rosy cherubs of thy train</br>Are Pleasure, Joy, and Fancy fair,</br>And jocund Mirth, sweet antidote to Care.", "I woo the goddess to my heart,</br>Oh deign to be a constant guest,</br>Thy gentle soothing smiles impart,</br>Throw by the light fantastic dress,</br>Thy glowing tints shall paint each scene</br>That on life's toilsome stage appears,</br>Thy magic glass shall intervene,</br>And shield me from low thoughted cares,</br>Till all my days, my hours, thy livery wears.</br>"]
