["Thou bidst!  \"my purple slumbers fly!\"</br>Day's radiance pours upon my eye.</br>I wake &mdash; I live!  the sense o'erpays</br>The trivial griefs of early days.</br>What!  tho' the rose-bud on my cheek</br>Spoke youth, and joy &mdash; and careless thought,</br>By guilt, or fear, or shame un-smote:</br>My \"blooming\" soul is yet in youth,</br>Its lively sense attests the truth.", "O!  I can wander yet, and taste</br>The beauties of the flow'ry waste;</br>The Nightingale's deep swell can feel,</br>Whilst from my lids the soft drops steal;</br>Rapt!  gaze upon the gem-deck'd night,</br>And mark the clear moon's silent flight;</br>Whilst the slow river's crumpl'd wave</br>Repeats the quiv'ring beams she gave.", "Nor yet, the pencil strives in vain,</br>To wake upon the canvas plain,</br>All the strong passions of the mind,</br>Or hint the sentiment refin'd;</br>To its sweet magic yet I bow,</br>As when Youth deck'd my polish'd brow.</br>The chissel's feath'ry touch to trace,</br>Thro' the nerv'd form, or soften'd grace,</br>Is lent me still.  Still I admire,</br>And kindle at the Poet's fire&mdash;</br>My torch, at Della Crusca's light,</br>And distant follow his superior flight.", "O Time!  since these are left me still,</br>Of lesser thefts e'en take thy fill:</br>Yes, steal the lustre from my eye,</br>And bid the soft Carnation fly;</br>My tresses sprinkle with thy snow,</br>Which boasted once the auburn glow,</br>Warp the slim form that was ador'd</br>By him, so lov'd, my bosom'd LORD&mdash;</br>But leave me, when all these you steal,</br>The mind to taste, the nerve to feel!</br>"]
