["O Goddess of the gloomy scene,</br>Of shadowy shapes thou black-brow'd queen;</br>Thy tresses dark with ivy crown'd,</br>On yonder mould'ring abbey found;</br>Oft wont from charnels damp and dim,</br>To call the sheeted spectre grim,</br>While, as his loose chains loudly clink,</br>Thou add'st a length to ev'ry link:</br>O thou, that lov'st at eve to seek</br>The pensive pacing pilgrim meek,</br>And sett'st before his shudd'ring eyes</br>Strange forms, and fiends of giant-size,</br>As wildly works thy wizard will,</br>Till fear-struck fancy has her fill:</br>Dark pow'r, whose magic might prevails</br>O'er hermit-rocks, and fairy-vales;</br>O goddess, erst, by SPENSER view'd,</br>What time th' enchanter vile embru'd</br>His hands in FLORIMEL'S pure heart,</br>Till loos'd by steel clad BRITOMART:</br>O thou that erst, on fancy's wing,</br>Didst terror-trembling TASSO bring</br>To groves where kept damn'd furies dire</br>Their blazing battlements of fire:</br>Thou that through many a darksome pine</br>O'er the rugged rock recline,</br>Didst wake the hollow-whisp'ring breeze</br>With care-consumed ELOISE:</br>O thou with whom, in cheerless cell,</br>The midnight clock pale pris'ners tell;</br>O haste thee, mild Miltonic maid,</br>From yonder yew's sequestered shade;</br>More bright than all the fabled Nine,</br>Teach me to breathe the solemn line!</br>O bid my well-ranged numbers rise</br>Pervious to none but Attic eyes;</br>O give the strain that madness moves,</br>Till every starting sense approves!", "What felt the Gallic traveller,</br>When far in Arab-desert drear,</br>He found within the catacomb,</br>Alive, the terrors of a tomb?</br>While many a mummy, through the shade,</br>In hieroglyphic stole array'd,</br>Seem'd to uprear the mystic head,</br>And trace the gloom with ghostly tread;</br>Thou heardst him pour the stifled groan,</br>HORROR!  his soul was all thy own!", "O mother of the fire-clad thought,</br>O haste thee from thy grave-like grot!</br>(What time the witch perform'd her rite,)</br>Sprung from th' embrace of TASTE and Night</br>O queen!  that erst did thinly spread</br>The willowy leaves o'er ISIS' head,</br>And to her meek mien didst dispense</br>Woe's most awful negligence;</br>What time, in cave, with visage pale,</br>She told her elegiac tale:</br>O thou!  whom wand'ring WARTON saw,</br>Amaz'd with more than youthful awe,</br>As, by the pale moon's glimmering gleam,</br>He mus'd his melancholy theme:</br>O curfeu-loving goddess haste!</br>O waft me, to some SCYTHIAN waste,</br>Where, in Gothic solitude,</br>Mid prospects most sublimely rude,</br>Beneath a rough rock's gloomy chasm,</br>Thy sister sits, ENTHUSIASM:</br>Let me with her, in magic trance,</br>Hold most delirious dalliance;</br>Till I, thy pensive votary,</br>HORROR, look madly-wild like thee;</br>Until I gain true transport's shore,</br>And life's retiring scene is o'er,</br>Aspire to some more azure sky,</br>Remote from dim mortality;</br>At length, recline the fainting head,</br>In Druid-dreams dissolv'd and dead!</br>"]
