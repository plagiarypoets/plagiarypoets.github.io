["So oft as I the Splendour do behold</br>Of heav'nly Graces, linkt in golden chaine,</br>Which them so firmely doth together hold,</br>That all they but as one seeme to remaine;</br>My Soule is so delighted with their traine,</br>That she desires to dwell with them for ay;</br>But oft employment, pleasures, cares and gaine,</br>Mine eyes and heart so draw another way,</br>I fleshly motions more than spirituall obay.", "And as these Graces joyn'd, my soule delight,</br>So doth each singled out by Meditation,</br>Sing I of Love, I love with all my might:</br>If Humblenesse, she workes humiliation:</br>So Faith, Repentance, Hope, Justification,</br>By Righteousnesse imputed:  Mercy kind,</br>Joy, Patience, Fortitude, chast Conversation,</br>Peace, Meeknesse, Prayer, Zeale, ev'n all I find</br>Do alwayes to my Song, both sute mine heart and mind.", "But such are my Corruptions innate,</br>Hels malice, and the worlds enticements vaine,</br>I can no longer hold that happy state,</br>Than I in Contemplation remaine:</br>This is the cause my Muse is now so faine</br>To sing of Constancie, that heav'nly Grace,</br>Which all the rest doth ay with us retaine</br>Most glorious Grace!  the lustre of whose face,</br>Both heav'nly Love, and all her Peeres for ever grace.", "For, without Her, the rest are all but showes,</br>Like Corne by high-wayes side, flourish awhile,</br>And seemes more glorious, than that which grows</br>Upon best bottom'd, dunged, tilled Soyle:</br>But as that onely doth our eyes beguile</br>With flourishes, in calme and gentle spring,</br>But Summers heate, and frosts, it's verdure spoile:</br>Ev'n so, these rootlesse Vertues flourishing,</br>Adverse or prosp'rous Fortune to confusion bring.", "Thou, that art from Eternity the same,</br>Without least shadow of Variety:</br>Like to the Sun, heav'ns pure world-lightning flame,</br>Constant in beate, course, and serenitie:</br>Three, yet subsisting in one Deitie,</br>Who, though thou seem'st to change with things below,</br>Art farre in truth from Mutability:</br>Oh make mine heart in vertue constant grow,</br>That thence, as from a Fountaine, this Discourse may flow.", "We Constancie a Perseverance call</br>In some good purpose:  for in ev'ry thing</br>We undertake, right must be first of all</br>Resolv'd of, next, our firme persevering:</br>A vaine, unsettled, idle wavering</br>Without just ground, by Proteus, Poets faine,</br>Who on himselfe as many formes will bring,</br>As he hath idle notions in his braine,</br>Or base desires and Lusts which in his heart remaine.", "But in good purpose to stand fast and sound,</br>Not onely man-like is, but most divine,</br>Like God, in whom no change was ever found:</br>For as the Sunne, this worlds pure crystall eyne,</br>In heav'n doth alwaies with like glory shine,</br>Though, by the varying Medium's here below,</br>It seeme more glorious in the Summer time,</br>Than when Eolian blasts darke clouds

undergoes:</br>For without Suffering's no Patience:</br>But Constance is in joy and paine a firme defence.", "Without Compulsion, free for Vertues sake,</br>Patience constrain'd, oft by necessity,</br>Most cheerefull valiantly doth undertake</br>To beare, what cannot well avoyded be:</br>One good end Constancie propounds, which she</br>Onely regards:  but noble patience,</br>Before her will all evils conquerd see,</br>Which her oppresse in flesh or conscience:</br>Both have brave resolution, and sound confidence.", "No fury of the headlesse Multitude,</br>No Tyrants rage a constant mind can shake;</br>Though all the world turne to a Chaos rude,</br>The ruines crush him may, but can not make</br>Him stagger, nor Joves thunder make him quake.</br>The Sea may roare, the waves mount to the skies,</br>And threaten him to drowne in deepest Lake:</br>But Fury, Rage, Waves, all he doth despise,</br>And when hopes outward faile, his inward highest rise.", "He constant perseveres unto the end,</br>Like some good traveller, who gives not in,</br>Till he attaine the place he doth intend:</br>And as the Souldier, that the towne would winne,</br>Fights stoutly, till he conquers all within:</br>Ev'n so in Buildings, Arts, or Merchandize,</br>In any Worke or Science we beginne,</br>It is the end where all our glory lyes;</br>He runs in vaine, that faints before he

perswasions;</br>They it defend from all faint-hearted base invasions.", "A constant man, the most disastrous fate,</br>With a most pleasing forehead entertaines:</br>Integrity so sweetens his estate,</br>As in a pleasant Calme he ay remaines:</br>With her he alwayes in his heart retaines,</br>Hope, Prudence, Fortitude, Right, Temperance:</br>And when him Troubles, Losses, Griefe or Paines</br>Assaile, so stoutly patience doth advance,</br>He liveth most secure, not subject unto Chance.", "Brave noble Constance!  who art never sound,</br>Except dame Prudence thee accompany,</br>Thou on her counsels and advice dost found</br>Thy setled resolutions all, whereby</br>Thou standst most firme for Truth and Honesty;</br>Nothing can thee, thus well resolv'd, withstand.</br>In vaine and evill things no constancie,</br>But base perversnesse, we do understand;</br>Just, honest, profitable's all she takes in hand.", "For perseverance in a thing that's ill,</br>Is to this Vertue no lesse enemy,</br>Than they that by affections guide their will,</br>With vaine inconstancy and levitie:</br>Who, of a wanton imbecillity,</br>Stagger and change at ev'ry

Lo, such a one,</br>Appeares like Cato's Ape, wondrous severe,</br>With rugged brow; but you may find him soone</br>Dissolv'd in Laughter, or ev'n dead with feare:</br>Such, any publike Office is unfit to beare.", "No truth of Judgement or Sinceritie,</br>In such a vaine inconstant mind is found:</br>But Slouth, Fraud, Wantonnesse, Iniquity,</br>With all the basest Vices there abound:</br>This Levity in youth doth age confound</br>With doting madnesse; and a man declares</br>Wise onely then in shew, not inward sound:</br>But then a brave and constant mind appeares,</br>When constant Resolution honours silver haires.", "Well said th' old Cynicke, when him friends advise</br>To leave his study, and to take his rest:</br>I am, saith he, now running for a prize,</br>And therefore in the end must run my best.</br>The shorter time of Life to us doth rest,</br>More constantly we to our ayme must rend.</br>Who runs, saith Paul, the race, is never blest</br>With due reward, that holds

resolutions sound,</br>As they unmov'd, so without alteration</br>Are good Conclusions built on Vertues ground:</br>A constant man stands on a rocke profound,</br>Which neither stormes, wind, waves,

whence</br>All other Graces have their Consummation:</br>To her is giv'n, or rather she gives man salvation.", "What more like unto God than Constancie?</br>Who ay like Sunne in heav'n remaines the same,</br>Though to descend to mans capacity,</br>He often seeme to change his mind and name.</br>The Scriptures then mans changing closely blame,</br>When they affirme, God grieves, or doth repent:</br>'Tis flesh that alters, God is still the same:</br>So clouds seeme oft to change the Firmament,</br>Which till the Day of Doome stands firme and permanent.", "When as she hath a constat of the right,</br>She therein perseveres unto the end:</br>Therefore of constat she is Constance hight;</br>And well this name her nature doth commend.</br>Her understanding first doth apprehend</br>Things to be good, before she doth beginne:</br>Then she most constantly doth ay intend,</br>When she consid'rately hath entred in:</br>Thus all the Saints on earth, a roome in heav'n must win.", "And though all flesh, by our first Parents fall,</br>Are so unconstant, vaine, and wavering,</br>They have in words, thoughts, actions, and all,</br>Of Eves fond ficklenesse a

destroyeth all;</br>No force, nor fury can his constant mind appall.", "I number may the Starres of heav'n as well,</br>As here the Mirrors all of Constance count,</br>Who champions brave against world, flesh, and hell,</br>In Fortitude and Patience surmount:</br>Many of them I formerly recount,</br>In Fortitudes and Patience Meditation,</br>They all arise from one faire heav'nly
