["War!  Nature-shocking, hideous form;</br>Far grimmer than the Wintry storm!</br>Thy voice, like fellest Monster's howl,</br>Harsh &mdash; harrows the recoiling soul;</br>Th' unnat'ral passions cannot rest,</br>Which crowd thy admantine breast,</br>&mdash;That breast, which Pity's pow'r ne'er felt,</br>Where soft'ning tenderness ne'er dwelt;</br>Dire Vengeance frowns upon thy brow,</br>And brooding Anger's redd'ning glow;</br>Thy baleful eyes with madness stare,</br>And equal the red lightning's glare;</br>A blood-stain'd robe, around thee seen,</br>Augments the horrors of thy mien;</br>Death, Pain, and Torture form thy train:</br>And, to increase the dismal scene,</br>Loud cries and groans the ear assail,</br>The Widow's moan, and Orphan's wail:</br>Lank Famine too, and all the woes</br>Which utmost Misery compose,</br>With Desolation mark the way,</br>Where'er thy dreadful footsteps stray.</br>All Nature shrinks before thy face;</br>Its ev'ry beauty, ev'ry grace,</br>And all its blooming glories fade,</br>And gloom and dreariness succeed.</br>Ah!  curse and pest of human race!</br>May Heav'n avert thy rueful face</br>And hateful looks from BRITAIN'S Isle:</br>May she with wealth and grandeur smile;</br>May Commerce float around her shore,</br>And not the cannon's death-fraught roar;</br>Then will her SONS, with cheerful voice,</br>And hearts dilated, glad rejoice,</br>'Cause Peace extends her Olive Wand,</br>And scatters Plenty o'er the Land.</br>"]
