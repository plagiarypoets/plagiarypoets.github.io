["But thou, enchantress-queen!  whose love hath made</br>His desolation &mdash; thou art by his side,</br>In all thy sovereignty of charms array'd,</br>To meet the storm with still unconquer'd pride.</br>Imperial being!  e'en though many a stain</br>Of error be upon thee, there is power</br>In thy commanding nature, which shall reign</br>O'er the stern genius of misfortune's hour;</br>And the dark beauty of thy troubled eye</br>E'en now is all illumined with wild sublimity.", "Thine aspect, all impassion'd, wears a light</br>Inspiring and inspired &mdash; thy cheek a die,</br>Which rises not from joy, but yet is bright</br>With the deep glow of feverish energy,</br>Proud siren of the Nile!  thy glance is fraught</br>With an immortal fire &mdash; in every beam</br>It darts, there kindles some heroic thought,</br>But wild and awful as a sybil's dream;</br>For thou with death hast communed, to attain</br>Dread knowledge of the pangs that ransom from the chain.", "And the stern courage by such musings lent</br>Daughter of Afric!  o'er thy beauties throws</br>The grandeur of a regal spirit, blent</br>With all the majesty of mighty woes!</br>While he, so fondly, fatally adored,</br>Thy fallen Roman, gazes on thee yet,</br>Till scarce the soul, that once exulting soar'd,</br>Can deem the day-star of its glory set;</br>Scarce his charm'd heat believes that power can be</br>In sovereign fate, o'er him, thus fondly loved by thee.</br>"]
