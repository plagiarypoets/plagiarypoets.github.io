["Where now is that sun of repose,</br>That once used to smile on this Breast,</br>On the Morn that so genially rose,</br>And at eve set so kindly in rest?", "Alas!  all withdrawn from my sight,</br>On the Morning no longer it beams;</br>And, instead of contentment at night,</br>Spreads horror alone in my dreams.", "O Belmour!  why e'er did I hear</br>What I knew must be death to believe?</br>Or drink up a strain with my ear,</br>When I saw it was meant to deceive?", "To whom, tell me now, can I speak,</br>That will not reproach and exclaim?</br>And read through the blush on this cheek,</br>That guilt is the parent of shame?", "In vain the dark grove do I try,</br>Some respite from censure to find;</br>But, Oh!  from a world I may fly,</br>Yet cannot escape from my mind!", "In the thickest recess of the shade,</br>My conscience cries, \"Flavia, see there,</br>What a wretch a fond father is made,</br>What a mother is plung'd in despair.\"", "The Zephyr's most innocent gale</br>Now seems at my conduct to roar;</br>And the stream, as it winds through the dale,</br>Says, \"Flavia is spotless no more.\"", "At church, in the moment of pray'r,</br>Remorse lifts her terrible rod,</br>And harrows my soul with despair,</br>Though I kneel at the throne of my God.", "'Tis just; &mdash; and I cannot upbraid,</br>For Belmour yet swells in my eye;</br>And this bosom, though basely betray'd,</br>Still heaves with too tender a sigh!", "In spite of religion's pure breath,</br>The softest ideas will rise;</br>And I doat to distraction and death,</br>While I labour to hate and despise.", "Come, grave, then, thou best of reliefs,</br>Regardless of season or time,</br>At once give an End to my griefs,</br>And a Lethe to wash o'er my crime.", "Yet cease not, ye tears, still to flow</br>From the fount of contrition or love;</br>So th' excess of my sorrows below</br>May purchase my pardon above.</br>"]
