["When welcome rain the weary reapers drove</br>Beneath the shelter of a neighbouring grove,</br>Robin, a love-sick swain, lagg'd far behind,</br>Nor seem'd the weight of falling showers to mind;</br>A distant solitary shade he sought,</br>And thus disclos'd the troubles of his thought.", "Yes, yes, these drops may cool my outward heat,</br>These breezes fresh assuage the boiling sweat,</br>But my hot blood, my heart that's all in flame,</br>Nor drops can cool, nor breezes fresh can tame.", "Here, here it was in this unlucky place,</br>Where first I got a sight of Betty's face;</br>Blyth on this path the charmer tripp'd, and near</br>We strew'd the golden product of the year:</br>Heedless I glanc'd, nor could my eyes command,</br>Till the rough sickle gash'd into my hand;</br>Down pour'd the blood, the reapers all burst out,</br>In peals of laughter; Betty look'd about;</br>Red grew my fingers, redder far my face:</br>What could I do in such a desperate case?", "Away I slunk, to Gammar made my moan,</br>My Gammar (God be with her now she's gone)</br>Skillful the gushing blood with cobwebs staid,</br>Then on the wound an healing plaister laid;</br>The healing plaister ceas'd the painful sore,</br>The fear indeed remains, but nothing more.", "Not so that other wound, that inward smart,</br>My Gammar could not cure a bleeding heart;</br>I've borne the bitter torment this long year,</br>And all my life-time must be forc'd to bear,</br>Lest Betty will a kind physician prove,</br>For none but she has skill to medicine love.", "But how should honest Betty give relief?</br>Betty's a perfect stranger to my grief:</br>Oft I've resolv'd my ailment to explain;</br>Oft I've resolv'd indeed &mdash; but all in vain:</br>A springing blush, spread fast o'er either cheek,</br>Down Robin look'd, and deuce a word could speak.", "Can I forget that night?  (I never can)</br>When on the clean-swept hearth the spindles ran?</br>The lasses drew their line with busy speed,</br>The lads as busy minded every thread,</br>When sad!  the line so slender Betty drew,</br>Snap went the thread, and down the spindle flew:</br>To me it made, &mdash; they ey'd with watchful view,</br>I must, must take it up; what could I do?</br>I took it, and (what goes plaguy hard)</br>E'en reach'd it back without the sweet reward.", "O lasting stain!  it's easy yet to trace</br>A guilty conscience in my blushing face;</br>I fain would wash it out, but never can;</br>Still fair it bides, like blood of murder'd man.", "Not so was Willy bashful &mdash; Willy spy'd</br>A pair of scissars by the lass's side;</br>These slily loos'd, he drop'd the spindle down&mdash;</br>And what said Betty?  Betty strove to frown:</br>Up flew her hand to strike the crouching swain,</br>But ah!  it fell but lightly down again;</br>What follow'd next, it galls me to repeat,</br>E'en now I feel my heart with envy beat.", "Oh!  well is he that ever he was born,</br>He's free from all this mockery and scorn,</br>What, must I still be teaz'd with straggling sheep,</br>With far-fetch'd sighs, and things I said asleep;</br>Still shamefully left trifling in the rear,</br>Jest of each swain, and ev'ry reaper's jeer?", "Where's now that active strength, (ah hapless love!)</br>Which erst I shew'd when we for victory strove;</br>When thro' the standing corn a lane I made,</br>And bustling far behind the rest survey'd?", "Alas!  that strength is gone, and comes no more,</br>Till Betty's kindness shall the loss restore;</br>And vain the hope that e'er she should be kind,</br>Till I have freely spoken out my mind,</br>Till I have learn'd to face the maiden fair,</br>Oil'd my slow tongue, and edg'd my sheepish air.", "A book there is &mdash; but I forget the name&mdash;</br>Something of Compliments, I think, &mdash; the same,&mdash;</br>Which to a clever spark can change a clown;</br>Oh!  had I this, my business would be done;</br>And I'm resolv'd to buy, whate'er it cost;</br>My flute, &mdash; for what's my flute if Betty's lost?</br>And if I clasp the fair one in my arms,</br>A fig for whistles and for music's charms.", "Farewel my flute then, quick the Carlisle fair,</br>There to the book-shop I will straight repair,</br>And boldly for the Compliments enquire;</br>Care I a farthing?  let the 'prentice sneer.", "That done, a handsome letter I'll indite,</br>Handsome as ever country lad did write;</br>A letter that shall tell her all I feel,</br>And every wish without a blush reveal.", "But now the breaking clouds disperse away,</br>And the clear sun emits a chearful ray,</br>Brave hearty blasts the drooping barley dry;</br>The rest are gone to reap, &mdash; and so must I.</br>"]
