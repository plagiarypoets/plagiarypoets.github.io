["Yes, she was beauteous!  and, a beaming light,</br>Mild, and yet bright, across her temples play'd,</br>Like the soft blush of twilight, ere the night</br>Hath cast around her melancholy shade.</br>She was, in sooth, perfection's dearest maid;</br>One, in whose eye, e'en Virtue might discern</br>Her lovely self reflected and display'd;</br>Whose fore-head was a book, where Guilt might learn</br>How blest that innocence, from which he'd dar'd to turn.", "So freely hung the ringlets of her hair,</br>That it did seem uncertain, if design</br>Or Nature's self had plac'd them as they were;</br>And o'er her bosom they did brightly shine,</br>Like angels guarding Virtue's sainted shrine.</br>There was a sweet expression round her brow,</br>Which conquer'd hearts &mdash; at least it conquer'd mine;</br>And I, who laugh'd at Cupid's pow'r, must now</br>Borrow his softest sigh, and breathe his tend'rest vow.", "Oh!  I have stood to gaze upon her eye,</br>Until my soul seem'd parting with that gaze;</br>For, it was blue and beauteous as the sky,</br>When not a shadow o'er its surface strays;</br>And it cast forth such melancholy rays</br>Of soft and secret passion, that I cried,</br>\"How sweetly, one expressive glance repays</br>Whole years of cold indifference and pride,</br>And all the doubts and fears which are to love allied!\"</br>"]
