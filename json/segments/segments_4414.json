["Yes, Shepherds!  swell the strain, and weave the dance</br>In cheerful circles down your echoing vales&mdash;</br>Then, bounding like the Alpine deer, advance</br>With streamers gaily deck'd with pictur'd tales;</br>Ye maidens, poising well your rich hung pails,</br>Mothers, with infants smiling like the morn,</br>All, all advance &mdash; an airy herald sails</br>With the swift tidings that a Prince is born&mdash;</br>Shout the last shout of joy, and to your shades return.", "Yes, shout! &mdash; that peal of gladness is your last!</br>Wave high your trophies, and your off'rings spread!</br>Now be ye dumb!  and on the ocean cast</br>Your heart's oblation &mdash; for your Prince is dead!</br>Dead e'er he lived!  for by his mother's bed,</br>Mocking the nurse's care, the leech's skill,</br>Stood iron-hearted fate, and scowling fled</br>With his scarce kindled spirit &mdash; \"Just heaven, thy will,\"</br>The lovely mother sigh'd, \"be done!  poor heart, lie still.\"</br>"]
