["Now Spring, of seasons gentle queen,</br>In flow'ry mantle rob'd of green;</br>Her locks in beauteous ringlets spread,</br>And rainbows circling round her head;</br>From southern climes, which shar'd erewhile</br>The vital sunshine of her smile;</br>Upon a sun-beam gilded cloud,</br>While grateful nature shouts aloud,</br>Approaches; led by jocund Mirth,</br>To give ten thousand objects birth;</br>Sparkling her eye, her aspect sweet,</br>All nature pure beneath her feet;</br>Approaches, to alight anon,</br>Winter with all his tempest gone;</br>To bid the month divided year</br>Begin its downy wing'd career.</br>Awake the reed, the dance awake,</br>And call creation to partake,</br>While various tasks and scenes employ,</br>Of universal wealth and joy.", "The virgin-choir of Graces bland,</br>Each with a rose-bud in her hand,</br>With dimpled cheeks in vermeil dy'd,</br>Attend their queen on either side.</br>Around her sportive Cupids dance,</br>Bending their bows with wanton glance,</br>With various signs and various arts,</br>Soon to surprise a thousand hearts.</br>Plump buxom Plenty, pleas'd Content,</br>And Peace, on gentlest errand sent;</br>Gay social Ease, and Friendship kind,</br>Make up her smiling train behind:</br>While Music with her warbling lute,</br>All in attentive silence mute.</br>Thro' air in undulations toss'd,</br>With gradual cadence gently lost,</br>Swells the impassion'd note before,</br>Sweetly repeated o'er and o'er.</br>Hov'ring aloft in liquid sky,</br>She views the earth with anxious eye,</br>To see thro' all its wide extent,</br>What change each place has underwent;</br>Where Winter's triumphs most appear,</br>To blast the sun-abondon'd year,</br>(Rude tyrant thron'd on hills of snow),</br>There most her favours to bestow.</br>She views, and thro' the blue expanse</br>Bids the bright lord of day advance;</br>Bids Winter's gloom, the sky that shrouds,</br>Quick vanish into fleecy clouds;</br>Commands the snows to fall no more,</br>And colds to give their freezings o'er;</br>Restrains the torrents of the sky,</br>Soft dews their fury to supply;</br>Forbids the angry storm to rage,</br>While lawless elements engage,</br>But, hush'd to silence by degrees,</br>To imitate the fanning breeze.</br>Thus all her mild commands express'd,</br>To her arrival left the rest;</br>Strait from a lucid cloud that bends,</br>She with her jovial court descends;</br>While Zephyr breathes around, and flings</br>Ambrosial odours from her wings.</br>Some of her light etherial train</br>Frequent the lilly broider'd plain,</br>Pleas'd to survey on ev'ry side</br>The variegated prospect wide.</br>Some to the hill's aerial height</br>To bend their upward steps delight,</br>And there, no vapours foul to wreathe,</br>In elemental pureness breathe.</br>Some to the river's shady banks,</br>Where wild goats wanton o'er their pranks,</br>When noon-tide heats infest the air,</br>With fond alacrity repair.</br>Others, amid the grove's lone walk,</br>With fancied forms affect to talk;</br>Echoes, that deep in caves reside,</br>And Zephyrs that in whispers glide:</br>While numbers in the osier shade,</br>For tender scenes of rapture made,</br>Attune to love the sylvan reed,</br>And chide each moment's forward speed.", "Where-e'er the blushing goddess moves,</br>Her smile, her touch, creative proves.</br>Beneath the splendour of her eyes</br>New infant-forms of beauty rise.</br>Nature all life and transport seems,</br>And earth with births impatient teems.</br>The woods in waving foliage clad,</br>The fields with checquer'd carpets spread;</br>The brook late swell'd from melting hills,</br>Gliding along in silver rills;</br>The meadows stock'd with flocks and herds,</br>The copses throng'd with warbling birds:</br>Shepherds and nymphs, in parties met,</br>With rosy cheeks and eyes of jet;</br>In social strains prepar'd to sing</br>The charms of Nature and of Spring,</br>With hearts elate and looks serene,</br>Beyond what raptur'd poets feign.", "Now from the city's noisy streets,</br>Where Care with Grandeur ever meets,</br>The winter-prison'd croud repair,</br>With Spring soft rural scenes to share;</br>Amply to gain, in rosy health,</br>What they had forfeited for wealth.</br>Such hapless man's peculiar fate,</br>Nor rich alike in all, nor great!</br>If in one article he thrives,</br>And one alone, howe'er he strives,</br>In others, for so Heav'n decrees,</br>His sudden ill-success he sees!</br>Nor blame the justice of the skies;</br>One falls, and hence a thousand rise.</br>Nought but the partial love of gain</br>Could them in noise and smoke detain;</br>Save Spring's glad call no fond pretence</br>Could court their loit'ring footsteps hence.", "But, more supremely charm'd than those,</br>Julia the fair enamour'd goes</br>The ever-lovely dame to meet,</br>With brow as mild and aspect sweet;</br>Breath that partakes of her perfume,</br>And cheek that emulates her bloom;</br>By the green margin of a stream,</br>That sparkles to the pointed beam;</br>Beneath some ag'd romantic oak,</br>Where thoughtful bards the muse invoke;</br>Up some fair eminence, from whence</br>The landscape is survey'd immense;</br>In some close copse, or woodbine shade,</br>Or o'er some lawn, or upland glade;</br>Some level vista's measur'd walk,</br>Or deep recess where echoes talk;</br>Where wakeful Philomele complains,</br>And linnets warble forth their strains;</br>Where airy Fancy strays alone</br>In calm retirements of her own,</br>And, though apart from human kind,</br>Can company and converse find.</br>Nor she alone charm'd with the year,</br>It too with her would pleas'd appear.</br>Her presence adds a grace to Spring,</br>While softer all her warblers sing;</br>Each object, in advance she meets,</br>Exhibits all its choicest sweets;</br>Beauty her fairest form assumes,</br>More gaily smiles, or deeper blooms.", "She goes!  but not to entertain</br>The recollection light or vain,</br>Or, by Spring's native charms uncaught,</br>Idly to roam for want of thought.</br>Far other laurels she demands</br>From Virtue's consecrated hands;</br>Far other suffrages of praise,</br>Than Vice bestows, or Folly pays.", "Her mute companions most admir'd,</br>By life's disgusting sameness tir'd,</br>Are Innocence in vestment white,</br>And Fancy borne on pinion light;</br>Content, still forward to rejoice,</br>And Music with her love-tun'd voice;</br>Peace, with pleas'd brow and aspect calm,</br>And Health with breath of fragrant balm;</br>Philanthropy, of boundless view,</br>And Charity as boundless too;</br>Friendship, that scorns each false disguise,</br>And Pity, with tear-trickling eyes;</br>Taste, of quick sense and feeling just,</br>And Love, that knows no mean disgust;</br>Meekness, of feature mildly sweet,</br>Fond with Humility to meet;</br>Gay Hope, whose looks a transport wear,</br>And Silence with attentive ear;</br>Fair Modesty, that loves to walk,</br>No eye to see, no tongue to talk;</br>Candor, the rough told tale that smooths,</br>And Sympathy, that kindly soothes;</br>Lone Contemplation ready-pac'd,</br>And Solitude, in glooms solac'd;</br>Wisdom, that draws the veil from Folly,</br>And with the Muse sweet Melancholy:</br>With such associates she retires,</br>Traces their steps, their haunts admires;</br>With them her pensive hours employs,</br>And, though alone, the world enjoys.", "Oh!  when her wonted roams she takes,</br>While ev'ry sense to joy awakes,</br>Whether to yonder green alcove,</br>Yon belvedere, or spacious grove;</br>Or fine slop'd hill, that overlooks</br>Flocks, shepherds, villas, woods, and brooks;</br>Or shadowy vale, or sunny glade,</br>Or lime tree row's imbow'ring shade;</br>Or gay parterre, or terrace-walk,</br>Grac'd with each flow'r of courtly stalk;</br>Or grotto cool, or arcade green,</br>Or wilderness, with seats between:</br>Propitious may the sylvan muse,</br>In her own lov'd retreats she wooes,</br>While fields their richest tints assume,</br>And op'ning rose-buds round her bloom,</br>Her gentlest votary inspire,</br>And warm her with celestial fire!</br>May ev'ry rural scene she views,</br>With Wisdom lone retir'd to muse;</br>Whether the azure-mantled sky,</br>The wood, or brook that murmurs by;</br>The rising hill, or meadow green,</br>Where shepherds with their flocks convene;</br>The colonnade, or tow'r-grac'd wall,</br>The temple, or steep water-fall;</br>The orchard, in full glory blown,</br>Or parks, with bladed wealth o'ergrown;</br>Or flow'r-plot, where carnations bloom,</br>And gales their balmy wings perfume:</br>May all, with inspiration stor'd,</br>Some sentimental joy afford!</br>Some hint, by study vainly sought,</br>Some happy flight, some pleasing thought!</br>"]
