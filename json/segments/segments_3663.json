["Ye Poets why will ye bemoan</br>For brothers, alas!  who are dead;</br>Though Shenston, and Cunningham's gone,</br>Young Hawkins now rears up his head.</br>A branch he appears from their stem,</br>And promises blossoms to bear;</br>Who knows but he'll flourish like them?</br>Then cease to repine and despair.", "His songs they are artless and sweet,</br>His subjects most innocent are,</br>Though in all he may not be compleat,</br>Yet merit he surely must share.</br>Write on then, thou juvenile bard,</br>Pursue your lov'd pastoral strain,</br>For merit I strongly regard,</br>If my praises are simple and plain.</br>"]
