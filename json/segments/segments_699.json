["Indeed, my PHAEDRIA, if to find</br>That gold a female's vow can gain,</br>If this had e'er disturb'd your mind,</br>Or cost one serious moment's pain,</br>I should have said that all the rules</br>You learnt of moralists and schools,</br>Were very useless, very vain.", "Yet I perhaps  mistake the case;</br>And tho' with this heroic air,</br>Like one that holds a nobler chace,</br>You seem the lady's loss to bear,</br>Perhaps your heart bely'd your tongue,</br>And thinks my censure mighty wrong</br>To count it such a slight affair.", "When HESPER gilds the shaded sky,</br>Slow-winding thro' the well-known grove,</br>Methinks I see you cast your eye</br>Back to the morning scenes of love:</br>Her tender look, her graceful way,</br>The pretty things you heard her say,</br>Afresh your struggling fancy move.", "Then tell me, is your soul intire?</br>Does wisdom calmly hold her throne?</br>Then can you question each desire,</br>Bid this remain, and that begone?</br>No tear half-starting from your eye?</br>No kindling blush you know not why?</br>No stealing sigh or stifled groan?", "Away with this unmanly mood!</br>See where the hoary churl appears,</br>Whose hand hath seiz'd the fav'rite good</br>Which you reserv'd for happier years:</br>While side by side the blushing maid</br>Shrinks from his visage half-afraid,</br>Spite of the sickly joy she wears.", "Ye guardian pow'rs of love and fame,</br>This chaste, harmonious pair behold;</br>And thus reward the gen'rous flame</br>Of all who barter vows for gold.</br>O bloom of youth and opening charms</br>Well-buried in a dotard's arms!</br>O worthy price of beauty sold!", "Cease then to gaze, unthankful boy;</br>Let, let her go, the venal fair!</br>Unworthy she to give you joy;</br>Then wherefore should she give you care?</br>Lay, lay your myrtle garland down,</br>And let the willow's virgin-crown</br>With happier omens bind your hair.", "O just escap'd the faithless main,</br>Tho' driven unwilling on the land!</br>To guid your favour'd steps again,</br>Behold you better genius stand:</br>Where PLATO'S olive courts your eye,</br>Where HAMDEN'S laurel blooms on high,</br>He lifts his heav'n-directed hand.", "When these are blended on your brow,</br>The willow will be nam'd no more;</br>Or if that love-deserted bough</br>The pitying, laughing girls deplore,</br>Yet still shall I most freely swear,</br>Your dress has much a better air</br>Than all that ever bridegroom wore.</br>"]
