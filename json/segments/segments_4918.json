["Grave Muses, march in Triumph and with Praises,</br>Our Goddess here hath given you leave to land;</br>And bids this rare Dispenser of your Graces,</br>Bow down his Brow unto her sacred Hand.</br>Desert finds due in that most princely Doom,</br>In whose sweet Breast are all the Muses bred:</br>So did that great Augustus erst in Rome,</br>With Leaves of Fame, adorn his Poets hed.</br>Fair be the Guerdon of your Fairy-Queen,</br>Even of the fairest that the World hath seen.</br>"]
