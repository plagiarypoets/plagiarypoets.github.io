["And call they this Improvement? &mdash; to have changed,</br>My native Clyde, thy once romantic shore,</br>Where nature's face is banished and estranged,</br>And Heaven reflected in thy wave no more;</br>Whose banks, that sweetened May-day's breath before,</br>Lie sere and leafless now in summer's beam,</br>With sooty exhalations covered o'er;</br>And for the daisied green sward, down thy stream</br>Unsightly brick-lanes smoke, and clanking engines gleam.", "Speak not to me of swarms the scene sustains;</br>One heart free tasting Nature's breath and bloom</br>Is worth a thousand slaves to Mammon's gains.</br>But whither goes that wealth, and gladd'ning whom?</br>See, left but life enough and breathing room</br>The hunger and the hope of life to feel,</br>Yon pale Mechanic bending o'er his loom,</br>And Childhood's self as at Ixion's wheel,</br>From morn till midnight tasked to earn its little meal.", "Is this Improvement? &mdash; where the human breed</br>Degenerates as they swarm and overflow,</br>Till Toil grows cheaper than the trodden weed,</br>And man competes with man, like foe with foe,</br>Till Death, that thins them, scarce seems public woe?</br>Improvement! &mdash; smiles it in the poor man's eyes,</br>Or blooms it on the cheek of Labour? &mdash; No&mdash;</br>To gorge a few with Trade's precarious prize,</br>We banish rural life, and breathe unwholesome skies.", "Nor call that evil slight; God has not given</br>This passion to the heart of man in vain,</br>For Earth's green face, th' untainted air of Heaven,</br>And all the bliss of Nature's rustic reign.</br>For not alone our frame imbibes a stain</br>From foetid skies &mdash; the spirit's healthy pride</br>Fades in their gloom &mdash; And therefore I complain</br>That thou no more through pastoral scenes shouldst glide,</br>My Wallace's own stream, and once romantic Clyde!</br>"]
