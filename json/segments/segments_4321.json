["The shepherd of fortune possest</br>May scorn, if he please, my poor cot,</br>May think in his wealth to be blest,</br>But I will not envy his lot.</br>The pleasures which riches impart</br>Are fleeting and feeble when known;</br>They never give peace to the heart,</br>It scorns to be happy alone.", "That shepherd true happiness knows,</br>Whose bosom by beauty is mov'd,</br>Who tastes the pure pleasure that flows</br>From loving and being beloved.</br>'Tis a joy of angelical birth,</br>And when to poor mortals 'tis given,</br>It cheers their abode upon earth,</br>And sweetens the journey to heaven.", "How briskly my spirits would move!</br>What peace in this bosom would reign!</br>Were I blest with the nymph that I love,</br>Sweet Emma, the pride of the plain.</br>Ye shepherds, she's fair as the light!</br>The critic no blemish can find;</br>And all the soft virtues unite,</br>And glow in her innocent mind.", "Her accents are formed to please,</br>Her manners engagingly free,</br>Her temper is ever at ease,</br>And calm as an angel's can be.</br>Her presence all sorrow removes,</br>She enraptures the wit and the clown,</br>Her heart is as mild as the dove's,</br>Her hand is as soft as its down.", "Yon lilly, which graces the field,</br>And throws its perfume to the gale,</br>In fairness and fragrance must yield</br>To Emma, the pride of the vale.</br>She's pleasant as yonder cool rill</br>To travellers who faint on the way;</br>She's sweet as the rose on the hill,</br>When it opens its bosom to day.", "I ask not for wealth, or for power;</br>Kind Heaven!  I these can resign;</br>But hasten, O hasten the hour,</br>When Emma shall deign to be mine.</br>O teach her to pity the pain</br>Of a heart that, if slighted must break;</br>O teach her to love the fond swain,</br>That would lay down his life for her sake.", "Though poor I will never repine,</br>Content that my Emma is true;</br>I'll press her dear bosom to mine,</br>And think myself rich as Peru.</br>With her I will stray through the grove,</br>And fondly I'll pour out my soul,</br>Indulge my effusions of love,</br>And find myself blest to the full.", "And oft in the cool of the day,</br>We'll ramble to hear the sweet chorus,</br>That vibrates so soft from each spray,</br>Along the green banks of Codorus.</br>With flowers I'll crown her dear hair,</br>Then gaze on her beauties, and cry,</br>What nymph can with Emma compare!</br>What shepherd so happy as I!", "Thus cheerful the moments shall roll,</br>Of all my fond wishes possest,</br>And peace shall descend on my soul,</br>And make it her favourite rest.</br>Contentment my life shall prolong,</br>All trouble and sorrow forgot,</br>And time, as he hurries along,</br>Shall smile upon Corydon's cot.</br>"]
