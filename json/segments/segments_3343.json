["Ye were a group of stars collected here,</br>Some, mildly glowing, others sparkling bright;</br>Here rising in a region calm and clear,</br>Ye shone awhile with intermingled light;</br>Then parting, each pursuing his own flight</br>O'er the wide hemisphere, ye singly shone;</br>But ere ye climbed to half your promised height,</br>Ye sunk again with brightening glory round you thrown,</br>Each left a brilliant track as each expired alone.", "And now, ye live, above the starry spheres,</br>In sweet communion with the pure and blest;</br>Ye know no earthly change of hopes and fears,</br>But all is one unbroken heaven of rest,</br>An ocean, with no wave on all its breast.</br>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;*&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;", "Ye dwell in love and feast upon high truth,</br>And share, in that bright world beyond the tomb,</br>Unwasting vigour, and unfading youth,</br>A cherub's beauty and a seraph's bloom;</br>Ye err not, mourn not, fear no day of doom;</br>Within your breast there's nought to wake one sigh,</br>Across your brow there comes no shade of gloom;</br>The tear is wiped forever from your eye,</br>And all your souls are filled with rapture pure and high.</br>"]
