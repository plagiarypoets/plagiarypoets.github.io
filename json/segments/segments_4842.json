["The sea-bird skims along the silvery tide,</br>And screams full oft her shrill discordant lay,</br>While the tired boatmen their frail shallops guide</br>To the safe shelter of the neighboring by,</br>As evening shades fall down with mantle grey&mdash;</br>Shrouding the distant abbey's ivied tower,</br>Then slowly deep'ning as the sun's last ray</br>Leaves the sad Hermit's lonely mountain bower&mdash;</br>Hastening the time when village maidens dream,</br>And Lovers stroll beside the babbling stream.", "Now the blithe ploughman whistles on the moor,</br>As to his humble cot he wends his way&mdash;</br>While the clean housewife watches at the door,</br>And jocund urchins on the wide lawn play,</br>Unconscious of the late departed day&mdash;</br>Chasing the fire-fly by the dasied tomb;</br>Then swiftly fleeing from some lovely Fay,</br>Wander along amid the murky gloom,</br>And soon are safe within their parent's arms,</br>Who, in their joy, forget their first alarms.", "At length the bell sends forth its warning sound,</br>From the dark abbey's venerable tower;</br>And now the cottage inmates gather round,</br>(For lo! &mdash; it tells the evening service hours,)</br>To hear the Ploughman praise his Maker's power&mdash;</br>Checking each childish deed or mirthful sound;</br>Then, weary, in their heathery beds they cower,</br>While midnight's awful silence spreads around,</br>Unbroken, save by the hoarse mastiff's bay,</br>Until the cock's shrill note proclaims the day.</br>"]
