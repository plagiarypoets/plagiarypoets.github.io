["Child of the light, fair Morning Hour,</br>That smilest o'er yon purple Hill,</br>I come to woo thy cheering power</br>Beside yon murmuring rill.</br>Nor I alone &mdash; a thousand songsters rise,</br>To meet thy dawning, and thy sweets to share,</br>While every flow'r, that scents the honied air,</br>Thy milder influence feels, and shews the brightest dies.", "And let me hear some village swain</br>Whistle in rustic glee along;</br>Or share some true love's gentle pain,</br>Breath'd from the milk-maid's song.</br>Wild are those notes, but sweeter far to me,</br>Than the soft airs, borne from Italian groves,</br>To which the wanton muse, and naked loves,</br>Strike the wild warbling lyre, and dance in gamesome glee.", "And rosy Health, for whom so long</br>Mid sleepless nights I sigh'd in vain,</br>Shall throw her airy vestment on,</br>And meet me on the plain:</br>Gay laughing nymph, that loves a morning sky,</br>That loves to trip across the spangled dews,</br>And with her finger, dipp'd in brightest hues,</br>My faint cheek shall she tinge, and cheer my languid eye.", "Then will I hail the Morning Hour,</br>And singing bless the new-born day;</br>Or wand'ring in Amanda's bower,</br>Rifle the sweets of May;</br>And to my song Amanda shall attend,</br>And take the posie from the sylvan muse,</br>For sure the virtuous Fair will not refuse,</br>The Muse's modest gift, her tribute to a friend.</br>"]
