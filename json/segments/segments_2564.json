["How tediously pass the sad hours</br>That whilom trip'd nimbly along!</br>Heart-broken I seek the deep bow'rs,</br>And fly from the village gay throng.", "No longer their pastimes delight,</br>Nor afford me the joy they were wont;</br>My stomach grows sick at the sight,</br>Since Bridget, poor Bridget's &mdash; defunct!", "May comforts await her, poor soul!</br>Her like is not now on this earth:</br>Mischance has me fast by the poll,</br>Since the moment that first gave me birth.", "How oft at the grey dawn of morn,</br>Hand in hand have we trudg'd o'er the plains;</br>When the dew drop depends from the thorn,</br>And the lark first begins his sweet strains.", "How oft from yon hill did we view,</br>And praise, the gay landscape around&mdash;</br>The remembrance my sorrows renew,</br>I'm as dull as a calf in a pound.", "Near yonder old tow'r as we sat,</br>She'd mark the sad tale that I told;</br>And snivel and whine, and &mdash; all that,</br>And declare that her blood it ran cold.", "When Lubin of Bridget did prate,</br>And call'd her a thick-legged lass,</br>I gave him a rap on the pate,</br>And measur'd his length on the grass.", "But shortliv'd is all human bliss,</br>These joys are for evermore flown;</br>All my life the dear damsel I'll miss,</br>She's off! &mdash; and I'm left all alone.", "The big tear now stands in my eye,</br>My sorrows have made me quite giddy;</br>My breast sadly heaves with a sigh,</br>For ever, farewell, dearest Biddy!", "May thy manes for ever have rest,</br>Now thy carcase lies under the sod;</br>And the thistles that grow o'er thy breast,</br>For ever go niddity nod.</br>"]
