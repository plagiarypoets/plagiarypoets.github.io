["And hast thou bidden to thy harp farewell?</br>O thou, on whom divine Cecilia smil'd,</br>Who wrapt thine infant slumbers in her spell,</br>And claim'd thee from thy dawn her fav'rite child;</br>Say, wherefore hast thou now thy harp exil'd?</br>Shiver'd its chords, &mdash; in deep neglect now lying,&mdash;</br>Thou who so well could'st wake its 'witch notes wild!</br>Now murmuring deep &mdash; to plaintive airs now sighing;</br>Now sprightly o'er its strings thy rosy fingers flying.", "Yet tho' by thee to cold neglect consign'd,</br>On the glad ear no more its music stream,</br>Still lives the dear remembrance in the mind;</br>Its ling'ring echoes to my fancy seem</br>Like the faint image of a lovely dream,</br>Lighting up mem'ry with a parting ray:</br>Thus oft is view'd the midly-chasten'd beam</br>Thro' storied panes, when western splendors play,</br>With more increas'd delight than the broad glare of day.", "Its fate like a discarded lover's is;</br>It shared thy admiration for a while;</br>So he awhile, enwrapt in fancied bliss,</br>Basks in the heaven of his lady's smile;</br>But ah!  its shines on him but to beguile!</br>Another lover fills her roving eye,</br>Then recks she naught her former to exile;</br>For this new flame she mocks at oath's dread tie&mdash;</br>Hearts hard as adamant in coquettes' bosoms lie.", "Why one so fair, so young, should throw aside</br>Her tuneful harp, in sooth, 'tis hard to tell:</br>O!  it could spring not from mistaken pride,</br>Ah no!  bright excellence!  I ween full well</br>In thy fair bosom envy may not dwell.</br>Resume, dear maid, thy once-lov'd lyre resume!</br>Breathe thro' its chords thy soul-enchanting spell;</br>Seize, seize the time, while youth is in its  bloom,</br>No mirth in palsied age, &mdash; no music in the tomb.</br>"]
