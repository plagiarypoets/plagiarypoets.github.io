["The east in vermilion was drest,</br>The goldfinch sang sweet from the spray,</br>May-morn call'd the village from rest,</br>To join in the sports of the day.", "The mountains all glitter'd with gold,</br>The dew-drops bespangled the thorn,</br>The sheep had just quitted the fold,</br>And the lark flew, to hail the new morn.", "Bright Phoebus rose high in his sphere,</br>Whilst Avon reflected each ray;</br>The loves and the graces were there:</br>Myrtilla, alone, was away.", "Myrtilla, the pride of the green,</br>Myrtilla, the theme of each song&mdash;</br>Last May, saw the fair one its queen,</br>The fairest, amid the gay throng.", "A whisper, her absence makes known:</br>Each bosom now heaves with a sigh:</br>The loves and the graces seem'd flown;</br>Joy brighten'd no longer each eye.", "Their garlands all strew'd on the green,</br>With willow and ivy inwove.</br>They lament, that Myrtilla, their queen,</br>Should fall a sad victim to love.", "But, while the soft sadness prevails,</br>The knell of Myrtilla they hear:</br>The sound that's borne round on the gale,</br>Calls forth from each eye the sad tear.", "As homeward they pensively stray,</br>The tale of their queen is made known</br>And grief seem'd to lengthen the way,</br>That led o'er the lawns, to their home.</br>"]
