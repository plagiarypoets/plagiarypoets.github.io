["YEOMAN.</br>Thomas, awake!  the drum and fife I hear;</br>Unusual sounds!  my body quakes with fear!</br>What distant yells are those?  A woman's shriek!</br>'Tis no recruiting party's drunken freak!</br>Fly hence, and leave your mid-day's cheering dose&mdash;</br>The sound of war is hostile to repose.</br>Thomas, arise!  yon thatch is now in flames,</br>And from the pillag'd farm run swift the dames.</br>Too late your lev'ling plans you'll now repent;</br>Behold the curse of slothful discontent.</br>Away and gain your cot; your babes, your wife,</br>Implore your rescuing hand, to risk your life;</br>These hapless victims at your conscience lie,&mdash;</br>Rebel thou art, as Rebel thou must die.", "LABOURER.</br>Alas, my throbbing heart forebodes some ill;</br>Through all my veins unusual horrors thrill.</br>The soldier well I ween'd would prove no foe,</br>For Liberty I thought was bliss, not woe.", "YEOMAN.</br>Exchange no word, your reason comes too late;</br>Behold the troops advance &mdash; submit to fate.</br>Had you, mistaken man, no murmur spread,</br>But till'd the soil to earn your daily bread,</br>Your cant of Liberty and equal Right</br>Had never challeng'd Heaven's wrathful might:</br>At even your cot in guileless peace would rest;</br>Your wife, your children, in their sire be blest.</br>Nor daily pittance ever yet was scant,</br>When industry supply'd bare simple want;</br>Fell riot, drunkenness, the alehouse score,</br>Fill your weak brain with wild delusion's roar,</br>Your thoughts from soil, from daily labour turn'd,</br>And all the slothful man with foul disorder burn'd.", "LABOURER.</br>Ah!  well-a-day!  I thought the time would come,</br>When all the land would rise at sound of drum;</br>Dick thought the same, and Thomas said as how</br>'Twas very hard all day to go to plough,</br>And vow'd that e'en Squire Bumkin was no better,</br>Or Parson Fussock fam'd for learn'd letter,</br>Than us poor harmless volks, whom God design'd</br>With flesh and blood to be of human kind:</br>But, zure, I must confess he had his pot,</br>And seem'd as thof he had himself forgot.", "YEOMAN.</br>Peace, numskul, peace!  were all as idly prone,</br>Instead of bread, man must be fed with stone:</br>All men, 'tis true, are made of flesh and blood;</br>But brains like thine are not of self same mud.</br>God's providence distinction made; for thou</br>Canst shew no wisdom but in team or plough;</br>And could thy knavish holiday take place,</br>The strongest club would give the weakest chace,</br>Till devastation reign'd through all the land,</br>And man, supine, be lost to all command.</br>Is this the golden harvest thou would'st reap?</br>Nor peasant sows, nor shepherd tends the sheep:</br>Pluck from the thorn the berry and the crab,</br>And the rough skin prefer to woollen drab.</br>Then, booby, take thy lesson from mad France,</br>And view the consequence of random chance.</br>See o'er the champaign land a barren soil,</br>The cot forsaken, and the farm in spoil;</br>The peasants murder'd, or by rapine torn,</br>From peaceful homes, in wond'ring clans forlorn,</br>To fell banditti turn'd, embru'd in blood,</br>Their crests with crimson'd motto, \"Public good.\"</br>See where the stately castle aw'd the plain,&mdash;</br>Its lofty walls now boast their strength in vain;</br>Allegiance sworn, its vassals now rebel,</br>With demon rage like fiends let loose from hell:</br>The Chieftain's crime was birth and high descent,</br>The walls give way, the mansion straitway rent,</br>On the sharp pike the mangled head is rais'd,</br>And the damn'd deed is by the nation prais'd.</br>The sound of Liberty, and Rights of Man,</br>In blood reverberates from clan to clan;</br>Where Law has sanction'd, and where Justice ties,</br>Confusion whelms all forms, all properties;</br>And chaos reigns among the sons of men,</br>'Till God's avenging arm restores fair Peace again.</br>"]
