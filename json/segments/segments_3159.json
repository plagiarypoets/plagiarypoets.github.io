["Folly, cease thy noisy bell,</br>And shake no more thy nodding plumes at me:</br>No mirror may'st thou see</br>On the rude wall of this sequester'd cell.</br>Hence, and thy worthless toys display</br>Where two-fac'd Flatt'ry gilds the bust of Pride.</br>Or where thy meteors glide</br>In countless swarms, the Giddy and the Gay.</br>In these still shades the blust'ring roar</br>Of Ignorance perverse, the vain man's lye,</br>And fawning Treachery,</br>No more deceive me, and disgust no more.", "With eye serene and bosoms bare,</br>And brows uncharacter'd with care,</br>Come, gentle Peace, and Leisure free,</br>Daughters of Philosophy,</br>And lodge beneath this living screen,</br>Of Olive mild, and Myrtle green;</br>Near where flows a native rill,</br>Freely wand'ring where it will;</br>On whose grassy-fringed side</br>Dwells the humble Daisy py'd;</br>And the light fays in mingled dance</br>O'er the green turf featly glance.", "Or if the still-air'd Ev'ning leads</br>Thro' the cowslip-breathing meads,</br>Let us, while ladies in twilight grey</br>The gleam that clos'd the parting day,</br>Pursue fair Fancy, where she roves,</br>Thro' golden vales, and spicy groves.", "Or does inspiring Autumn shed</br>The glories of her yellow head?</br>Calmly studious shall we stray</br>O'er the leafy-matted way?</br>Oft list'ning, as we steal along,</br>The music of the plaintive song.", "Hence let me the rude paths explore</br>That winding scale yon mountain hoar.</br>Nor might the toil be counted vain,</br>If yet Euterpe wakes her strain,</br>By no vulgar eye survey'd,</br>Far within th' woodland glade.</br>If yet perchance I found the cell,</br>Where Wisdom's aweful parents dwell;</br>Permitted free my mind to store</br>With their Heav'n-suggested lore.", "These, O Solitude divine!</br>Pleasures such as these are thine.</br>Hackthorn!  well thy shades shall please,</br>Thine are pleasures such as these.</br>"]
