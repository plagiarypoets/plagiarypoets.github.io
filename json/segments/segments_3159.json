["Sweet Schuylkill, thy soft moaning stream</br>Responds to our heart-rending wo,</br>Oh, melted in Memory's dream,</br>Our tears with thy waters shall flow.", "Flow'ry banks by warm Friendship endear'd</br>How oft on thy margin we've stray'd,</br>Then verdant and bright ye appeared,</br>But now every beauty shall fade.", "Oh then with what pleasure we heard,</br>Her converse, that angels might hear,</br>From her heart's pure recess flow'd each word,</br>Which remembrance now seals with a tear.", "For gone is the virtuous maid,</br>The pride of thy village has fled,</br>Its charms are in sadness array'd,</br>Sweet Emily sleeps with the dead.", "Oh Death!  could pure Innocence save,</br>Could Mind from thy grasp the maid keep,</br>Could Friendship preserve from the grave,</br>Thou could'st not have doom'd us to weep.", "Devoid of all guile was her heart,</br>Her soul by soft feeling refined,</br>Her words could persuasion impart,</br>With manners so gentle and kind.", "And bright in her mild beaming eyes,</br>The soul of devotion still shone&mdash;</br>That soul which was form'd in the skies</br>To its Father in Heaven hath flown.", "And her's was the dignified mind,</br>Every action discretion portrayed,</br>In wit by chaste feeling refined,</br>How few could compare with the maid.", "As an angel of pity she seem'd</br>To mourn with the child of distress,</br>And her eye with sweet joy ever beam'd</br>A sorrowing victim to bless.", "Soft peace be with those she has left,</br>May that God who directed the dart</br>Yield them comfort, of comfort bereft,</br>Resignation, blest Heaven impart.</br>"]
