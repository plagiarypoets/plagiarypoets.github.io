["Hither, sparkling Folly, come,</br>Tottenham-street shall be your home!</br>Beauty here to thee is bending,</br>Peers, are at thy shrine attending;</br>Languor studies to be gay,</br>Listlessness affects to play;</br>Vapours con the tragic part,</br>Drawl and spout, and stalk and start:</br>Luxury here, entirely thine,</br>By the laws pours out the wine;</br>By thy nod, appoints the seats,</br>Culls and cooks, and carves and eats.</br>Come, O come, and lead with thee,</br>Loose and dull Festivity;</br>Maukish Pleasure's idle train,</br>Pert and silly, loud and vain&mdash;</br>Nods and becks and foppish smiles,</br>And the glance that lust beguiles;</br>Such as lurks in Lechery's eyes</br>With gloting winks, while beauty sighs.</br>Folly, bid thy train advance</br>In some strange distorting dance;</br>Deign some British Peer to shew</br>How to spin upon one toe,</br>To some Duchess deign reveal</br>The art of touching head with heel.</br>Then bring thy foreign monster here,</br>With mincing step and simpering leer,</br>With female dress and gestures lewd,</br>And vice-persuasive attitude;</br>And ever, proof 'gainst sense, prepare</br>Some German or Italian air,</br>Married to such doggrel rhyme,</br>As P&mdash; or Gr&mdash;lle calls sublime:</br>With studied squalls and labour'd squeaking</br>The tip-top voice now crowing &mdash; creaking&mdash;</br>Breaking through the cords that tie</br>Th' affrighted soul of Harmony!</br>That Orpheus' self should own how well</br>Such strains had been to sing in Hell;</br>So suited to the Devil's ear,</br>They would have quite regain'd his dear!</br>"]
