["O kind adversity, thou friend to truth!</br>By thee to virtue form'd, the human mind</br>Disdains the vanities of heedless youth;</br>How roving else, and ignorant and blind!", "When flatt'ring fortune shines with gaudy blaze,</br>In fascinating chains she holds the eye;</br>The mind is lost in error's fatal maze,</br>And dreams of lasting bliss below the sky.", "Thy friendly admonitions rouse the soul,</br>Conviction rises strong to break the snare;</br>Truth, (heav'nly guide!) appears with kind controul,</br>And fortune's painted scenes are lost in air.", "Tho' rough thy aspect, and thy frown severe,</br>'Tis but to bend the proud, the stubborn heart;</br>A soft emollient, is thy briny tear,</br>And thy corrosives pain with healing smart.", "The kindest, gentlest virtues form thy train;</br>Reflection comes with pensive musing eye,</br>And humble penitence, that not in vain</br>Presents to heav'n the supplicating sigh.", "Meek patience looks unmov'd on pain and care;</br>While cheerful hope with peace-inspiring smile,</br>Points forward thro' the gloom, celestial fair!</br>The woes of life, her whisper can beguile.", "Beyond the woes of life she lifts her eyes,</br>And often meditates a joyful flight;</br>By faith, her radiant sister, taught to rise,</br>To distant prospects of immense delight.", "O kind adversity, without thy aid,</br>How faintly would these virtues warm the breast!</br>Why should I tremble at the darksome shade?</br>For who without adversity is blest?", "Thy wholesome cold, like winter, kills the weeds</br>Which in th' uncultur'd mind luxuriant rise;</br>Then heav'nly wisdom sows her precious seeds,</br>Nor shall they want the blessing of the skies.", "But O may heav'n thy rig'rous hand restrain,</br>May'st thou correct and teach, but not destroy!</br>Thy needful lessons then shall not be vain,</br>And thy short sorrows work my lasting joy.</br>"]
