["In a comfortless Chamber was laid,</br>A Wife full of Sorrow and Grief;</br>While a Pillow supported her Head,</br>From Heav'n she implored some Relief.</br>The Gods who stood list'ning by,</br>With Complacence gave Ear to her Moan,</br>As sadly complaining she cry'd,</br>I fear my dear Johnny is gone.", "Why did I consent he shou'd brave</br>The Tempests and Battles for Gain,</br>Or trust that the boist'rous Wave</br>Wou'd bear him safe over the Main:</br>When Thousands are laid in the Deep,</br>While their Consorts are left in Despair,</br>The Fate of their Husbands to weep,</br>And with Madness and Shrieks fill the Air.", "Ye Powers who know my fond Heart,</br>Protect my dear Johnny from Harm,</br>From his Breast turn aside every Dart,</br>Calm the Winds and the Seas with thy Arm,</br>In Safety return the brave Youth,</br>To his Helen convey him with Speed,</br>In Reward for her Sufferings and Truth,</br>The mutual his Love let her read.", "Yet how foolish am I to deceive,</br>With the Hopes of such Bliss, my poor Heart;</br>Or how can I vainly believe</br>He designs I shou'd share any Part:</br>While he after Variety roves,</br>And is fond of each Songstress he hears,</br>No Matter if she whom he loves</br>Be Widow, or Wife, or in Years.", "All you my Acquaintance so near,</br>Who are sorry to know my hard Fate,</br>Whatever I suffer, forbear,</br>Forbear to reproach my dear Mate:</br>For his Heart is so fickly form'd,</br>That to one he can never be true;</br>Then beware, for howe'er you're adorn'd,</br>You'll ne'er fix him while one there is new.", "Great Jove, when he heard her Complaint,</br>With Pity his Godhead was mov'd,</br>Swore by Styx she no more shou'd lament,</br>But conquer the Heart that she lov'd.</br>No more shall she sigh nor complain,</br>That her Johnny is fickle and frail,</br>Or accuse him of Slights or Disdain,</br>For her Truth over all shall prevail.</br>"]
