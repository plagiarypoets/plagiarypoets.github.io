["The death-bell toll'd at midnight, and that bell</br>Sent sorrow upon England swift and deep;</br>For on her heart had smote the heavy knell,</br>And England's tears were those that children weep</br>In honour o'er a father's final sleep.</br>But to her spirit solemn memories cling,</br>For round the bier transcendent visions sweep,</br>Swelling with patriot pride the heart they wring;</br>That midnight death-bell toll'd the parting of her King.", "That hour the mortal from his pain had flown</br>To put on immortality &mdash; the shroud</br>Now wrapt the stately form that filled a throne&mdash;</br>Time's chilling hand had pressed it, and a cloud</br>Of anguish on the noble mind had bowed.</br>He waited for his summons; but the land</br>Still to his throne the heart's old homage vowed,</br>Loved with instinctive love the old command,</br>Honoured the head uncrown'd, and pale, unsceptered hand.", "His morning rose in bright tranquility,</br>And England gloried in the glorious beam;</br>But storms soon came, and Earth was like a sea</br>Uptorn by battling winds; War's bloody gleam</br>Shoots o'er it fiercer than the lightning stream,</br>Earth's thrones in that wild tumult rush and reel</br>Like mighty vessels, that thro' every seam</br>Let death within, while more than thunder-peal,</br>Or whirlwind, roar around each sweeping, shatter'd keel.", "But England's ship, tho' many a sail and shroud</br>Were from her torn, still proudly stemm'd the tide;</br>Her banner, towering o'er the wave of blood,</br>The thunders answer'd from her brazen side,</br>Till round the noble ship the tempest died,</br>And round the shore did Earth's rejoicings ring.</br>But he has past away, her Regal guide</br>Thro' that wild, glorious day of suffering,</br>And England by his grave now weeps her Father and her King.</br>"]
