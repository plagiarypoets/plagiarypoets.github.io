["Thou said'st thy hand would gently shred</br>Spring's first-born child, the snow-drop dear,</br>From shelterless and lonely bed,</br>And bring the herald blossom here&mdash;</br>I would have kissed the lucid thing,</br>Redeemed from winter's icy wing,</br>And called thee Love's soft queen protecting timid Spring.", "Yet March hath owned a better day,</br>And nymphs begin to braid the bower;</br>Yet longing weeks have lagged away,</br>Nor thou hast come, nor other flower&mdash;</br>And is it, Mary, sadly true,</br>That woman's words are but as dew,</br>Descending all as soft, as soon exhaling too?", "Time was, and memory weeps that time,</br>With other step when wont to move,</br>I met young spring on mountain clime,</br>Or roamed the rocks in quest of love.</br>Then sang my wild harp welcome wild,</br>Health's sun rose bright, amd beauty smiled,</br>I was a weak, indeed, but happy, happy child!", "That sun hath fled my riper day,</br>Or feebly gleams, eclipsed and dim;</br>And who will tooth the sick man's way?</br>Nor Spring revives, nor flower, for him,</br>Nor beauty lights his lonely bower;</br>He weeps away his vernal hour,</br>Nightly and lone he weeps, like that rath snowdrop flower.", "On earth the wretch can lose no more,</br>O blessed health who loseth thee;</br>A nuisance cast on life's lee shore,</br>Like shattered bark, unworthy sea&mdash;</br>The war-ship's streamers flaunt on high,</br>The merry pinnace dances by,</br>Unheeding all of him, there laid alone to die.", "Even she, whose sweetly-artless wile,</br>Might wake a dawn round dark decree,</br>Withdraws the spring that waits her smile,</br>Nor deigns to cull a flower for me;</br>From sickness beauty turns her ray,</br>And love as lightly wings away,</br>No solace left me now but harping simple lay.</br>"]
