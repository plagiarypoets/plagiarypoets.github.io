["Hence false Hopes, and quivering Fears,</br>Anxious Sighs and torturing Cares,</br>Fly from us to stately Courts,</br>Fly where mimic Fortune sports,</br>Where no Joy in Mirth we see,</br>And Sorrows only real be.</br>From our Country Pleasures, fly,</br>Troop of Human Misery,</br>But come placid serene Looks,</br>Clear as be the Crystal Brooks,</br>Come fair Peace and serene Mind,</br>In these true Pleasures we can find.</br>Here's no antick Mask or Dance,</br>But of Kids that frisk and prance;</br>Here no Wars are ever seen,</br>But 'tween two Lambs upon the Green,</br>Here no Wounds are ever found,</br>Save what the Plowshare gives the Ground:</br>Here are no entrapping Baits,</br>To hasten on too hasty Fates,</br>Save of Fish, who like Men look</br>On the Bait, but not the Hook;</br>Here's no Envy, save among</br>The Birds, for Prize of their sweet Song:</br>O bless'd Groves!  O!  may ye be</br>Ever Mirths best Nursery.</br>May fair Peace and pure Content,</br>Here for ever pitch their Tent,</br>And through every circling Year,</br>May we ever find them here.</br>"]
