["Now to the rosy-finger'd Train of May,</br>At length the dreary Hours of Winter yield:</br>No more the Hoar-frost chills the new-born Day,</br>No more the wild Winds blast the flow'ry Field.", "Now from yon Orchard, lovely to the Sight!</br>A balmy Fragrance breathe the Zephyr's Bland;</br>While in luxuriant Foliage, proudly dight,</br>The sacred Fathers of the Forest stand.", "Behold yon Pine, that lifts its Silver Head,</br>Deep in the Bosom of the pathless Glade:</br>Who now, to wander where its Branches spread,</br>Will quit the Fragrance of the vernal Shade.", "Yet when the blooming Beauties of the Wood,</br>By Winter chill'd they leafy Glories yield,</br>Thy Boughs superior to the Storm have stood,</br>And flourish'd, verdant 'midst the russet Field.", "Mindful of this, my votive Hands shall cull</br>Each Product fair of April's fruitful Show'rs,</br>From each gay Shrub its blushing Honors pull,</br>And on thy Branches hang the various Flow'rs.", "And here, when Phoebus gilds the rising Day,</br>I'll often strike with grateful Hand the Lyre;</br>And thou, 'midst vernal Groves, shalt hear a Lay,</br>Which Friendship, Faith, and Constancy inspire.</br>"]
