["To you (deare Nimph) whose wit, and forme, exflames</br>A world of spirits, with wonder of your graces,</br>That (in their strength) pursew no higher ames,</br>Then how to give your bounties soveraigne places.</br>I heere am bolde, to make extent of will,</br>Though not of power.  Pardon my first essay:</br>I goe by night, now to the Muses hill:</br>But I may live, to drinke there, at Mid-day.</br>O then:  my soule shall flow through my cleare vaines,</br>And (taking light from your bright vertues spheare)</br>Pay richer duties, in farre-sweeter straines,</br>Tun'd to your worth, and set to every eare.</br>Had I a Spencers spirit, a Daniels powers:</br>Th' extracted quintessence were only yours.</br>"]
