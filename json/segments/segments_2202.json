["And art thou gone, whom late &mdash; so late &mdash; I knew,</br>In maiden loveliness and beauty blooming!</br>And art thou gone, thy bridal wreath so new,</br>Its primal sweets are still the air perfuming,</br>While she who wore it, lies beneath, consuming!&mdash;</br>Thy life was like a dream, or vision fair,</br>With angel form the captive's cell illuming;</br>Whose beauties melt into the viewless air,</br>And leave the waking wretch to weep and wonder there!", "And thou art gone! &mdash; I little thought to sing</br>Thy funeral dirge, dear spirit: &mdash; I, who hung,</br>As if to heaven's own accents listening&mdash;</br>With a strange mystic pleasure on thy tongue;</br>Aye fancying in its tones the syren song</br>My sick hopes faintly dreamed of! &mdash; I drew near</br>Once to thy side, and shunn'd the gentle throng:</br>Ah!  little thoughtful, 'mid that converse dear,</br>What foes were close at hand: &mdash; thy bridal and thy bier!", "Thy breast was a pure haven for the loves,</br>And virtues, sojourning on earth awhile</br>Blending at once the gentleness of doves,</br>And wisdom of the snake, without its guile;&mdash;</br>Truth on thy lip, and friendship in thy smile.</br>Sure, thou wert dear to many:  yet sincerer</br>No heart, than mine, clung to thee &mdash; woe the while:</br>And oft, I wished that I had known thee nearer,</br>Yet now, I wish it not &mdash; for then, thou hadst been dearer.</br>"]
