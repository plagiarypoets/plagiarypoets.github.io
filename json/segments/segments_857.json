["For noble ancestry renown'd,</br>Thousands shall in oblivion lie;</br>Thousands with noisy triumph crown'd,</br>Unnotic'd by the Muse shall die:</br>For thee, M&mdash;r, she wakes her living lyre,</br>Nor suffers worth, like thine, in silence to expire.", "O Friend!  O Father!  for that name</br>May well become thy generous care,</br>Which far beyond the kindred claim</br>Stood forth &mdash; and rais'd me from despair:</br>Then on my infant unform'd mind, first bade</br>Instruction's copious dews their genial influence shed.", "And as I riper years attain'd,</br>What vig'rous beams thy friendship threw;</br>Affection not by art maintain'd,</br>No pride, no caprice, e'er withdrew:</br>Guide of my life!  blest instrument of heaven!</br>By whom its boundless love has peace and freedom given.", "Thee now triumphant from the tomb,</br>By Mercy's radiant arms embrac'd;</br>Thee has thy Maker's gracious doom,</br>High in supreme salvation plac'd:</br>Where those bright virtues late our boast below,</br>Expand in ample shade, and heavenly fruits bestow.", "There present to the Omniscient Mind,</br>Thy mortal works sweet incense rise:</br>Labours of love and zeal refin'd,</br>The tears of joy from grateful eyes,</br>The genuine transports of reliev'd distress,</br>Bursting in hymns of praise, thy godlike bounty bless.", "O from the glories of that place,</br>With angels in communion blest!</br>From endless joys a little space,</br>Attend a once-lov'd friend's request;</br>To sacred Pity's seat in power sublime,</br>Where never meek Desire did unaccepted climb.", "Be mine to sooth this earthly road,</br>Thy pure, sequester'd, calm retreat;</br>The conscious presence of thy God!</br>Unblemish'd life, and death sedate;</br>In one short sentence to comprize the whole,</br>May Heaven transfuse to me the virtues of thy soul.</br>"]
