["Ye nymphs and ye shepherds who rove</br>Where lately soft harmony dwelt;</br>Where breasts full of friendship and love</br>The raptures of poetry felt,", "Now cease the dull strain of your lays;</br>Let your sports, let your pastimes be o'er;</br>Let pleasure no more crown your days;</br>Let the dance and the song be no more.", "Where is Strephon, the pride of the plain,</br>Who caroll'd so sweetly of love;</br>Who gladden'd each nymph and each swain;</br>Whose pipe has made vocal each grove?", "Where is Colin the witty and gay;</br>More sweet than the linnet's his strains;</br>More blithe than the thrush on the spray?</br>Alas!  they have quitted the plains!", "Ah!  the days are still fresh in my view</br>When ye sought where the wild daisy grows,</br>And cull'd each sweet flow'ret that grew</br>To deck fair Monimia's brows.", "In your bosoms when generous fire</br>The charms of Narcissa could move;</br>And who but the strains must admire</br>Of genius inspir'd by love?", "Then the shepherds were happy around,</br>Then Corydon pride of the throng,</br>Oft made his soft warblings resound</br>The vallies and woodlands along.", "Then Alicia rais'd such sweet strains</br>As wantonly melt in the throat,</br>Resounding thro' woods and thro' plains,</br>While echo prolong'd each breath'd note.", "Each shepherd acknowledged the praise</br>That to merit superior is due,</br>And grateful the well-deserv'd bays</br>They, Strephon, allotted to you.", "For virtue approv'd thy sweet airs,</br>And pleasure in soft silken chains</br>In bondage could lead all our cares</br>And bind the grim giant of pain.", "But now no bright objects appear</br>The once ravish'd sense to delight;</br>No music to charm the dull ear;</br>No beauty to gladden the sight.", "The plains are all gloomy around;</br>Each swain joyless tends his few sheep;</br>His tabor each throws on the ground&mdash;</br>They have nothing to do but to weep.</br>"]
