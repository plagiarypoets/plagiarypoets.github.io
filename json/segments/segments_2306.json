["Group after group are gathering &mdash; Such as prest</br>Once to their Saviour's arms, and gently laid</br>Their cherub heads upon his shielding breast,</br>Though sterner souls the fond approach forbade;&mdash;</br>Group after group glide on with noiseless tread</br>And round Jehovah's sacred altar meet,</br>Where holy thoughts in infant hearts are bred,</br>And holy words their ruby lips repeat,</br>Oft with a chasten'd glance, in modulation sweet.&mdash;", "Yet some there are, upon whose childish brows</br>Wan poverty hath done the work of care,</br>Look up, ye sad ones! &mdash; 'tis your Father's house,</br>Beneath whose consecrated dome you are;</br>More gorgeous robes ye see, and trappings rare,</br>And watch the gaudier forms that gaily move,</br>And deem perchance, mistaken as you are</br>The \"coat of many colors\" proves His love,</br>Whose sign is in the heart and whose reward above.", "And ye, blest laborers in this humble sphere,</br>To deeds of saintlike charity inclin'd,</br>Who from your cells of meditation dear</br>Come forth to gird the weak, untutor'd mind,&mdash;</br>Yet ask no payment, save one smile refin'd</br>Of grateful love, &mdash; one tear of contrite pain,</br>Meekly ye forfeit to your mission kind</br>The rest of earthly Sabbaths. &mdash; Be your gain</br>A Sabbath without end, 'mid yon celestial plain.</br>"]
