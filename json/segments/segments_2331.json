["Another!  'tis a sad word to the heart,</br>That one by one has lost its hold on life,</br>From all it lov'd or valued, forc'd to part</br>In detail.  Feeling dies not by the knife</br>That cuts at once and kills &mdash; its tortur'd strife</br>Is with distilled affliction, drop by drop</br>Oozing its bitterness.  Our world is rife</br>With grief and sorrow; all that we would prop,</br>Or would be propp'd with, falls &mdash; when shall the ruin stop!", "The sea has one, and Palestine has one,</br>And Scotland has the last:  The snooded maid</br>Shall gaze in wonder on the stranger's stone,</br>And wipe the dust off with her tartan plaid&mdash;</br>And from the lonely tomb where thou art laid,</br>Turn to some other monument &mdash; nor know</br>Whose grave she passes, or whose name she read&mdash;</br>Whose lov'd and honoured relics lie below;</br>Whose is immortal joy, and whose is mortal woe.", "There is a world of bliss hereafter &mdash; else</br>Why are the bad above &mdash; the good beneath</br>The green grass of the grave.  The Mower fells</br>Flowers and briers alike.  But man shall breathe</br>(When he his desolating blade shall sheathe</br>And rest him from his work,) in a pure sky,</br>Above the smoke of burning worlds; &mdash; and Death</br>On scorched pinions with the dead shall lie,</br>When time, with all his years and centuries, has passed by.</br>"]
