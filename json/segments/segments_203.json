["AMINTAS, ADMETAS.", "THE ARGUMENT.</br>Distrest Amintas sits and mournes,</br>All proferd joy, and solace scornes,</br>He tells the story of his woes</br>Piteous to heare.  Admetas does</br>His utmost to asswage his griefe,</br>But Counsell yeelds him no reliefe</br>Nought will asswage it, to the skies,</br>He sadly shoots a look, and dies.", "ADMETAS.</br>Amintas wherefore dost thou moane</br>As if all thy joyes were gone,</br>Up man, leave this uncouth shade,</br>This tenebrous and fatall glade,</br>Where none but Satyrs us'd to prance,</br>And the nimble Faeries daunce;</br>See, thy sheep go all astray,</br>Thy belt and scrip is stol'n away,</br>Thy pipe lies neere the Brook in twaine,</br>Chear up, O thou dejected Swaine.", "AMINTAS.</br>Cease (good Admetas) thy harsh din,</br>And know I suffer for my sin,</br>Under this broad spreading Beech,</br>Whose curled front to Heaven doth reach,</br>I'le lie, and listen to the Owle,</br>And languishing sigh out my Soule.", "ADMETAS.</br>So to dare thy frowning Fate,</br>Argues thee madly desperate,</br>Most loved Shepheard, what may be</br>The cause of thy great miserie?", "AMINTAS.</br>O Friend, t'will but augment my grief,", "ADMETAS.</br>To breath one woe is some reliefe,</br>All the Shepheards of the plaine</br>Mourn for thee delicious Swaine,</br>They sorrow that thy Pipe is still,</br>Which came so near to Astrophill,</br>Yea, wont aswell to please the route,</br>As the rare Layes of Collin Clout:</br>Their Oaten Reeds they also break,</br>And make great sorrow for thy sake.", "AMINTAS.</br>May they be happy, I am lost,</br>Split when I hope to harbour most,</br>I feell the frozen hand of death,</br>But yet before I yeeld my Breath,</br>Ile tell thee (dear Friend) ere thou goe,</br>The cause and progresse of my woe.", "ADMETAS.</br>Here Il'e lie down, proceed to tell,", "AMINTAS.</br>Admetas hear and mark mee well,</br>Thou knewst faire Cloris, lovely faire,</br>Who tyed wing'd Cupid in her haire,</br>The little god being glad to stay,</br>Did with his golden fetters play,</br>Lovely as Hebe, fairer farre</br>Then she the plumpe god made a starre;</br>As coldly chaste as ere was shee,</br>Titan turnd to Lawrell tree,</br>Wise as Tritonia, her bright eyes,</br>Dazl'd Apollo in his rise,</br>Her forehead cheerefull, corrall lip'd,</br>Her cheekes were Roses in milk dipt,</br>Fingers such as Aurora faire</br>When pleating her old Tythons haire,</br>This goddesse of my life and I</br>(Joynd in mutuall amities)</br>By Hymen to the Temple led,</br>Dame Flora having deck'd our bed,</br>To add unto our active sports</br>Fortune who still our wishes thwarts</br>Joyning with Atropos, conspired,</br>To kill the thing I so desired,</br>Chloris in the Temple dies,</br>Her Nuptialls are her Obsequies.", "ADMETAS.</br>Most gentle Shepheard I confesse,</br>Thou hast great cause of heavinesse,</br>But wise men have concluded still</br>Tis vaine to waile and helplesse ill.", "AMINTAS.</br>Her memory remaines with me,</br>Although her body buried be,</br>Ye purling brooks, who murmuring</br>Still run on errands to your King,</br>Earth-shaking Neptune, bid him rore</br>Untill he do eat up the shore,</br>And let his Tritons loud resound</br>The cause, and dolour of my wound,</br>Both Death, and Destinie, and Hell,</br>Avernus, where the Furies dwell,</br>With the loathsome stream of Stix,</br>In their Counsels do commix</br>For to rob me of my Blisse,</br>Staying my Love in shadie Dis.", "ADMETAS.</br>What frenzie doth possess thy brain,</br>O thou late most honoured Swaine?</br>But Love I know no Law abides,</br>Since his great power, Heaven guides,</br>And all things that on earth survive,</br>Without they love they never thrive.</br>\"Love altereth nature, ruleth Reason,</br>Makes vice a Virtue, Virtue Treason.\"</br>Jove, whose voice Olympus shakes,</br>Love, to be transformed makes.</br>Love caus'd Hypollitus with briers</br>(Shunning Phaedras lustfull fires)</br>To be out of his Chariot born,</br>And into many peices torn.</br>Love layd Absyrtus limbs o'th Strand,</br>Scattered by his Sisters hand,</br>Forc'd Pasiphae (that impious trull)</br>To the embraces of a Bull.</br>Love great Alcides did betray,</br>And while upon Polixena</br>Achilles doated, he was slaine,</br>(Rhamnusia so her will did gaine.)</br>Love, smooth Leander did compell</br>To swim the Helespont so well.</br>No marvell then that thou art tane</br>(Admintas) thus unto thy bane,</br>These were with living beauties fir'd</br>By thee a dead Maid is desir'd.", "AMINTAS.</br>Admetas, cease t' upbraid my will,</br>'Lesse thou hast Podalyrius skill,</br>And with thy oyntments canst asswage</br>The fire that in my heart doth rage,</br>In direfull sobbing, sighs and teares,</br>Perpetuall plaints Il'e spend my years,</br>On Rocks, in Dens, and deserts I</br>Will breath my woes incessantly,</br>Farewell for ever, my deare Flocks,</br>Ye Woods, ye Rivers, and ye Rocks,</br>A black stone ever on this day,</br>Let each true Lover cast away;</br>On which let Titan never shine,</br>But let the clustering clouds combine</br>For to obscure the sight of day,</br>And dim the glories of his ray,</br>Let loathsome snakes loud hissing keep,</br>And scaly fishes leave the deep,</br>To come on shore, let scritch-owles sing</br>Myrtles wither, Willowes spring;</br>Dearest Chloris, see I come</br>To meet thee in Elizium.</br>"]
