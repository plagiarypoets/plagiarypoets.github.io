["In lonely shades, from mortal view retired,</br>A youth indulged his solitary woe;</br>A pudding's loss his mournful muse inspired,</br>And bade his melancholy numbers flow.", "Ah!  luckless fate, he cried, of human things!</br>All, all must hasten to the silent tomb:</br>While time flies by on unrelenting wings,</br>Puddings and empires meet one common doom.", "The pride of sewet and the pomp of flower,</br>And all, that apples, all, that paste e'er gave,</br>Await alike the inevitable hour:</br>The paths of puddings lead but to the grave.", "Oh!  pudding, loveliest of the pudding race!</br>Whose fond idea wakes my constant woe,</br>How didst thou shine, adorn'd with every grace,</br>That apples, flower, and sewet could bestow!", "How didst thou shine, my pudding, on the board!</br>How my mouth water'd for thy charms divine!</br>What beauteous nymph such raptures could afford!</br>What lover's transports ever equall'd mine!", "Oh!  cursed fate!  one little moment past,</br>And thou, my lovely pudding, wast no more!</br>How short the time my joys were doom'd to last!</br>How soon my dream of happiness was o'er!", "Could I but clasp thee in my ardent jaws;</br>Could I but feast upon thy charms divine;</br>Gladly I'd scorn the giddy world's applause,</br>All earthly blessings gladly I'd resign.", "But ah!  it ne'er was given me to possess</br>Such matchless sweets, by fate's abhorr'd decree;</br>For other mouths those sweets were doom'd to bless,</br>Nor was there left one little bit for me!</br>"]
