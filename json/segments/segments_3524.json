["Come thou rosy smiling health,</br>Far more lov'd than pomp or wealth;</br>Come, and grace the poet's strain,</br>Come with Pleasure in thy train!</br>From the busy world I fly,</br>Nor for grandeur heave a sigh;</br>Pleasure shall my Goddess be;</br>Rosy Health, she dwells with thee.</br>Chiefs renown'd in glorious war,</br>Sages of experience rare,</br>Busy sons of trade and noise,</br>Hence!  and leave me to my joys.</br>What is glory?  What is Fame?</br>Wisdom, what? &mdash; an empty name:</br>Be my brows with roses crown'd,</br>Pleasure, dancing in thy round!</br>Yet Excess be far away,</br>Thou art rosy Health's decay;</br>Pleasure thou can'st ne'er approve,</br>Pleasure still the soul of love.</br>Cyprian Goddess, fair and young,</br>Bring him with his golden darts,</br>Vanquishing, yet blessing hearts!</br>Fear, distrust, be far away!</br>Jaundic'd eyes that shun the day:</br>Love!  Oh, let me dwell with thee,</br>Still from jealous Folly free!</br>Thus may varying seasons roll,</br>Free from every strict controul,</br>Till my later years advance,</br>Slowly in the mystic dance.</br>Let no churlish laws of age,</br>Ev'n declining life engage;</br>Vigorous, gay, and light as air,</br>May I yet defy Old Care.</br>Pleasure still the course attend,</br>Bring my mistress, wine, and friend:</br>For from these I ne'er can part,</br>These shall glad my dying heart.</br>Yet may innocence be there,</br>Mirth with her alone I share.</br>Well I know, though gay and free,</br>Pleasure, Virtue dwells with thee.</br>"]
