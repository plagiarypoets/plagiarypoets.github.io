["O for the Warblings of the Doric Oate,</br>That wept the Youth deep-whelm'd in Ocean's Tide;</br>Or for the mournful Muse, whose varying Note</br>Chanted how dear the laurell'd Sydney dy'd:</br>Then should my Woes in worthy Strain be sung,</br>And with due Cypress-Wreath thy Herse, O FRED'RICK, hung!", "But tho, my novice-hands are all too weak</br>To grasp the tuneful Reed, my Voice unskill'd</br>The graceful Words of Poesy to speak,</br>Tho' rude the Cadence of my Wood-Notes wild,</br>Yet shall not tend'rest Duty bid me tell</br>How great, how just, how good the matchless FRED'RICK fell?", "How well he knew to leave the loftier Scene,</br>To throw the Pomp of purple State aside,</br>Led by calm Thought to Bow'rs of Eglantine,</br>And high-arch'd Walks on Thames's sacred Side;</br>To loose himself in Landscapes lone and still,</br>Where Contemplation sate on Cliefden's beech-clad Hill?", "How lock'd in pure-ey'd Concord's golden Band,</br>With his bless'd Bride, thro' Wedlock's hallow'd Ways</br>With even Step he walk'd, and constant Hand,</br>His Temples binding with domestic Bays;</br>How in each Science most sublime he shone,</br>And crop'd the fairest Flow'rs of silver Helicon?", "How to sweet Poesy, all-bounteous Lord,</br>He never barr'd his princely Palace-gate,</br>But bade his Thomson share the regal-Board,</br>With classic Converse seas'ning empty State;</br>Hence felt the exulting Bard a mighty Rage,</br>With bolder Buskin hence, he dar'd to tread the Stage.</br>"]
