["Say, lovely Cynthia, why thy beam benign</br>Allays the painful heavings of the breast?</br>Say whence its pleasing influence over mine,</br>To sooth the anguish of my heart to rest?</br>O freely shed thy mild mellifluence here,</br>I would no other smile to wipe the bitter tear.", "Luna, my hopes (thy natal hours) more slow,</br>I long to greet thy lucid orb again;</br>Thy nonage fled, I hail thy halcyon glow,</br>And wish, sweet plausive orb, thou'dst never wane:</br>Then mem'ry urges not the cruel smart,</br>But heavenly rapture calms and sooths my breaking heart.", "When in the sylvan vista I recline,</br>And note thy progress through the bending trees,</br>I start, sweet goddess, for I oft opine</br>I hear thy voice symphonious in the breeze;</br>Again I turn; ah, Cynthia were it you;</br>I turn again, unconscious of the dew!", "Oh!  as thy lucid phase I nightly woo,</br>Fly sorrow's theme &mdash; the dark despairing thought,</br>Sweet sadness' eye-drop clouds my wishful view,</br>For well I muse thy beams are pity-fraught;</br>Then, Cynthia, shed thy mild mellifluence here,</br>And check the rising sigh, and wipe the bitter tear.</br>"]
