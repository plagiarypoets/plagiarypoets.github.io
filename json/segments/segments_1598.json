["Oh Blackmore!  Why do'st thou alone refuse</br>To grace Ramillia with thy noble Muse,</br>Where British Valour urg'd by CHURCHILL on,</br>Has all that went before, and has it self out-done?</br>How canst thou answer to thy self and Fame</br>A Victory like this &mdash; without thy Name?", "Or, do'st thou still for the Great WILLIAM grieve,</br>Tho' he will ever in thy Arthur live?</br>Or, is One Poet to One Heroe due,</br>T' AUGUSTUS Virgil, and to WILLIAM You?</br>Or, is this Age not worthy of thy Care,</br>That did not thy Illustrious Arthur spare?", "Grieve not for Him whom thou hast deathless made;</br>Whose Laurels, like thy own, will never fade.</br>Thy Artful Hand, and thy Harmonious Pen</br>Can Men immortal make, and live agen.</br>'Tis true, BRITANNIA is of Him bereft,</br>But He his Mantle has to ANNA left;</br>Who doubly with his spirit blest, has done</br>All that he hop'd and more &mdash; and has ev'n Him out-run.", "So vast a Genius and so large a Mind</br>Can never to One Heroe be confin'd.</br>In ANNA'S Reign thou hast ELIZA grac't,</br>The Present Age out-shining far the Past.</br>For, whate'er Fame to Her advantage tells,</br>The Copy the Original excels.", "If Thou and thy Great Arthur were condemn'd,</br>It was not Thou but Virtue was contemn'd;</br>Whose Cause thou nobly fought'st, and did'st maintain:</br>Oppos'd by Sworn Confederates in vain.", "Rouze then &mdash; and reassume thy tuneful Lyre:</br>This CHURCHILL &mdash; This thy COUNTRY does require.</br>What if Ten Thousand Sick thy Absence grieve?</br>Let 'em grieve on, so CHURCHILL ever live.</br>His Fame to Vulgar Lives shou'd be prefer'd</br>Of the Ignoble Undistinguish'd Herd.", "Tate, as in Duty bound, has somewhat said;</br>But He his Office not his Muse obey'd.", "But Prior does in Spencer's Style endite,</br>With the same spirit that the English Fight.</br>Thought so sublime, Expression so correct</br>Ever more Honour, than they give, reflect.</br>For tho' his Heroe to the Stars be rais'd,</br>'Tis nobler so to praise, than to be prais'd.", "Some Minor Poets too have done their best:</br>Tho' small their Skill, yet their good Will's exprest.", "De Foe, as ever, Execrably bad,</br>Throws out a Hasty Poem, wrote like Mad.</br>'Twas the first-born, and welcome in our Mirth,</br>Tho' not One Muse assisted at its birth.", "Some more, below the dignity of Verse,</br>In short-liv'd Lines wou'd glorious Deeds rehearse.", "Oh!  give us a true Specimen of Wit,</br>Thou know'st it best &mdash; Thou Master art of it.</br>Do thou exert thy self, and let us see</br>A Poem worthy CHURCHILL, worthy Thee.</br>Thy Muse, like the fam'd Beauty of a Town,</br>If seen abroad, the day is all her own.</br>Each Puny-Wit draws back, and hides his Head,</br>And does inimitable Patterns dread.", "Do you but Write, and All will silent be:</br>For what Bold Man will dare to follow thee?</br>Do you Ramillia's Bloody Plains describe,</br>You Distance strait the whole Poetic Tribe.</br>Praise is the Most to which the Best pretend;</br>But wonder and Surprize thy Works attend.", "What may we not expect when such a Muse</br>Shall such a Theme and such a Heroe choose?</br>By CHURCHILL'S Actions and Examples fir'd,</br>Ev'n meaner Pens than thine may be inspir'd.</br>But when the Muse and Subject are compleat,</br>The World with justice hopes for somewhat Great.</br>Our utmost hopes, I know, (Vast tho' they be)</br>Of a full answer cannot fail from Thee.</br>And if my Poorer Muse shall waken Thine,</br>Some share at least of Glory will be mine:</br>As He, who warn'd by me begins to Arm,</br>Does owe the Victory to my Alarm.</br>"]
