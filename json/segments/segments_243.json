["Thou matchless Poet, whose capacious Mind</br>Contains the whole that Knowledge can impart,</br>Where we each charming Science find,</br>And every pleasing Art:</br>Permit my Muse in plain unpolish'd Verse,</br>In humble Strains her Wonder to rehearse:</br>From her low Shade she lifts her dazl'd Sight,</br>And views the Splendor and amazing Height:</br>Sees boundless Wit, in artful Numbers play,</br>And like the Glorious Source of Day,</br>To distant Worlds, both Light and Heat convey.", "Before the happy Birth of Light,</br>E'er Nature did her forming Pow'r display,</br>While blended in their native Night,</br>The Principles of all things lay;</br>Triumphant Darkness did her self dilate,</br>And thro' the Chaos with resistless Sway</br>Her dusky Horrors spread;</br>Such in this Isle was once our wretched State:</br>Dark melancholy Night her sable Wings display'd,</br>And all around her baleful Influence shed;</br>From Gloom to Gloom, with weary'd Steps we stray'd,</br>Till Chaucer came with his delusive Light,</br>And gave some transient Glimm'rings to the Night:</br>Next kinder Spencer with his Lunar Beams</br>Inrich'd our Skies, and wak'd us from our Dreams:</br>Then pleasing Visions did our Minds delight,</br>And airy Spectres danc'd before our Sight:</br>Amidst our Shades in antick Rounds we mov'd,</br>And the bright entertaining Phantoms lov'd.", "With Waller our first Dawn of Light arose,</br>He did the Beauties of the Morn disclose:</br>Then Milton came, and Cowley blest our Eyes;</br>With Joy we saw the distant Glory rise:</br>But there remain'd some Footsteps of the Night,</br>Dark Shadows still were intermix'd with Light:</br>Those Shades the mighty Dryden chas'd away,</br>And shew'd the Triumphs of refulgent Day:</br>Now all is clear, and all is bright,</br>Our Sun from his Meridian height</br>Darts kindly down reviving Rays,</br>And one continu'd Splendor crowns our Days.", "This Work, great Poet, was reserv'd for thee,</br>None else cou'd us from our Confinement free:</br>By thee led on, we climb the sacred Hill,</br>And our pleas'd Eyes with distant Prospects fill:</br>View all th' Acquests thy conqu'ring Pen has made,</br>Th' immortall Trophies of thy Fame:</br>And see, as if we stood on Magick Ground,</br>Majestick Ghosts with verdant Laurels crown'd:</br>Illustrious Heroes, ev'ry glorious Name,</br>That can a Place in ancient Records claim:</br>Amongst the rest, thy Virgil's awful Shade,</br>Whom thou hast rais'd to bless our happy Land,</br>Does circl'd round with radiant Honours stand:</br>He's now the welcome Native of our Isle,</br>And crowns our Hopes with an auspicious Smile;</br>With him we wander thro' the depths below,</br>And into Nature's close Recesses go;</br>View all the Secrets of th' Infernal State,</br>And search into the dark Intrigues of Fate:</br>Survey the Pleasures of th' Elesian Fields,</br>And see what Joys the highest Region yields.", "What Thanks, thou gen'rous Man, can we repay,</br>What equal Retributions make,</br>For all thy Pains, and all thy Care,</br>And all those Toils, whose kind Effects we share?</br>Our Language like th' Augean Stable lay,</br>Rude and uncleans'd, till thou by Glory mov'd,</br>Th' Herculean Task didst undertake,</br>And hast with Floods of Wit th' offensive Heaps remov'd:</br>That ancient Rubbish of the Gothick Times,</br>When Manly Sense was lost in trifling Rhimes:</br>Now th' unform'd Mass is to Perfection wrought;</br>Thou hast inlarg'd our Knowledge, and refin'd our Thought.</br>Long mayst thou shine within our British Sphere,</br>And may not Age, nor Care,</br>The sprightly Vigour of thy Mind impair:</br>Let Envy cease, and all thy Merits own,</br>And let our due Regards in Praise be ever shown:</br>And when from hence thou shalt remove</br>To bless th' harmonious World above,</br>May thy strong Genius on our Isle descend,</br>And what it has inspir'd, eternally defend.</br>"]
