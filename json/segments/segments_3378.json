["Hail, happy Sheep!  for in our plains ye feed</br>Secure from every care which us molests;</br>Ye shed no bitter tears,</br>Nor pine with hopeless love;</br>But, in your hearts love follows nature's law;</br>Without his tortures, you partake his sweets;</br>Nor do ye ever rue</br>Ambition's fallen aim;</br>Honours for you have no attractive charms,</br>Nor selfish interest, nor sly deceit:</br>But all these ills, and more,</br>Betide Man's wicked race.</br>Yet, Man possesses reason, which you want!</br>Meek innocents!  here, trust me, loss is gain:</br>For from it small relief</br>By mortals is deriv'd.</br>No!  this fam'd reason, when the passions rage,</br>But ill defends us; wine disturbs her rest;</br>And oft the traitress wounds</br>The heart that sought her aid.</br>Severe, yet impotent, against her foes</br>A fragile shield she raises, insecure;</br>But ye have faithful dogs</br>Against the rage of wolves;</br>And better from these savages they guard,</br>Than from your senses reason.  Lives, like your's,</br>Of sweet forgetfulness,</br>With indolence and ease,</br>Surpass in comforts all the pride of wealth,</br>With birth, and mind, and elegance of form.</br>For, oh!  these shadows yield</br>To your substantial bliss!</br>Incessantly they urge us to do wrong,</br>And sad reflection, in the midst of joy,</br>Dashes the festive cup</br>With gall of dire remorse.</br>The goods of this world Man would make eternal.</br>Dull, stupid fool!  our pleasures, like ourselves,</br>Pass as a summer's breeze,</br>\"Nor leave a wreck behind!\"</br>No sublunary beings suffer more</br>Th' inconstancy of fortune; she decides</br>In every stage of life</br>With unresisted sway.</br>Feed on, then, gentle sheep!  without restraint,</br>Blest in your ignorance, and happier far</br>Than us, who madly boast</br>The epithet of wise!</br>"]
