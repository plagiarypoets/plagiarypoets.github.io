["Where Hudson rolls by Saratoga's plains,</br>How fierce and madly raged the battle's strife!</br>Full many a soldier's corse that glebe contains,</br>But FRASER gave it glory with his life.</br>Beside his mattrass, scarce from danger rife</br>Removed, two kind administ'ring spirits stood&mdash;</br>(Just then a dirge from distant horn and fife)&mdash;</br>And o'er him lean'd the Mohawk from the wood,</br>To see how Christian heroes shed their patriot blood.", "\"Let yonder eminence become my urn&mdash;</br>My humble urn &mdash; at early evening's tide&mdash;</br>One modest pray'r ascends &mdash; your thanks return&mdash;</br>Heaven bless my wife\" &mdash; the hero said, and died.</br>That wife was far across the ocean wide;</br>Nor would he deemed his life too cheaply given,</br>Had she, at this last hour, stood at his side,</br>To soothe his anguished soul in death, or even</br>Renew reiterated vows to meet in Heaven.", "Now sight begins to spread her solemn veil</br>O'er earth, intent to hide the deeds, the day,</br>In bloody league with death hath done; but fail</br>E'en darkest shades to soothe that awful fray.</br>Thou genius of the sable throne!  O say,</br>What clouds uprisen, borne on whirlwinds dire,</br>Quench'd, in their falling floods, the last lone ray</br>That lingered on the hills, but spread in ire,</br>Those flames that gleamed from cylinders of fire.", "O fearful night!  when tempests, leagued with war,</br>Conspire to bind October's chilly brow</br>With darkness, havoc, crime, and deep despair.</br>Oh!  chill the winds from eastern shores that blow;</br>Oh!  fast and deathly cold the torrents flow.</br>But spite of winds, and sleet, and night, and lead</br>In death's employ, with solemn march must go</br>The pious band that bears the glorious dead</br>Forth to his home of rest &mdash; the soldier's honoured bed.", "No useless coffin, in profusion drest,</br>Confined the modest warrior:  but he lay</br>On a rude bier, as soldiers take their rest,</br>Headless of ease; unsheeted was his clay,</br>And for a pall was spread his cloak of gray.</br>Four stalworth warriors lent their General aid,</br>In now the last sad march, the dreary way,</br>To a returnless bourne; for pike and spade</br>Already his retreat in neighbouring mound had made.", "Mournful and slow the sad procession moved,</br>While, from the silver fife and muffled drum,</br>The solemn death-march, as the tide approved,</br>Measured the hero's progress to his home.</br>All silent were they, while their hearts become</br>Still big, and bigger with unbidden grief;</br>Save when the pious chaplain broke the gloom,</br>Between his sobs, with sudden pray'r, and brief,</br>For fortitude of soul, and grace, and kind relief.", "Nor wanting was the full and bold salute&mdash;</br>Just tribute to the brave, the warrior's due&mdash;</br>E'en clamorous war itself paused, still and mute,</br>A little space, O FRASER!  at the view</br>Of its own splendid ruins, and of you.</br>But soon, as roused e'en by thy corse to fear,</br>From foeman's every brazen mouth, there flew</br>Vollies, like Etna's fires, that dinn'd the ear,</br>And swept, with livid glare, athwart thy lowly bier.", "O sad and sickening sight, when even the grave,</br>Sacred no more, becomes the scene of war!</br>As on his bed they stretch'd the humble brave,</br>And, keening at his tomb, the priest, aware</br>Of nothing, save his office, raised his pray'r</br>To Heaven, what thunders broke, like sudden doom,</br>On unsuspecting worlds, with hostile glare,</br>From ordnance, mortar, gun and bursting bomb,</br>Throwing their deathful gleams on night's tremendous gloom.", "But ah!  with thee O FRASER, scenes like these</br>Have lost their wonted power, to swell thy soul,</br>To rouse thy bold and native energies,</br>And fire thy mantling blood beyond control.</br>Thy life's warm current long has ceas'd to roll.</br>And as thy voice once swayed the banner'd host,</br>So now thy death commands unconscious dole,</br>Nor shall thy deeds of valour, wanted most</br>In war, upon admiring thousands e'er be lost.", "What tho' a stranger chaunts thy dirge, e'en one</br>Whose father was thy foe where thou wert slain,</br>What though through many a year time's glass hath run,</br>Since thou wert fell'd upon the bloody plain?</br>A friend to worth prefers the honest strain.</br>Sincere, though late and few, the numbers rise,</br>And when themselves expire, while moons shall wane,</br>Each soldier's heart thy memory dear shall prize,</br>Prepared to hail thy Christian spirit in the skies.</br>"]
