["Holy maid, of modest mien,</br>Who with pensive tread art seen,</br>Distant from the busy throng,</br>Pacing the shady grove along;</br>Or beneath some spreading tree,</br>When the bells sound merrily</br>O'er the vale the village glee;&mdash;</br>Guide my solitary feet</br>To thy peaceful blest retreat,</br>Where the thicket's bushy maze</br>Closes on the hallowed place;</br>By the mountain's hollow side</br>Mocking sound with Echo wide;&mdash;</br>Contemplation!  thou canst give,</br>Sweet delights, that ever live!", "When the joy-inspiring horn</br>Ushers in the early morn,</br>I will climb the high ascent,</br>On meditative thoughts intent.</br>Now the rising god of day</br>Smiles upon the uplands gray;</br>Each genial ray the mist dispels,</br>And by degrees the prospect swells;&mdash;</br>Now a tower, now a tree,</br>Piercing the mizzy shade, I see;</br>Meeds and lawns beneath I view,</br>Flowers all besprent with dew;</br>Beauteous sun and fairy scene,</br>While sweet Aurora breathes between,</br>As wont with Flora fair to play,</br>And spread the fragrant sweets of May,</br>At dawn of Nature's holiday.</br>On the green boughs the feathered throng</br>Charm me with their matin song.</br>How sweet, at dappled morn, to rove,</br>With thee the mountain steep above!", "When upon the western sky</br>Evening opes her purple eye,</br>Lead me to some verdant nook,</br>By the crystal-gliding brook,</br>Murmuring thro' underwood,</br>Which the stream hath long withstood:&mdash;</br>Here, on some embowered seat,</br>I will sit and ruminate;</br>While the milkmaid o'er the lea</br>Is singing blithe and merrily;</br>And to the maiden of the hill</br>The shepherd tunes his wild note shrill.", "Welcome to thee the season blest</br>When tired Nature sinks to rest;</br>When the village din is o'er,&mdash;</br>Flail or cart is heard no more;</br>When the woodman seeks his cot,</br>Contented with his humble lot;</br>When last the swinging wicket creeks,</br>Till the dawn to-morrow breaks;&mdash;</br>Then beside the woodland shade</br>Slowly and unseen I tread,</br>To hear the lonely nightingale</br>Charm the silence of the vale;</br>And behold Night's faint-ey'd queen,</br>Robed in her silver sheen,</br>Peeping thro' clouds that broken fly,</br>Or beaming full in sober sky;</br>Till the knell at solemn hour</br>Bid me rove abroad no more.</br>These delights thou can't bestow</br>In their pure untainted flow!", "Come, Contemplation, holy maid!</br>Lead me to thy lonely shade,</br>Twined with mantling ivy round,</br>Clothed with moss the rural ground,&mdash;</br>Far from Folly's airy train,</br>Or the eye of cold Disdain;</br>Retreat of Solitude and Ease!</br>Shade of balmy-winged Peace!</br>Here I woo with thee to dwell,</br>And taste the pleasures of thy cell!</br>"]
