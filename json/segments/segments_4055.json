["When smiling peace each happy prospect crown'd,</br>When shackled war in sullen bondage lay,</br>When arts and commerce flourish'd all around,</br>Oft has the muse on this returning day,</br>To joys exulting notes, erst tun'd her jocund lay.", "Joys ah!  no more!  revers'd the scene appears;</br>To plaintive measures now she suits the strain,</br>The gladd'ning voice of peace no longer chears,</br>But war terrific clanks his broken chain,</br>Dejected commerce mourns, and drooping arts complain!", "The bark, reluctant, tempts the hostile waves,</br>And quits the shelter of the friendly shore;</br>With doubts perplex'd, the merchant's bosom heaves,</br>Lest some bold foe surprize his freighted store,</br>And hopeless he distrusts, oft e'er to see it more!", "In yonder vale where melancholy's gloom,</br>And want's lorn look excite compassion's sigh,</br>Silent, neglected, stands the artist's loom,</br>On which he frequent casts a wistful eye,</br>And weeps the rueful cause that robs it of employ!", "Hard by, the wretched partner of his care,</br>Assiduous plies the wheel, intent to gain</br>A scant provision for their present fare,</br>While all around their helpless infant train,</br>Urging their little wants, increase the parent's pain!", "O ye, whom Heav'n with affluence hath blest,</br>Let gentle pity in your breasts prevail,</br>Your gen'rous aid extend to the distress'd,</br>A kind, a fav'ring ear lend misery's tale,</br>And in benev'lent acts distinguish now your zeal!", "And you, ye virtuous suff'rers, bear awhile,</br>With patience bear, the clouds will yet blow o'er</br>Of your misfortunes, and benignant smile</br>The bright return of prosp'rous days once more,</br>That to declining trade, new vigour shall restore.", "Then, too, the muse on this returning day,</br>Again with joy shall hail the new-born year,</br>To sprightly notes, attune her laughing lay,</br>Nor longer woe's sad plaints wound pity's list'ning ear.</br>"]
