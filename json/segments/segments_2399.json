["Come hither, my fair child, and let me kiss</br>Thy rosy lips, steep'd in their morning dew;</br>And on thy brightness gazing, taste that bliss</br>A mother feels, when on her raptur'd view</br>Each beauty riper grows; the graceful hue</br>Of health sits blushing on thy tender cheek,</br>And in the azure of thine eye's soft blue</br>Float forms of joy, such as I hope to seek</br>In all thy future days:  a hope how frail and weak!", "Ah, no! &mdash; the current of thy after-years</br>Can never flow so pure as at its spring;</br>But in its silent progress downward, fears</br>Will mingle too, and all their wormwood bring.</br>I trembling think Affliction's deepest sting</br>May pierce thy soul, when she, around whose form</br>Thy little arms in playful fondness cling,</br>Can offer thee no more her bosom warm</br>To solace all thy woes, and shield thee from the storm.", "That rose &mdash; queen of the blooming coronal</br>Of wild flowers waving in thy golden hair&mdash;</br>Behold how soon its robes of damask fall,</br>And cease to shed their perfume on the air,</br>Leaving the parent tendril lone and bare!</br>Alas!  the ills which wait thee in life's scene</br>May in that flower their darken'd emblems bear,</br>When blighted hopes of joy, with pangs unseen,</br>Blanch thy young virgin cheek, and steal its ripen'd sheen!", "My yearning heart in melancholy doom</br>Itself with fancied agony is rending;</br>Let me no longer o'er such frenzies brood,</br>But watch thee, my sweet love, whilst lowly bending,</br>Thou lispeth forth thy morning prayer &mdash; and blending</br>With thy bright upward glance such radiance mild,</br>It seems as if in thee from heav'n descending</br>(Fair Iris of my life!) an angel smil'd,</br>And whisper'd peace, and joy &mdash; Oh!  thou art safe, my child!</br>"]
