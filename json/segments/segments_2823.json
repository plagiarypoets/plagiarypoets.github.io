["Hail!  temp'rate Autumn, Nymph sedate,</br>With russet clad in simple state,</br>Thou claim'st the votive lay;</br>Thy dew the thirsty earth revives,</br>Each drooping plant new strength derives,</br>Nor dreads the scorching ray.", "Though blooming Spring delights no more,</br>And ruddy Summer's charms are o'er,</br>Some beauties grace thy reign;</br>A second Spring adorns thy breast,</br>Some blushing flow'rets deck thy vest,</br>The last in Nature's train.", "Now sheaf-crown'd Ceres leads her throng,</br>Whilst Gratitude inspires their song,</br>To Heav'n's all-bounteous King;</br>Now rural mirth their hours employ,</br>With chearful sounds of guiltless joy</br>The peaceful vallies ring.", "See, rich Pomona next appears,</br>Her choicest wealth the Goddess bears,</br>To crown thy festive board;</br>The Vine her circling arms extends,</br>Beneath her purple burden bends,</br>With luscious nectar stor'd.", "While yet thy golden presents please,</br>Rude Winter's hand unrobes the trees,</br>And ends thy mild domain;</br>And soon the tyrant's piercing storm</br>Shall Nature's beauteous face deform,</br>And desolate the plain.", "Thus flee our days with swiftest pace,</br>Seasons to seasons yield their place,</br>And year to year succeeds;</br>Thus spends vain man his transient life,</br>Immers'd in pleasure, bus'ness, strife,</br>Nor Wisdom's dictates heeds.", "But soon the gay delusion's past,</br>And Time, with Age's wint'ry blast,</br>Each fleeting bliss destroys;</br>Ah!  be it then our ceaseless care</br>To fit th' immortal soul to share</br>In Heav'n's substantial joys.</br>"]
