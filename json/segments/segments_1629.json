["Ye lovely orbs, that in your courses roll,</br>Spangling the firmament with living light,</br>In countless millions spread from pole to pole,</br>And streaming through the shadows of the night,&mdash;</br>How can my ravish'd soul, in love and wonder lost,</br>Enough adore the hand that form'd your glitt'ring host!", "Oft, through the silence of the starlight hour,</br>When other eyes are clos'd in gentle sleep,</br>When I, a stranger to her healing power,</br>O'er the dim lamp my midnight vigils keep;</br>Sick of the gloomy scene, and pale quivering light,</br>That saddens all my soul, and tires my aching sight.", "Softly I steal me to the open air,</br>To breathe awhile the balmy breath of heav'n,</br>Look round that world, supported by his care,</br>And all the various blessings widely given.</br>Rapt with the glorious view, my soul essays</br>Hosannas to his name, his mighty name to raise!</br>"]
