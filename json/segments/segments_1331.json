["Heroic worth, O Burke, implies a mind</br>Fearless and firm, laborious, kind, and just,</br>But in a deedless prison is confin'd,</br>Nor is accomplish'd to fulfil its trust,</br>Where (Understanding's higher pow'rs deny'd)</br>It sleeps a stagnant lake depriv'd of wind and tide.", "When these perfections are combin'd, we see</br>The godlike friend of nations, Time,</br>Enrich'd with genial lustre, rise like thee,</br>Till up to Glory's noon his radiance climb,</br>Far o'er the earth salute the raptur'd sight,</br>And yield its goodliest fruits the largess of his light.", "Tho' Dulness blink, and shun the glorious blaze</br>Which Envy's hazy veil would hide from view,</br>Its Heav'n-born force but wider shoots its rays,</br>Exults its healing journey to pursue,</br>The more obstructed struggles more to shine,</br>Nor yields to Hell-born Hate its destiny divine.", "'Tis thine to know, 'tis often thine to feel</br>How Virtue lifts thee, Burke, above despite,</br>Guards the great guardian of the public weal,</br>Nor grants the rage of foes thy fame to blight,</br>When o'er life's wild thy Virtue's march they blame,</br>Still clouded from their view, tho' lit by Heav'n's own flame.</br>"]
