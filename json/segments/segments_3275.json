["Shall poets dignify my walks and bowers,</br>Cowley forgot?  forbid it, rural powers!</br>Ye rural powers, your choicest treasures shed,</br>To form a garland for your Cowley's head:</br>Collect the radiance of the showery bow,</br>The rose's scarlet, and the lilly's snow,</br>To emulate his works, confus'dly bright,</br>Where glories rise on glories, light on light,</br>The prism of wit!  Apollo, once before,</br>So gilded Donn, but so could gild no more.</br>Our moderns flow, 'tis true, in easy rhimes;</br>But will our moderns flow thro' future times?</br>Warm distant ages with their glorious fire,</br>Inspir'd themselves, and potent to inspire?</br>Cowley, this praise is thine! &mdash; an age is past,</br>Yet still you charm the present and the last:</br>Your thoughts, your verse, their pristine lustre hold,</br>Like rows of jewels rang'd on cloth of gold:</br>Aeneas' passport thus, the golden bough,</br>Solid and bright at once, resembles you;</br>Like that, you lead us to Elysium too.</br>No muddy streams of dull pollution run</br>In your chaste lines; each wanton hint you shun,</br>Save when a transient Venus blots the sun.</br>You sung each flower that spreads the vivid hue,</br>Each healing plant that sips the silver dew,</br>Each tree that decks the garden, or the grove;</br>You sung, but never felt, the fires of Love:</br>For Love too witty, and from passion free,</br>You had the mistress, but no lover, she:</br>Goaded with points, Love never wept so sore,</br>Tho' wounded by a Muse's bee before.", "O master of the many-chorded lyre,</br>Whom all the Nine, with all their gifts, inspire!</br>Next Spenser's bower, accept this humble shed,</br>He charm'd you living, and you join him dead.</br>But far I place thee from coy Daphne's tree;</br>The tree that hates Apollo, loves not thee:</br>Yet had Apollo sung so well, the maid</br>Had yielded, nor been turn'd into a shade.</br>"]
