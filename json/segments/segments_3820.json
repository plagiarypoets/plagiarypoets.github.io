["Farewell, my feeble harp! &mdash; now rest awhile&mdash;</br>Perchance for ever &mdash; ne'er again to ring!&mdash;</br>Unless (blest thought!) some sweet benignant smile</br>Of fav'ring Fortune shall \"awake thy string,\"</br>And to my pow'rless hand new spirit bring&mdash;</br>But grant it so &mdash; yet should thy judges frown,</br>And thy poor lays to dark oblivion fling&mdash;</br>Then thou, my harp, must lie for ever down,</br>And moulder on the sward, amid some forest brown.", "And to the solemn sentence I shall bow</br>In silence meek, nor e'er shall I repine&mdash;</br>Unnumber'd lays must to oblivion go,</br>Of which the race to come shall hear no line!&mdash;</br>For not round every brow the lay shall twine;</br>Its wreath unfading only crowns the few,</br>Within whose favour'd breasts the fire divine</br>Burns strong, and glows with warmth for ever new;</br>And when their bones are dust, Fame does with their shades pursue.&mdash;", "Whate'er thy doom &mdash; lov'd harp!  I not regret</br>The little moments I have struck thy wire&mdash;</br>For oft to banish woe, with thee I've sat,</br>And milder thoughts thy tones did aye inspire;&mdash;</br>Tho' not at all times when I might desire,</br>Thy sounds, tho' weak at best, would deign to swell&mdash;</br>And oft I've blam'd thee for a cruel lyre,</br>That could to woe refuse thy lulling spell.&mdash;</br>Now let us part as friends &mdash; poor, feeble harp, farewell!&mdash;</br>"]
