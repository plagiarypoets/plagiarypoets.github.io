["A voice of wailing heard and loud lament</br>From Sinai's rocks to fruitful Lebanon&mdash;</br>The awful warning of destruction sent</br>To Nineveh the great, and Babylon&mdash;</br>Ruin, and utter desolation;</br>Thence to all nations, in the dark eclipse</br>Floundering and sinking, of religion's sun,</br>Denounced tremendous by the hallow'd lips</br>Of him, the inspired bard that wrote the Apocalypse.", "Behold my First.  My Second lies conceal'd</br>In words impervious to the noon-tide beam</br>Where erst the mighty prophet who reveal'd</br>The monarch of Assyria's mystic dream,</br>And thence, borne onward by the viewless stream</br>Of unborn ages, to the searching eye</br>Of Faith has given its widest, amplest theme,</br>Was doom'd in youth by tyrant power to lie</br>A prey to fiercest beasts, who growl'd and pass'd him by.", "&mdash;Both grandly dark &mdash; Behold yet darker frown</br>Through the thick gloom of ages past away,</br>Wearing the semblance of a kingly crown,</br>With streaming beard, and locks of iron gray;</br>Grim-visaged potentate, whose bloody sway</br>Crimsons the eternal snows that gird the pole;</br>Whose name yet lives remember'd in the day</br>When low in dust repentant bigots roll&mdash;</br>Low, and with ashes soil'd &mdash; behold!  you have my whole.</br>"]
