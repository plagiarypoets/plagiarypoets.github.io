["Accept, O CHATTERTON, too late, the wreath</br>Which will not flourish upon Rowley's tomb;</br>Born ere our rugged language glow'd beneath</br>The mellowing touch of Time, and caught the bloom</br>Of polish'd Diction; born ere Numbers sweet</br>Measur'd the varied round, in Harmony complete:", "And ere to philosophic rule allied,</br>Our poesy the vague ideas taught</br>To know their rank:  ere yet inventive pride</br>Burst the dark prison of the fetter'd thought.</br>Accept, ill-fated youth, to grace thy name,</br>The just, the dear-bought guerdon of disastrous fame!", "Rich, flowery, nervous, plaintive, gay, sublime;</br>In sentiment and manners deeply skill'd!&mdash;</br>Had but our earlier ages learn'd to climb</br>Those heights, and that wide maze of knowledge fill'd,</br>Which to thy infant genius Fate display'd,</br>Thy artful mimic theft had not itself betray'd!", "But now, though antique gloom incrust the pile</br>Wrought by thy hands, still beams through the disguise</br>Th' internal symmetry, and mocks the toil</br>Which offer'd motley ruins to our eyes.</br>Thy genius, form'd to polish and create,</br>Soar'd far beyond the times it strove to imitate.", "Take then, O CHATTERTON, the bootless praise,</br>Which cannot vibrate on thy death-struck ear!</br>And O!  if ever in remotest days</br>A youth like thee shall taste the vital air,</br>O may he learn, from thy misfortunes known,</br>In conscious merit proud, the work he forms to own!</br>"]
