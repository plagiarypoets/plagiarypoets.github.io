["Deep in a dark recess, where waters black</br>In current listless move, there dwells Despair,</br>Her wings all pond'rous, and each motion slack;</br>Her bosom dank, heaving with stagnant air:", "Affright and horrour shake her palsey'd mind,</br>Her hope forlorn, if hope that may be called,</br>Which, good in expectation none can find,</br>And at each future prospect is appalled.", "Her guests no comfort know, but ever feed</br>On tainted viands, tainted all with grief;</br>With anguish fell, the sad but frequent meed</br>Of Virtue perished beyond relief.", "Then come not near this desolated cell,</br>Let Innocence and Virtue be thy stay;</br>Let Hope's bright glowing ray all gloom dispel,</br>That Hope whose bounds are unremitting day.</br>"]
