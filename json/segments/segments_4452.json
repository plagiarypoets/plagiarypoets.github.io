["How mem'ry loves to dwell upon the light</br>Of suns beneath Fame's wide horizon set,</br>And steal, amid the thickly coming night,</br>A few bright glances that are ling'ring yet:</br>Rays glistening doubly through the deep'ning jet,</br>Whose blight must close man's evanescent course!</br>And kindle up the feeling of regret;</br>That such should ever lose their pristine force,</br>Or death arrest in them, life's frail unsteady source.", "There are, and have been, who in this dull scene,</br>Seem'd but as beings of another air,</br>Spirits of heavenly mould, in mortal sheen,</br>Whose mental brightness shames the garb they wear:</br>Who, like the couchant lion in his lair,</br>Disdain'd to show their hidden mightiness,</br>Yet could not all restrain the feeling there,</br>Whose latent touch had more than power to bless,</br>And seldom cared to show its dazzling loveliness.", "There are too, those, born only to reflect</br>Such splendour round with more ethereal beam,</br>Dark souls of envy, anxious to detect</br>Some spring, whose flow may sully o'er the stream</br>And dim the beauty of its purer gleam:</br>Yet as the mist before a summer sun,</br>They vanish like the flitting of a dream,</br>And only show the radiance of that One,</br>More bright for the frail cloud of Hate through which it shone.", "Byron!  could not thy muse arrest the shaft,</br>Which Envy's minions vainly dared to throw,</br>Hirelings of bigotry, and bigot's craft,</br>Whose souls were narrow as their fame was low;</br>The dregs of Earth, the weeds whose labours grow,</br>To stagnate in corruption; could not thine</br>Have silenced calumny's inveterate flow,</br>And forced her crew to homage genius' line,</br>When all that Earth could reach, were given thee of the Nine", "Alas!  not even Fate can stay the arm,</br>That Envy lifts against the sons of fame,</br>Nor shield the purest from the slanderer's harm,</br>When Hate is leagued against a mighty name:</br>It ever will be, and hath been the same&mdash;</br>For petty fools must feed their useless ire,</br>And though a god, drank of the eternal flame,</br>Still would the tongue of hate, decry his lyre,</br>And strive with vain attempts, to quench the rising fire.", "Yet thou may'st look on these complacently,</br>With pitying soul, and less thou scornful smile</br>Till their own malice, leave its work to die,</br>And their dark actions shame their ready wile:</br>Thy name will shine more brightly for their guile;</br>Thy faith will show more purely than their zeal;</br>And 'mid the many errors that defile,</br>The foes of thy bright fame, each soul will feel</br>How holy is the fane, where thine was wont to kneel.", "Around thy works a fiery halo plays,</br>Wrapping the soul in awe:  whilst terrors spread</br>Their mantle o'er the fierce effulgent blaze,</br>That circles in thy more than magic tread.</br>We deem thee something from the mighty dead,</br>New risen, full of majesty an power,</br>And by the charm of those high feelings led</br>Wander, with minds entranc'd, the flitting hour</br>Slaves to those thoughts in thee, which o'er all weakness tower.", "And if thy lofty soul disdain'd to crouch</br>Beneath the censure of the despot crowd,</br>Whose bane is gender'd in their mould'ring touch,</br>And reputation in their praise bestow'd:</br>We love thee more, because thou hast not bow'd;</br>'Twas not with them to crush thy glorious wing,</br>That hath so many heavenly regions plough'd:</br>Nor is it in their hostile power to bring</br>One hue to mar the light of thy imagining.", "Peace then to thee and thine, immortal shade,</br>That peace which thou hast left with us below;</br>For round the muse was never charm array'd,</br>More bright than that, which crowns thy offering now,</br>Nor holier than the light around thy brow;</br>Though thy own feather plum'd detraction's dart,</br>Its rankling venom long hath ceased to grow,</br>But banish'd by the magic of thy art,</br>Its scar hath left thy fame more lasting for the smart.</br>"]
