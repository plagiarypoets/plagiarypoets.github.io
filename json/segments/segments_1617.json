["Fam'd Erin's harp, too long hast thou been laid,</br>In songless silence, 'mid ruin'd Tara's walls;</br>Too long, alas!  have thy witch-notes been staid;</br>Notes that erst sounded high amid those halls,</br>Where desolation now, and ruin appals,</br>And nought reminds us of thy ancient song,</br>Except when Fancy some chance-cadence calls,</br>Whilst kindred sympathies the strains prolong,</br>And paint thee to the ear in numbers smooth and strong!", "What, though with feeble powers I thee invoke,</br>And o'er thy chords a languid finger fling;</br>What though no poet's fire inspire each stroke,</br>Nor minstrel rapture brush thee with its wing:</br>Yet still, once more, I'd gladly hear thee sing</br>Some wild song of thy ancient minstrelsy,</br>Once more, with rapture, hear thy peerless string</br>Proclaim the matchless powers long lost in thee,</br>And pour in melting strains thy heavenly melody.", "Oft, oft hast thou, in numbers wild and bold,</br>To noble daring roused brave Erin's throng,</br>And while you fired the young, inspired the old,</br>Or melted the rapt soul with Pity's song;</br>Or, 'mid sweet raptures, often didst prolong</br>The musings of some maid enchain'd in love,</br>Whose wilder'd fingers stray'd thy chords among,</br>Which while to fix on thee she vainly strove,</br>She look'd like one inspir'd with thoughts all fix'd above!", "Whilst mouldering damps, for many woeful years,</br>And rusts corroding round thy chords have clung,</br>Oft down some aged minstrel's cheek the tears</br>Have stolen, as of thee he hopeless sung:</br>His country's sorrows yet, and woes among,</br>Would fancy paint thee to his soul again,</br>And on the future, as he musing hung,</br>Prophetic would describe some future strain,</br>And swear thy long lost notes had not yet slept in vain!</br>"]
