["What beauties does Nature disclose</br>When array'd in the charms of sweet May?</br>What melody flows from the grove?</br>What tints does sweet Flora display?</br>The bleating hills glisten with gold,</br>Declaring bright Phoebus is nigh;</br>The zephyrs their secrets unfold,</br>As they whisper the Virgin's reply.&mdash;", "Oh!  could I prevail with my love,</br>I'd persuade her with me to retire;</br>Where I've form'd for the nymph an alcove</br>Of the woodbine, the jessamine, briar:</br>The linnet has built its nest there,</br>In hopes to be pleasing to her:</br>And the dove sings my passion &mdash; Despair,</br>As he cooes from a neighb'ring fir.", "No pleasure the great city yields,</br>That can't be excell'd in my groves,</br>What pleasure is like to my fields?</br>What harmony like to my doves?</br>Not a thorn but is powder'd all o'er,</br>Not a flow'r but is found in my mead,</br>Not a field but has plentiful store,</br>Nor a tree but in beauty array'd.", "No palace can vie in my mind,</br>With my wheat'n thatch'd cottage of clay;</br>No monarch on earth will you find</br>Can say, he is happy one day;</br>No luxuries poison my board,</br>Nor wines from Constantia I buy;</br>My little I never do hoard,</br>For I always find poorer than I.", "What rout can produce such a sight?</br>What pastime or mirth have you seen?</br>(When the villagers meet ev'ry night,)</br>To equal their dance on the green:</br>Health gay in his russet attire,</br>His fair one selects from the ring,</br>And Innocence blushes t' admire,</br>The heart she is eager to win.", "Soft transports of bliss I shall find,</br>If Mary will hither repair;</br>A garland of roses I'll bind,</br>To present as a gift to my fair;</br>If she should but chance to approve,</br>And wear but the chaplet I've made,</br>I'll live on the smiles of my love,</br>And deem myself more than repaid.</br>"]
