["Cease, cease, my dear friend, to explore</br>From whence, and how piercing my smart;</br>Let the charms of the nymph I adore,</br>Excuse, and interpret my heart:</br>Then how much I admire, you shall prove,</br>When like me you are taught to admire;</br>And imagine how boundless my love,</br>When you number the charms that inspire.", "Than sunshine more dear to my sight,</br>To my life more essential than air,</br>To my soul she is perfect delight,</br>To my sense all that's pleasing and fair.</br>The swains who her beauty behold,</br>With transport applaud ev'ry charm,</br>And swear that the breast must be cold,</br>Which a beam so intense cannot warm.", "Ah!  say, will she slightly forego</br>A conquest, though humble, yet sure?</br>Will she leave a poor shepherd to wo,</br>Who for her ev'ry bliss would procure?</br>Alas!  too presaging my fears,</br>Too jealous my soul of its bliss;</br>Methinks she already appears,</br>To foresee, and elude my address.", "Does my boldness offend my dear maid?</br>Is my fondness loquacious and free?</br>Are my visits too frequently paid;</br>Or my converse unworthy of thee?</br>Yet when grief was too big for my breast,</br>And labour'd in sighs to complain,</br>Its struggles I oft have supprest,</br>And silence impos'd on my pain.", "And oft, while, by tenderness caught,</br>To my charmer's retirement I flew,</br>I reproach'd the fond absence of thought,</br>And in blushing confusion withdrew.</br>My speech, though too little refin'd,</br>Though simple and aukward my mien;</br>Yet still, shouldst thou deign to be kind,</br>What a wonderful change might be seen!", "Ah, Strephon!  how vain thy desire,</br>Thy numbers and music how vain,</br>While merit and fortune conspire</br>The smiles of the nymph to obtain?</br>Yet cease to upbraid the soft choice,</br>Though it ne'er should determine for thee,</br>If thy heart in her joy may rejoice,</br>Unhappy thou never canst be.</br>"]
