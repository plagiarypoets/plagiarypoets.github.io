["How could you deceive me, my fair?</br>How tell me you openness lov'd?</br>How persuade me my sad pensive air</br>Was by you not disdain'd, but approv'd?</br>And yet the delusion had pow'r</br>For to charm my whole senses away;</br>I gaz'd on you hour after hour,</br>And to please fram'd the rude rural lay.", "While my soul as all melted in love,</br>While each nerve and each pulse wildly beat,</br>You a passion as strong seem'd to move;</br>Who e'er could have dream'd 'twas deceit?</br>When I fault'ring attempted to speak,</br>My confusion was cur'd with a smile,</br>You strove my fond silence to break;</br>Yet this was all meant to beguile.", "How oft have we carelessly stray'd,</br>While the moon feebly lighted the vale,</br>And under the soft amorous shade,</br>Prolong'd the soft amorous tale?</br>Then the wind could not shake the light leaf,</br>Nor the river roll loudly along,</br>Nor the nightingale breathe out her grief,</br>But you fearfully clasp'd me more strong.", "Those days are still fresh in my view,</br>When I search'd where the violet blows,</br>And tore from the spot where it grew,</br>The briar, or wild-spreading rose:</br>You was pleas'd with the trifles I cull'd,</br>And urg'd to repeat the fond task,</br>And still, though I frequently pull'd,</br>You, frequent delighted, would ask.", "Now far other transports are mine,</br>Far other employments I find;</br>No more I your garland entwine,</br>You oft have refus'd it, unkind:</br>Each moment I pour forth my fears,</br>Tales of wo to the woods I impart,</br>Which, though oft interrupted by tears,</br>Ye mournfully sooth my sad heart.", "Now I see that Unfaithfulness reigns,</br>That a fond constant nymph is a dream;</br>Deceit is found roving the plains,</br>And winding along ev'ry stream:</br>Of the change, ah, ye shepherds, beware,</br>Nor trust the allurements of art;</br>Believe not the false smiling air,</br>Since the tongue's not allied to the heart!", "Farewell to the flocks I have fed!</br>Farewell to the flow'rs I have rear'd!</br>Farewell to the sweet-breathing mead,</br>Where so often with you I've appear'd!</br>I fly, yet I love you, my fair;</br>Perhaps you'll repent when I'm gone;</br>My bosom shall nourish despair,</br>And I'll sigh that all pleasure is flown.</br>"]
