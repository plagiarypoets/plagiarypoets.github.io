["Once more my flowery wreaths I must forsake,</br>For mournful cypress, pensive myrtles take,</br>And creeping ivy for the sprightly bays,</br>Once more to strains of woe attune my lays;</br>And O, divinest nymph, fair Arethuse,</br>(If still propitious to the mourning muse,</br>If bitter Doris still retains her place</br>Nor stains thy waters in a forc'd embrace,</br>Filling thy breast with sorrows all thy own)</br>Vouchsafe thy wonted aid; the muses son,</br>Their fav'rite GRAY I mourn, the gentle youth,</br>For piety rever'd, for sacred truth,</br>Lov'd by them all, and cherish'd from his birth,</br>\"Now rests his head upon the lap of earth;\"</br>He mourn'd himself when merit was distress'd,</br>When virtue and when goodness were oppress'd:", "Haste shepherds, haste, to greet his ashes bring</br>The first fair honors of the breathing spring;</br>Whatever earth from her free bosom pours,</br>All that on groves and gardens Flora showers</br>With copious hand, all verdant shrubs that bear</br>Perpetual sweets, and flourish thro' the year:</br>Strew sweets before his hearse, whilst o'er the plains</br>The sad procession moves to mournful strains:</br>And art thou gone lov'd youth, the shepherds cry&mdash;</br>Lov'd youth, the virgins all in tears reply;</br>Old age, with sighs relates his blameless life,</br>His manners, gentle, pure, and free from strife:", "The race of wretched scribblers, they alone,</br>With envy stung, rejoice that thou art gone;</br>What now shall hinder them with flashy rhimes,</br>To strain their tuneless throats, with uncouth chimes,</br>And senseless jargon grate upon the ear,</br>And publish daily follies thro' the year?", "But sure, if piety deserves regard,</br>Thy shade below shall meet its due reward,</br>And far divided from th' ignoble croud,</br>Resort with spirits of the just and good;</br>There rove at large amidst the blest abodes,</br>Where poets crown'd with everliving bays</br>Reside with heroes that inspir'd their lays,</br>And patriots rest in virtue's inmost bower</br>Who sunk beneath the stroke of tyrant power:</br>To these, one common group, thou may'st rehearse</br>The lofty cadence of the sounding verse;</br>Again huge Snowdon nods his haughty brow,</br>And foams old Conway's angry flood below,</br>Whilst purple tyranny stands all aghast,</br>And impious nations shiver in the blast;</br>But if in soothing elegiac strains,</br>In plaintive notes thy mournful muse complains,</br>Such as the bird of night from ev'nings close</br>Repeats amid the woods with thrilling woes,</br>The bending ghosts with fixt attention hear,</br>And shades of mightiest heroes drop a tear,</br>E'en grisly Pluto and his bride admire,</br>And Orpheus leans upon his golden lyre.", "Such honors are for thee; to us remain,</br>Continued sorrows and whole years of pain;</br>Our first sad task, to give thy ashes rest,</br>And bid the turf lye light upon thy breast.</br>"]
