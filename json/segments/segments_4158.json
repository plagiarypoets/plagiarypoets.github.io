["A Bard from the MERSEY is gone,</br>Whose carols with energy flow'd;</br>Whose harp had a wildness of tone,</br>And a sweetness but rarely bestow'd.</br>Then say &mdash; ye dispensers of fame,</br>Of wreathes that for ages will bloom,</br>Ah!  say, shall poor MULLIGAN'S name,</br>Go silently down to the tomb?", "When the lordly are call'd from their state,</br>The marble their virtue imparts,</br>Yet the marble, ye insolent great,</br>Is often less cold than your hearts.</br>When the life of the warrior is o'er,</br>His deeds every tongue shall rehearse.</br>And now a pale Bard is no more,</br>Ah!  would you deny him a verse!", "The thrush from the icicl'd bough,</br>Gives his song to the winterly gale,</br>And the violet, 'midst half melted snow,</br>Diffuses its sweets thro' the vale.</br>And thus, while the minstrel I mourn</br>'Mid the blasts of adversity pin'd,</br>While he droop'd all obscure and forlorn,</br>He pour'd his wild sweets on the wind.", "Tho' the clouds that had sadden'd his days,</br>Were scatter'd and ting'd near the close;</br>Tho' he saw a few comforting rays,</br>Twas too late, and he sunk to repose.</br>So the bark, that fierce winds has endur'd,</br>And the shocks of the pityless wave,</br>Finds a harbour, yet scarcely is moor'd,</br>When she sinks to the dark oozy grave.", "To the turf where poor MULLIGAN lies,</br>The lover of genius shall stray,</br>And there should a rank weed arise,</br>He shall pluck the intruder away.</br>But lowly, and simple, and sweet,</br>Ah!  should the wild violet appear,</br>He will sigh o'er an emblem so meet,</br>And will water its cup with a tear.</br>"]
