["While silent ages glide away,</br>And turrets tremble with decay,</br>Let not the pensive Muse disdain</br>The tribute of one humble strain,</br>To mourn in plaints of pity due</br>The fate of yonder blasted YEW.", "Long blotted from the rolls of time</br>The day that mark'd thy early prime,</br>No hoary sage remains to say</br>Who kindly rear'd thy tender spray;</br>Who taught its slow-maturing form</br>From age to age to brave the storm.", "Beneath thy widely branching shade</br>Perchance his weary limbs were laid,</br>Content, without a stone &mdash; to share</br>The umbrage of thy grateful care;</br>His utmost wish for thee to shed</br>Oblivion's dews around his head.", "And long thy darkling foliage gave</br>A hallowed stillness to his grave;</br>For there &mdash; if legends rightly tell,</br>No vagrant reptile dar'd to dwell:</br>Even sprights, by moonlight wont to stray,</br>Scar'd at thy presence fled away.", "As thus, in contemplative mood</br>The venerable trunk I view'd,</br>Forth issuing from the sapless rind</br>A hoarse voice trembled on the wind.</br>Amaz'd I stood:  and wing'd with fear</br>These accents caught my wondering ear.", "\"Me to the precincts of the place,</br>That antique hallowed Pile to grace,</br>From native woods, in days of yore,</br>The fathers of the hamlet bore:</br>Foster'd by Superstition's hand,</br>A late memorial now I stand.", "\"My spreading shade extending wide,</br>The village wonder, and its pride,</br>I mark'd as years revolv'd, the blow</br>That laid thy hardiest grandsires low.</br>Now, worn with all-consuming age,</br>I yield to Time's relentless rage.", "\"Nor fondly blame, with strain severe,</br>The simple zeal that plac'd me here;</br>Nor dare thy fathers to despise,</br>And deem their upstart sons more wise:</br>Let self-conviction check thy pride</br>To error both too near allied.", "\"Of zeal's unletter'd warmth possest,</br>Yet still, Religion fir'd their breast;</br>Frequent the hallowed court to tread,</br>Where Mercy hears Repentance plead;</br>Constant the grateful hymn to raise.</br>Our Zion echoed with their praise.", "\"Their sons superior knowledge boast!</br>Knowledge how vain!  since zeal is lost.</br>Now gradual, as my branches pine,</br>I see Devotion's flame decline.</br>And while, like me, RELIGION wanes,</br>Alas!  her vestige scarce remains.\"</br>"]
