["'Twas when the sun had from the skies withdrawn,</br>With softer light the moon resplendent shone;</br>Thro' the tall forest's close embow'ring height,</br>Her gliding crescent shed uncertain light,</br>While pensive William held his dubious way,</br>Alone, conducted by her flitting ray;</br>Swift thro' the trees the hast'ning shepherd hy'd,</br>To meet his love, his long-intended bride.</br>Full forty furlongs o'er his heathy moor</br>The swain must travel ere he reach her door;</br>That length of journey still did William find,</br>When he had left the gloomy wood behind.", "Now vap'ry clouds obscur'd the silver moon,</br>Which thro' the floating veil but faintly shone;</br>And now quick trav'ling o'er the dreary waste,</br>The swain enamour'd half his toil had past,</br>When lo!  an envious meteor's errant light</br>Deceitful shines, and cheats his eager sight.</br>\"Yonder's the cottage,\" to himself he cries,</br>Where Mary's charms shall greet my longing eyes;</br>There shall my toil a blissful solace find,</br>In talk with her, so pleasing and so kind.</br>Lovely she is, so witty and so gay;</br>With her how swift the moments steal away!</br>So sweet she looks, whate'er she does or says,</br>I could for ever hear, for ever gaze!</br>Care-worn, no more with wakeful love I'll pine,</br>When spring returns, I'll make the charmer mine.</br>I cannot think she would my proffer slight;</br>She surely would not, if I judge aright.</br>As once I urg'd my suit, and warmly prest,</br>('Twas when reclining on her heaving breast)</br>I told her, would she but consent to join</br>The hand I held in marriage bond with mine,</br>No peasant low, nor splendid prince so high,</br>Could taste such joys, or be so blest as I;</br>She blush'd, and silent drew her hand away;</br>She said not yes &mdash; but yet she said not nay.</br>Her blushing cheek, her speaking eye, confest</br>That I, at least, her kind esteem possest.</br>So sweet she looks, whate'er she does or says,</br>I could for ever hear, for ever gaze!</br>O!  when she's mine, then with the lark I'll rise,</br>Soon as the sun-beams paint the eastern skies;</br>To fetch the kine I'll cross the dewy plain,</br>Assist to milk, and drive to field again:</br>When summer comes we'll toil the live-long day;</br>I'll sow the grass, and she shall make the hay:</br>When harvest waves mature along the field,</br>Together we'll our crooked sickles wield:</br>Pleas'd will we lay the weighty sheaves along,</br>And soothe our labour with a sprightly song.</br>How gaily should I ply the whistling flail,</br>To thresh that corn she'd winnow in the gale;</br>While loaves or cakes, prepar'd by hand so neat,</br>To me would taste with relish doubly sweet.</br>So sweet she looks, whate'er she does or says,</br>I could for ever hear, for ever gaze!\"", "With strains like these the swain beguil'd his care,</br>Of fraud mistrustless, or not well aware;</br>And as the rude spontaneous numbers flow'd,</br>The quick succession cheats the tedious road:</br>Heedless he runs to gain the faithless light,</br>Nor aught suspects, or weens himself not right.</br>He fondly hoping soon the cot to gain,</br>Misguided wanders o'er the trackless plain.</br>At length, when long he'd roam'd the wide-spread waste,</br>And far beyond the wish'd-for cottage past,</br>Sudden from sight the sportive flame withdrew!</br>He stopt amaz'd, and wist not what to do;</br>Then strait emerging shone a radiant beam,</br>And, trembling, quiver'd on a purling stream</br>That cross'd his path &mdash; confounded stood the swain,</br>And sunk exhausted on the heathy plain.</br>No purling stream had cross'd his path before,</br>Nor could he guess what ground he'd travell'd o'er;</br>Yet stung with rage, impatient of delay,</br>He rose, and backward trod his devious way.</br>Here fortune prov'd to wilder'd William kind,</br>(Dame Fortune's acts are ever vague and blind)</br>She led his steps thro' bogs and bushy dells,</br>Straight to the cottage where his Mary dwells.</br>She waiting sat, (nor reck'd the midnight hour)</br>For William's promis'd coming o'er the moor,</br>The wearied swain his sad mischance relates,</br>His toilsome wand'rings, and vexatious straits:</br>She laugh'd to hear, then gave a tender smile;</br>Glad William saw, nor rued his former toil.</br>"]
