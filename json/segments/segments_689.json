["Fair morn ascends:  soft zephyr's wing</br>O'er hill and vale renews the spring:</br>Where, sown profusely, herb and flower,</br>Of balmy smell, of healing power,</br>Their souls in fragrant dews exhale,</br>And breathe fresh life in every gale.</br>Here, spreads a green expanse of plains,</br>Where, sweetly-pensive, Silence reigns;</br>And there, at utmost stretch of eye,</br>A mountain fades into the sky;</br>While winding round, diffus'd and deep,</br>A river rowls with sounding sweep.</br>Of human art no traces near,</br>I seem alone with Nature here!", "Here are thy walks, O sacred HEALTH!</br>The monarch's bliss, the beggar's wealth!</br>The seasoning of all good below!</br>The sovereign friend in joy or woe!</br>O thou, most courted, most despis'd,</br>And but in absence duly priz'd!</br>Power of the soft and rosy face!</br>The vivid pulse, the vermil grace,</br>The spirits when they gayest shine,</br>Youth, beauty, pleasure, all are thine!</br>O sun of life!  whose heavenly ray</br>Lights up, and chears, our various day,</br>The turbulence of hopes and fears,</br>The storm of fate, the cloud of years,</br>Till Nature, with thy parting light,</br>Reposes late in Death's calm night:</br>Fled from the trophy'd roofs of state,</br>Abodes of splendid pain, and hate;</br>Fled from the couch, where, in sweet sleep,</br>Hot Riot would his anguish steep,</br>But tosses thro the midnight-shade,</br>Of death, of life, alike afraid;</br>For ever fled to shady cell,</br>Where Temperance, where the Muses dwell;</br>Thou art seen, at early dawn,</br>Slow-pacing o'er the breezy lawn:</br>Or on the brow of mountain high,</br>In silence feasting ear and eye,</br>With song and prospect, which abound</br>From birds, and woods, and waters round.", "But when the sun, with noontide ray,</br>Flames forth intolerable day;</br>While Heat sits fervent on the plain,</br>With Thirst and Languor in his train;</br>All nature sickening in the blaze:</br>Thou, in the wild and woody maze,</br>That clouds the vale with umbrage deep,</br>Impendent from the neighbouring steep,</br>Wilt find betimes a calm retreat,</br>Where breathing Coolness has her seat.", "There, plung'd amid the shadows brown,</br>Imagination lays him down;</br>Attentive, in his airy mood,</br>To very murmur of the wood:</br>The bee in yonder flowry nook;</br>The chidings of the headlong brook;</br>The green leaf shivering in the gale;</br>The warbling hill, the lowing vale;</br>The distant woodman's echoing stroke;</br>The thunder of the falling oak.</br>From thought to thought in vision led,</br>He holds high converse with the Dead;</br>Sages, or Poets.  See they rise!</br>And shadowy skim before his eyes.</br>Hark!  ORPHEUS strikes the lyre again,</br>The soften'd savages to men:</br>Lo!  SOCRATES, the Sent of heaven,</br>To whom it's moral will was given.</br>Fathers and friends of human kind,</br>They form'd the nations or refin'd,</br>With all that mends the head and heart,</br>Enlightening truth, adorning art.", "While thus I mus'd beneath the shade,</br>At once the sounding breeze was laid:</br>And Nature, by the unknown law,</br>Shook deep with reverential awe.</br>Dumb silence grew upon the hour;</br>A browner night involv'd the bower:</br>When issuing from the inmost wood,</br>Appear'd fair Freedom's GENIUS good.</br>O Freedom!  sovereign boon of heaven;</br>Great Charter, with our being given;</br>For which the patriot, and the sage,</br>Have plan'd, have bled thro every age!</br>High privilege of human race,</br>Beyond a mortal monarch's grace:</br>Who could not give, nor can reclaim,</br>What but from God immediate came!</br>"]
