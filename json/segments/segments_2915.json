["Thief of my Rhymes!  O more unpitying Thief</br>Than ever plunder'd from the poor Man's Store,</br>Robb'd the pale Widow in the hour of Grief,</br>Or from its Hand the Orphan's Pittance tore!</br>O Theft of deeper Dye than that of yore,</br>When Phoebus, by the Charm of Beauty led,</br>Like some poor Swain, Admetus' Cattle fed,</br>And he, the God of many Mischiefs, bore</br>His Songs, his Flocks, his Flute, from fair Thessalia's Shore.", "Yet, hadst thou, all rapacious as thou art,</br>Known the long Travel that thy Bard sustain'd,</br>To bear these simple Children of his Heart;</br>How oft from youthful Pastime he refrain'd,</br>Some thought of Pity had, perchance, remain'd,</br>And left them in these lonely Shades, to chear</br>His pensive Moments, when December drear,</br>The Thief of Nature, all her Aspect stain'd</br>With one unvary'd Gloom, and one dull Horror reign'd.", "Thief of my Rhymes!  O worse than other Thieves!</br>They take the paltry Goods that Fortune brought,</br>But this the Soul a rifled Pilgrim leaves,</br>And robs her of her little Hoard of Thought.</br>Sore is my Wrath; some Vengeance have I sought.</br>Tremble, ye Miscreants, that in after Times</br>Shall rob an angry Poet of his Rhymes,</br>Which he with Toil of five long Years hath bought,</br>Or from their dim Cell draw the Cobwebs he hath wrought.", "Of that sweet Stream whose witching Draught inspires</br>Illusive Dreams the Woes of Life to hide,</br>That, lull'd a while by more than mortal Lyres,</br>Repose &mdash; but soon, on Fancy's ebbing Tide,</br>Emerge enormous, and more dreadful Ride.</br>That Stream, divinely dangerous, may'st thou more</br>And deeper drink than any Bard before;</br>And the long Gloom of dark December 'bide</br>In B&mdash;'s leafless Shades to hear a Poet chide.</br>"]
