["The Day returns, &mdash; the festive Day,</br>When Hymen to the rural Fane</br>His youthful Fav'rites led away,</br>To share and sooth each other's pain:</br>To make the tide of Rapture roll</br>Serenely o'er th' enamour'd Soul</br>Where Purity and wedded Love combine,</br>Its deathless Pow'rs to train to happiness divine.", "The Nymphs beheld with envious eye,</br>Fair EMMA to her DAMON giv'n;</br>The Swains suppress'd the hopeless sigh</br>For EMMA, fairest gift of heav'n:</br>But, Nymphs and Swains!  nor more repine;</br>For You, soon Hymen's torch shall shine</br>In smiling splendor from the realms above,</br>To light you to the Bow'r of soft connubial Love.", "Then, like the Worth-ennobled Pair</br>Who now receive the Muse's meed,</br>May your defence from ev'ry care</br>Be ev'ry just and gen'rous deed!</br>For Heav'n delights such deeds to bless,</br>Nor, long will suffer fell distress</br>To wring the heart where Virtue rears her throne,</br>Rules with benignant sway, and makes its wants her own.", "Long may her pow'r avert each harm,</br>And gain from Heav'n each mild decree,</br>Preserve them from each rude alarm,</br>And bid them happy happy be!</br>Long may their darling blooming Boys</br>Prove to their breast a source of Joys,</br>Bless them thro' Youth and Age till Life be o'er,</br>And meet their fond embrace, on heav'n's eternal shore.</br>"]
