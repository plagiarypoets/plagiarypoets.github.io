["Where the Summer-breeze sports the young willows among,</br>That hang their soft leaves o'er the brook stealing by;</br>Or deep in the grove, where the thrush's clear song</br>Warbles sweet thro' the green branches waving on high;</br>Aloft on hoar mountains assailing the sky,</br>Or low in the humble and wood-border'd vale,</br>Wherever wild Solitude's dark pinions fly;</br>There oft has the Poet his varying tale</br>Of Pleasure's blithe harmony sung, or Despondency's sorrowful tale.", "And blame not, ye worldlings, the choice he has made,</br>Nor contemn those delights which you never can share;</br>Not in vain does he live in Retirement's shade,</br>Nor in vain with the Muse hold fond intercourse there:</br>For the gales, on their swift-winged passage, will bear</br>Ev'ry note he shall utter, whose music can raise</br>Delight's happy smile, or draw Sympathy's tear:</br>And still on mankind with affection he'll gaze&mdash;</br>Softly whisper rebuke to their faults, but their virtues exultantly praise.", "Then leave him, ye tribes that crowd Gaiety's fane,</br>And ye that on Fashion's trim levee attend!</br>He likes not your faithless and fluttering train&mdash;</br>When Prosperity withers, your love's at an end!</br>Whilst he in the Muse finds an ever-warm friend,</br>He envies you not in this peaceable state;</br>If a few worthy inmates society lend,</br>He minds not whom honours or riches await;</br>But, grant him the smiles of the good &mdash; he cares not a whit for the great.</br>"]
