["Timotheus now, in music handy,</br>Struck up a tune call'd &mdash; Drops of Brandy;</br>The hero pulls out Thais to the dance:</br>Timotheus now struck up a reel;</br>The couple skipp'd with nimble heel,</br>Then sat them down, and drank a quart of Nantz.", "Now did the master of the lyre</br>On dancing exercise his fire.</br>He sung of hops at court, and wakes, and fairs;</br>He sung of dancing dogs, and dancing bears;</br>He prais'd the minuet of Nan Catley,</br>And lumps of pudding, and Moll Pately:</br>The king grew proud, and soon began to reel,</br>A hopping inspiration seiz'd his heel.", "Bravi, bravi, the soldier crowd</br>In admiration cry'd aloud.</br>The lady dances like a bold Thalestris,</br>And Alexander hops like Monsieur Vestris.</br>Again, so furiously they dance a jig,</br>The lady lost her cap, the hero lost his wig.", "The motley mob, behind, before,</br>Exclaim'd &mdash; encore!  encore!  encore!</br>Proud of th' applause, and justly vain,</br>Thais made a curtsey low,</br>Such as court ladies make before the queen.</br>Alexander made a bow,</br>Such as the royal levee oft has seen,</br>And then they danc'd the reel again.", "Of vast applause the couple vain,</br>Delighted, danc'd the reel again:</br>Now in, and now out,</br>They skipp'd it about,</br>As tho' they felt the madness of the moon;</br>Such was the power of Timothy and tune.", "When the dub a dub, a dub dub drum,</br>In triumph behind e'm beat &mdash; Go to bed, Tom.", "And now in their ire,</br>Return'd from the fire,</br>In revenge for the Greeks that were dead,</br>The king and his punk</br>Got most horribly drunk,</br>And together went reeling to bed.</br>"]
