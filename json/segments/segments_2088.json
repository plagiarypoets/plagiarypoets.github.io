["Fair and free soul of poesy, O Keats!</br>O how my temples throb, my heart-blood beats,</br>At every, image, every word of thine!</br>Thy bosom, pierced by Envy, drops to rest;</br>Nor hearest thou the friendlier voice, nor seest</br>The sun of fancy climb along thy line.", "But under it, altho a viperous brood</br>That stung an Orpheus (in a clime more rude</br>Than Rhodope and Hemus frown upon)</br>Still writhes and hisses, and peers out for more</br>Whose buoyant blood they leave concreted gore,</br>Thy flowers root deep, and split the creviced stone.", "Ill may I speculate on scenes to come,</br>Yet I would dream to meet thee at our home</br>With Spenser's quiet, Chaucer's livelier ghost,</br>Cognate to thine . . not higher, and less fair . .</br>And Madaline and Isabella there</br>Shall say, without thee half our lutes were lost.</br>"]
