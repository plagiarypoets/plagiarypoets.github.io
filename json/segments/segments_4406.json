["Now Spring's (chearful season) return'd,</br>Be joyous, ye sons of the spray;</br>Why longer should Nature be mourn'd?</br>Come, Phillis, and listen my lay.", "O come, my delight and my love,</br>Thy shepherd no artfulness knows;</br>The wreath that you yesterday wove,</br>To day shall be fix'd on my brows.", "And Flora shall lend me her stores,</br>(For Flora must shortly be here)</br>To crown thee, my fair one, with flow'rs,</br>Such crowns, even goddesses wear.", "See, see how the primroses grow,</br>What violets the hedges adorn;</br>Already the sloe-bushes blow,</br>Diffusing their sweets to the morn.", "Bright Phoebus in golden array,</br>Revisits our borders again,</br>Ye villager virgins be gay,</br>Be jovial, each jocular swain.</br>"]
