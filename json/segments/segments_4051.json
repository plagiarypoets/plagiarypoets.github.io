["When to the winds the firm oak's stately form</br>Sways, while each branch is as an organ-key</br>Dash'd to mad music by the frantic storm,</br>And swells the full tremendous melody,</br>I love amid the sounding woods to be,</br>And with a stern and solemn rapture hear</br>The straining forest's thunder &mdash; 'tis to me</br>An hour of awful bliss and glorious fear!&mdash;</br>But wilder, stranger still, swells on the ear</br>That shrill sound heard amid the tempest's pause,</br>As 'twere a Phantom's whisper, deep yet clear,</br>While its dread breath anew the spent blast draws:&mdash;</br>Sounds not that Voice, which makes the listener pale,</br>Like some lone Forest-Spirit's desolate wail?</br>"]
