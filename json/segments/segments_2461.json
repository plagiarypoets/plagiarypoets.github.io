["I, who my Royal Master once did save,</br>And thence the glorious Name of Royal gain'd,</br>Am now prophan'd by every Peasant Slave,</br>To deck Rebellion's hideous Brow constrain'd.", "Of me the civic Crown, in Days of Yore,</br>Was form'd for him who 'midst the bloody Fray</br>Preserv'd a Neighbour press'd in Battle sore;</br>And by his Valour bore him safe away.", "But they that wear me now, wild, frantic, blind,</br>Their Force against their fastest Friends employ,</br>Regardless of the Ills that lurk behind,</br>Headlong they rush, their Country to destroy.", "Against the Laws of God and Man they rise,</br>Pretending Grievances, but feeling none:</br>God's tender Mercies tow'rds this Isle despise;</br>Too prosperous grown, they seek to be undone.", "Oh!  had they chosen out some baneful Weed,</br>Which better with their black Designs might suit;</br>Then from foul Disgrace I had been freed,</br>And might have still remain'd in high Repute.", "But Vengeance shall not sleep!  A chosen Band</br>Of Men renown'd in Battles shall appear,</br>And carry Desolation thro' their Land;</br>And from their Rebel Heads my Foliage tear.", "I too will lend my Trunk and spreading Boughs,</br>Whereon the Catiffs shall suspended swing:</br>That all may know the Cause which I espouse,</br>And to my Shrine the proper Off'rings bring.</br>"]
