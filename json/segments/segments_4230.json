["Not the winter which mellows the earth,</br>And defends by a carpet of snow,</br>Not the spring, which to nature gives birth,</br>Nor the summer's more vehement glow;</br>'Tis the autumn alone that can yield</br>Aught the farmer thinks worthy his sight;</br>'Tis the produce alone of his field</br>Which affords him a moment's delight.", "Not the faint rosy blush of the morn,</br>Nor the bright-beaming glories of day,</br>When the sun to the center is borne,</br>And the clouds fly before him away;</br>Not the ev'ning, all soft and serene,</br>When the god bending down to the west,</br>Leaves the nymphs and the swains of the green</br>To recline on his Thetis's beast;", "Nor the silver-bright beauties of night,</br>Full orb'd when the sun does appear,</br>Can engage for a moment his sight,</br>Or suspend for a moment his care.</br>Surrounded with all that is fair,</br>Surveying each beauty that grows;</br>If it rains &mdash; why the wretch will despair,</br>And revile the great cause, if it snows.", "If the sun shines &mdash; 'twill burn up his corn,</br>And the wind will destroy all his fruit;</br>And if cloudy advances the morn,</br>More cloudy &mdash; behold the vile brute.</br>Thus unconscious of beauty he strays,</br>Where beauties alone can be seen;</br>And heeds not the winde of the maze,</br>And regards not the sweets of the green.</br>"]
