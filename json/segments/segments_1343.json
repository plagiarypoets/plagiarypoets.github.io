["Hail!  Friendship hail, thou source divine,</br>Whence copious streams of pleasure flow,</br>Inspiring every heart benign</br>With all thy honest warmth to glow;</br>Not vain thy power; for where extends thy sway,</br>Unsullied honour o'er the heart presides;</br>Vice from thy presence shrinks abash'd away,</br>And white-rob'd Virtue all thy actions guides;</br>Her beaming sceptre casts thy holy spell;</br>And in the circle all the moral graces dwell.", "Oh!  blest irradiation mild,</br>To cheer us on our weary way,</br>Whether through gloomy desarts wild,</br>Or vales which fancy paints we stray;</br>For where each brilliant pointed beam extends,</br>The effects of vice no more disturb the mind</br>Illumined; but she cheerly onward bends,</br>With rapture, permanent, as great, to find</br>At thy pure crystal fount, without controul,</br>\"The feast of reason, and the flow of soul.\"", "Scowling indignant round the scene,</br>Her devious tracks full fraught with woe,</br>Misfortune moves with pallid mien,</br>Around, her venom'd shafts to throw;</br>And where she moves will friendship eager press,</br>With pity's tear soft-trembling in her eye,</br>To sooth the rustling gales of grief, and bless</br>The darkening gloom with rays of constancy;</br>Kindly the lengthened roll of ills to share;</br>At last, to steal the sting from heart-corroding care.", "So when the tempest-driven car</br>Old Winter mounts, with rapid pace</br>Around to spread destructive war</br>O'er nature's animated space;</br>Haply soft peering midst some snow-fringed vale,</br>An ever-green may charm the wanderer's eye,</br>That braves the fury of the passing gale,</br>Till on its bloom the summer's breath shall sigh;</br>Waving its green leaves in the sun-shine hour,</br>That withered not, assailed by winter's ruthless power.</br>"]
