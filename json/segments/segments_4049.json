["Oh suffering Spain!  survey thine Argo's world&mdash;</br>See Bolivar's flag where Pizarro's flew&mdash;</br>See the proud ensigns of the free unfurl'd</br>From Niagara's flood to far Peru!&mdash;</br>What  man has done, again may not man do?</br>Flows not thy blood from them whose swords of yore</br>Cleft a red path Rome's own firm legions through,</br>And spurned to Calpe's wave the flying Moor?</br>Wake, land of Chivalry! &mdash; let Ebro pour</br>Henceforth his murmurs on the freeman's ear,</br>And let each grey Sierra statelier soar</br>To see \"the Mountain-nymph\" again draw near!&mdash;</br>Riego's spirit bids thee wake again&mdash;</br>Oh, speaks thy lost Leonidas in vain?</br>"]
