["BOTH.</br>What means the sad silence around?</br>The herds from the coverts are fled;</br>What means the mute village bell's sound?</br>Say, Phillis, what shepherd is dead?", "Alexis, the pride of our plain,</br>Who sung of our loves in the grove;</br>All nature admir'd his strain,</br>And call'd him the poet of love.", "CORYDON.</br>He was next, my fond Phillis, to thee;</br>His life was a summer of love;</br>His fancy was easy and free,</br>And shone like the prospect above.", "Not a tree on the plain but he lov'd,</br>He joy'd when the fond mother sung;</br>Not a branch in his life he remov'd,</br>For fear of disturbing their young.", "PHYLLIS.</br>The sweets of the seasons perfume,</br>Were lovelier still in his lays;</br>Pastora was ever in bloom,</br>So fond was the nymph of his praise.", "The beautiful tenants of May,</br>Rejoic'd when he courted the green;</br>His morning was lovely and gay,</br>His ev'ning was mild and serene.", "CORYDON.</br>But see the sad shepherds appear,</br>The once happy swains of the Tweed;</br>Ye seasons, come follow his bier,</br>For now you are mourners indeed.", "Come play we his Withering Rose,</br>The last of his elegant lays;</br>The pastoral current is froze,</br>His own can best picture his praise.</br>"]
