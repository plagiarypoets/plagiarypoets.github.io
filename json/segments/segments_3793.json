["Hail, sober nymph, in cloudy vest bedight!</br>At thy approach the weary plough-man sings,</br>As thro' the gloomy lane</br>He drives his team afield;</br>When Phoebus joys to rest on Thetis' lap,</br>Thou gently skimming o'er the misty fields,</br>Adorn'st with vernal dew</br>The drooping cowlip's head,</br>And from the hare-bell call'st the jocund Fayes</br>To sport in circles o'er the velvet plain;</br>Soon as thy star appears,</br>The cawing rooks retire</br>To the dark grove, and seek their waving nests;</br>While from yon mould'ring tow'r the grey-ey'd owl</br>Offers in dismal note,</br>Her ev'ning orisons;</br>And the amphibious bat, with piercing shriek,</br>Flirts round the weary pilgrim's aching head;</br>On the majestic oak</br>The chaffer-swarms rejoice;</br>And from the distant fold the simple bell,</br>With drowsy tink'ling, soothes the trav'ller's ear:</br>Now ev'ry passion sleeps;</br>E'en restless PRIDE subsides;</br>Corroding ENVY and soul-conqu'ring LOVE,</br>No longer now distract the human breast,</br>But all within is peace</br>And deep serenity.</br>\"Indulgent Ev'ning!  oft may I appear</br>A wand'ring vot'ry in thy pensive train!\"</br>Do thou unlock the springs</br>Of HEALTH and POETRY!</br>"]
