["O'er Powhatan's majestic flood</br>The orb of day descends the sky,</br>And, glimmering, lights the churchyard wood,</br>Where the first settlers mingled lie.", "Now fainter sounds the shrilling call</br>Of locust from the oak afar,</br>And to the steeple's ivied-wall</br>The pigeon flutters through the air.", "Pensive, I view the roofless wall</br>Where once the Atlantic fathers bent,</br>And, pealing, prais'd the Lord of all,</br>With incense from the bosom sent.", "Still is the voice that worship'd God,</br>And dim the supplicating eye,</br>Cold is the hand, beneath the clod,</br>That beg'd down blessings from on high.", "Here often mus'd with brow sublime,</br>The gallant Smith, for arms renown'd,</br>Whose polish'd lance, in Turkey's clime,</br>Threw horse and horseman to the ground.", "And here oft roam'd the tawny maid</br>Whose bosom heav'd at passion's call;</br>For in the town, or savage glade,</br>Resistless love is lord of all.", "Now o'er the settler's unwept grave,</br>The night-bird makes his funeral moan,</br>And, rising from the tranquil wave,</br>The queen of night ascends her throne.", "So still is now the lone churchyard,</br>That from the sea-worn, sandy grounds</br>The dapper elves afar are heard,</br>Footing their waving morrice round.", "And here where Meditation dwells,</br>I seek the unprotected grave,</br>Where sleep within their narrow cells</br>The rovers o'er the Atlantic wave.", "Death o'er the earth extends his hand</br>From tropic sun to polar snow;</br>And those who seek a foreign strand,</br>Await alike the unerring blow.", "Haply one lies beneath this turf,</br>Who hop'd again to cross the deep,</br>But scarce escap'd the Atlantic surf,</br>Death rock'd him in eternal sleep.", "No friend to smooth the bed of pain,</br>No friend to watch his asking eye;</br>He breath'd a wish beyond the main,</br>And gave to home his parting sigh.", "A bard perhaps this cold-clod hides,</br>Who oft beneath the cypress-shade,</br>Where to the flood the streamlet glides,</br>With harp bewail'd a distant maid.", "The sylvan-sisters hail'd the strain,</br>Along the deep the murmur stole;</br>'Twas wildly mix'd with joy and pain,</br>The rising wave forgot to roll!", "Without the lyre's recording string,</br>In vain the hero's pulses glow,</br>Unless the Muse her tribute bring,</br>His fame shall not through ages flow.", "Who knows but in this unsung grave,</br>A heart decays that in life's race,</br>Hop'd to be blazon'd with the brave,</br>And spurn'd the earth's contracted space.", "But see the solemn night retires,</br>The swains collect the fields to till,</br>And morning, rob'd in living fires,</br>Walks o'er the dew of yonder hill.</br>"]
