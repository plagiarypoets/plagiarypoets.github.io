["Mild offspring of a dark and sullen sire!</br>Whose modest form, so delicately fine,</br>Was nurs'd in whirling storms</br>And cradled in the winds.", "Thee, when young spring first question'd winter's sway,</br>And dar'd the sturdy blusterer to the fight,</br>Thee on this bank he threw</br>To mark his victory.", "In this low vale, the promise of the year,</br>Serene, thou openest to the nipping gale,</br>Unnoticed, and alone,</br>Thy tender elegance.", "So Virtue blooms, brought forth amid the storms</br>Of chill adversity, in some lone walk</br>Of life, she rears her head</br>Obscure and unobserved;", "While every bleaching breeze that on her blows,</br>Chastens her spotless purity of breast,</br>And hardens her to bear</br>Serene the ills of life.</br>"]
