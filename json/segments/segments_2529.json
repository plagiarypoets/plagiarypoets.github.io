["To prevent misrepresentation in these prosecuting times, it seems necessary to publish every thing relating to Tyranny and Oppression, though only among brutes, in the most guarded manner.</br>The following are meant as Specimens:&mdash;", "That tyger, or what other salvage wight</br>Is so exceeding furious and fell,</br>As WRONG,</br>[Not meaning our most gracious Sovereign Lord the King, or the Government of this country]</br>when it hath arm'd himself with might;</br>Not fit 'mong men that do with reason mell,</br>But 'mong wild beasts and salvage woods to dwell;</br>Where still the stronger</br>[Not meaning the Great Men of this country]</br>doth the weak devour,</br>And they that most in boldness doe excell,</br>Are draded most, and feared by their powre.</br>SPENCER.", "Let us, O ye Britons, shew what we not not mean, that the Attorney General may not, in his Indictments, do it for us.", "THE LION AND THE OTHER BEASTS.</br>FROM AESOP'S FABLES.", "The Lion [not meaning our Sovereign Lord the King] and several other beasts, [not meaning the continental Kings and Powers] entered into an alliance, offensive and defensive, and were to live very socially together in the forest [not meaning in Europe].  One day having made a sort of an excursion, [not meaning in France] by way of hunting, they took a very fine, large, fat deer, [mot meaning Dunkirk, Toulon, or any other place taken from the French] which was divided into four parts; there happening to be then present, his majesty the Lion, [not meaning as said before, our Sovereign Lord the King] and only three others.  After the division was made, and the parts were set out, his majesty [not meaning the King of England] advancing forward some steps, and pointing to one of the shares, was pleased to declare himself after the manner following:  \"This I seize and take possession of as my right, which devolves to me, as I am descended by a true, lineal, hereditary, succession from the Royal Family of Lion [not meaning in the least to vilify our Sovereign Lord the King, or the divine indefeasible right of hereditary succession:]  That (pointing to the second) I claim by, I think, no unreasonable demand, considering that all the engagements you have with the enemy turn chiefly upon my courage and conduct [not meaning to reflect on the military conduct or courage of our Sovereign Lord the King]; and you very well know that wars are too expensive to be carried on without proper supplies [not meaning among other wars to reflect on the war now carrying on against France.]   Then (nodding his head towards the third) that I shall take by virtue of my prerogative, [not meaning to reflect on the King's prerogatives] to which, I make no question, but so dutiful and loyal a people [not meaning to reflect on the runners or people of Bow-street, and other police officers, or the people of a press-gang] will pay all the deference and regard that I can desire.  Now, as for the remaining part, the necessity of our present affairs [not meaning to reflect on the state of the British finances] is so very urgent, our stock so low, and our credit [not meaning to reflect on the numerous bankruptcies of late in this country] so impaired and weakened, that I must insist upon your granting that without any hesitation or demur; and hereof fail not at your peril [not meaning to insinuate that our Sovereign Lord the King would take all to himself, and leave nothing to others].</br>"]
