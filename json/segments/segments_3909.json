["\"Yes, I remember, and with pride repeat,</br>The rapid progress which our friendship knew!</br>Ev'n at the first with willing minds we met,</br>And ere the root was fix'd, the branches grew;\"</br>Fortune in vain oppos'd her strong barrier;</br>Nor thou by int'rest sway'd, nor I o'eraw'd by fear.", "With sense, with sentiment, I saw thee blest,</br>With taste, with genius' brightest, kindliest ray:</br>Thy mind was virtue by the graces drest,</br>Thy form how faultless &mdash; that let others say:</br>T' admire such merit that I dar'd pretend,</br>\"Thou saw'st with partial eyes, and bade me call thee friend!\"", "Whence then this dire reverse?  Why alter'd now?</br>Estrang'd why fled'st thou the most blest of men?</br>Why lours resentment on thy beauteous brow?</br>Why stopt th' effusions of thy polish'd pen?</br>In vain, alas!  in vain thou didst pretend,</br>(Deny it not, rash maid) to bid me call thee friend!</br>"]
