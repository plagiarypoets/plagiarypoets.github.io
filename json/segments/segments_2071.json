["Thou art so fair, so excellently framed,</br>There is such mind in thy soul-breathing eye,</br>As if its purer home in heaven it claimed,</br>And thence alone could draw its witchery;&mdash;</br>Thy voice hath such a soothing melody,</br>And on thy lightest thought such magic plays,</br>Like a bright fountain on the gladdened sky,&mdash;</br>Methinks, as on thy perfect form I gaze,</br>In peace should be thy paths, in pleasantness thy ways!", "But when I think upon thy syren world,</br>Whose arms would clasp thee in their false embrace,&mdash;</br>Whose glittering banner in thy sight unfurled</br>From better views would turn thy lovely face;</br>Moulding thy docile spirit's winning grace</br>To the fair treasons of its painted wiles,&mdash;</br>I fain would snatch thee from that fatal race,</br>Whose giddy round each better thought beguiles,</br>And leaves the victor nought but pale and hollow smiles!", "So, &mdash; when before the eyes of lofty Rome</br>The Anglian captives stood, a blooming band,</br>Breathing of beauty from their sea-girt home,</br>And proudly, in that far and foreign land,</br>Recalling their white island's rocky strand,&mdash;</br>The Patriarch spake with mild and pitying eye,</br>And said, as their majestic forms he scanned,</br>\"Worthy their name! &mdash; like angels pure and high,</br>Angelic too should be their path and destiny!\"</br>"]
