["Oh memory!  thou busy source of pain!</br>Thou actor of our miseries o'er again!</br>Thou harsh intruder!  whose tormenting pow'r,</br>Instilling thought embitters every hour;</br>Forego thy bitter unrelenting sway,</br>Nor doom to horrours every coming day.</br>Ah what avails imagination's powers</br>With fancied bliss to cheat the tardy hours,</br>Whose sweet delusions banish care away</br>And to the mind bestow perpetual day;</br>If the sad soul is wrapp'd in joyless gloom</br>And sighs and lingers for the welcome tomb.</br>The sun with boundless glory fills the skies</br>And myriads joys where fair Hindostan lies:</br>Yon silver orb with fainter beams invite</br>The pensive muse each phylosophick night,</br>Those heavenly spheres resplendent gild the pole</br>And tell what hand supports and rules the whole.</br>Springs verdant charms now deck the joyful land,</br>And bounteous nature spreads with lavish hand,</br>Whilst ev'ry grove with feather'd choirs resounds</br>And richest paintings fill the smiling grounds,</br>When Summer heats prevail, the clown oppress'd,</br>Hies to the shade and lays him down to rest;</br>Whilst the dark wood a sweet asylum shows</br>Where the rap't soul with inspiration glows:</br>And Autumn next displays her reapen'd plain</br>Crown'd with rich fruits and fill'd with golden grain.</br>All, all, in vain. &mdash; The universe bestows</br>No charms, no pleasures, to deceive his woes.</br>The woodland warbling jars his sated ear&mdash;</br>The country lies a desart &mdash; wild and drear&mdash;</br>He wisely shuns the silent solemn glade</br>For harsh reflection haunts the gloomy shade.</br>Autumnal riches no new bliss supply;</br>They nothing yield to please the mental eye,</br>See, icy Winter chearless reigns around</br>And cities throng'd with mirth and joy abound;</br>The bliss which from the social mixture flows,</br>No gaiety, no happiness bestows;</br>Forlorn, unhappy, wretched, does he feel;</br>And prove how hard the task an anguish'd mind to heal.</br>Say from what source, can memory impart,</br>One pleasing sense to sooth the murderer's heart?</br>When busy fancy brings the injur'd shade</br>To haunt his solitude, his peace invade?</br>The guilty wretch, who waded to the throne</br>Thro' kindred blood, from danger conscious grown,</br>Now by the trembling limb and bloodless cheek</br>Betrays his crimes; nor can a refuge seek</br>From bleeding forms, who bare the mangled breast,</br>And to his frighten'd vision stand confest&mdash;</br>Behold that wretched tyrant youth expire;&mdash;</br>His frame consumed by more than mortal fire;</br>Stung by remorse, not all the charms of art,</br>Could hush his cares, or ease his aching heart:</br>Each hour recalls, the bloody dreadful day,</br>When by his mandate thousands slaughter'd lay,</br>When in cold blood confounding youth and age</br>His wretched subjects felt his bigot rage.</br>O, friend to Virtue!  whose all powerful aid,</br>Sooner or later owns the heav'nly maid;</br>In terrours cloth'd, the villain's mind assail;</br>And with just vengeance tear aside the veil,</br>That from himself his hideous portrait hides</br>And for his crimes a lasting scourge provides.</br>See the proud monument and marble bust,</br>With useless pomp insult the humble dust;</br>Whilst gorgeous pageants more supremely show,</br>That all parade is mockery of woe;</br>Unheeded by the father, lover, friend,</br>Who o'er the grave in silent anguish bend&mdash;</br>Will no kind genius watch the fatal hour,</br>And blunt the invidious tyrant's baleful power?</br>Lull with a syren's spells the aching sense,</br>And to the mind lethargick aid dispense?</br>Ah no &mdash; for all is horrour and dismay;</br>While yet the husband hugs the breathless clay.</br>Ten thousand thousand sad illusions rise</br>To aid his anguish and increase his sighs&mdash;</br>Now is recall'd each hour, each happy day</br>That smooth'd life's passage of the dreary way;</br>Now do contrasted pleasures mock his woes,</br>And to impending grief, lost virtue's charms oppose.</br>When the loud gate's tempestuous force descends,</br>And sharpest light'ning heav'ns vast concave rends;</br>Whilst thro' the crackling rigging howls the storm,</br>And naught prevails but tumult and alarm;</br>Then to the youthful breast of him who roves,</br>Far from the mistress whom he fondly loves;</br>Malicious mem'ry proves her hated art</br>And emulates the vile tormentor's part,</br>O, cursed gold!  the source of various woe;</br>From whom our sorrows more than pleasures flow:</br>In search of thee, I brav'd the faithful seas,</br>To gain by added fortune future ease:</br>For visionary wealth I wildly roam,</br>And madly leave my plighted love and home;</br>Fool, not to know, that competence was bliss,</br>And certain happiness exchange for this!</br>Let me again behold my native shore,</br>And I will tempt th' uncertain waves no more.&mdash;</br>But most when madness rules th' unhappy hour</br>Must wretched man sustain thy keenest power;</br>All other sense of joys or sorrows gone,</br>And the whole soul absorb'd with one alone.</br>Hail!

 when on the farthest verge</br>Of distant horizon, the faithless surge</br>Wafts towards his ravish'd sight a distant sail;</br>Oh with what extacies he feels the gale</br>That onward brings the long, long wish'd for aid,</br>So long to his unceasing prayers delay'd.</br>Alas!
