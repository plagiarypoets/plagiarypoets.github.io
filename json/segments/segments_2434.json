["How blithely roll the fleeting days of youth,</br>The happiest oft in this terrestrial state;</br>Tuition moulds the soul to virtuous truth,</br>Man's steadfast prop in all the storms of fate:</br>And when, of age, at length the ripening date</br>Compels him other scenes, afar, to view,</br>He leaves his home, his school, and each lov'd mate,</br>In distant lands some calling to pursue,</br>Warm from his heart shall burst the lingering, last adieu.", "We love the play-ground of our early years,</br>Where oft the hours of joy unnumber'd roll,</br>And memory long the hallowed spot endears,</br>Where first instruction dawn'd upon the soul:</br>And now, though hope's enchanting prospects glow,</br>In gay prospective through the coming years,</br>Backward the tide of feeling still must flow,</br>While busy memory every room endears,</br>And pays to Philom's walls the tribute of her tears.", "We part, and some perhaps to meet no more,</br>In scenes like this to pass the halcyon hours;</br>Culling the richest fruits of classic lore,</br>And twining garlands of Parnassian flowers:</br>And we, who still instruction's path pursue,</br>Within these hallowed walls no more shall meet,</br>Yet while we breathe the lingering, sad adieu,</br>Hope rises to the soul in prospect sweet,</br>And scenes of future joy our raptur'd fancy greet.", "We see transplanted to another scene</br>The plant of genius we have cultur'd here,</br>Where health shall glow, with roseate brow serene,</br>And joy and hope, each beating bosom cheer.</br>There where St. Mathew's lifts its sacred dome,</br>To lure our thoughts beyond this earthly dome,</br>Shall science find her consecrated home,</br>And learning fix her permanent abode,</br>And lead the youthful mind to virtue, and to GOD.</br>"]
