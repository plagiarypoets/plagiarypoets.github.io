["On you, my Lord, shall every Muse attend,</br>The Muses Patron and their noblest Friend:</br>In early Days Great Sidney Spenser crown'd,</br>Sidney the fam'd for Arts and Arms renown'd;</br>And next Southampton did our Shakespeare raise,</br>From mean obscurity to height of Praise;</br>The famous Buckingham to Cowley prov'd</br>A noble Patron, and his Genius mov'd;</br>Then sprung up Addison by Somers' Name,</br>Sacred to Wit, to Honour, and to Fame;</br>By Dorset, Hallifax and Prior great,</br>Rose to adorn the Business of the State;</br>But under Grafton's Wing shall every Bard,</br>Be Chear'd, and Countenanc'd, meet just reward,</br>By his great Influence the tuneful Nine,</br>(If I can right foretel by promis'd Sign)</br>Shall raise their drooping Heads, in splendor shine:</br>Gallia no longer of her Arts shall boast,</br>Arts which will ne'er be in Britannia lost,</br>Since Grafton from Hibernia's Rule comes o'er,</br>To cherish every Art on Britain's Shore:</br>Thro' his Protection shall each Science rise,</br>Each tow'ring Genius touch the vaulted Skies;</br>By Grafton nourish'd shall best Poets write,</br>And reach a Milton's or a Spenser's Flight:</br>From such Promotions such Excitements spring,</br>Once more the World may hear a Mantuan sing.", "Thus in Great Dorset's Time was Wit restor'd,</br>And all Parnassus own'd its rightful Lord,</br>The long neglected Muse then rose, aspir'd,</br>And Fame immortal from his Rays acquir'd.", "Now all ye Poets hail the joyful Day!</br>Illustrious Grafton o'er Wit's Cause bears sway;</br>Ye Arts and Sciences for Joy prepare,</br>And merit ever his peculiar Care;</br>He's the Mecaenas, Sidney, Dorset, All,</br>Whom glorious Patrons we can justly call;</br>He soars aloft amidst the titled Crowd,</br>He's Great, he's Noble, Generous, and Good:</br>Were all Preferments fill'd like his, to come,</br>Then shou'd we equal Athens and old Rome.</br>"]
