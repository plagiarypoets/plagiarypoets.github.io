["In olden times, in chivalry's fair law</br>The youth were trained, that sought renowned name,</br>Were taught the lance to wield, the sword to draw,</br>The spear and shield to toss in warlike game,</br>And in their hearts, to cherish love's bright flame,</br>In wild adventure they spent every hour,</br>And grace and honor sought, where'er they came,</br>Whether in festal hall, or ladies' bower,</br>Or battering at the gates of some enchanted tower.", "But now-a-day Romance is banished,</br>And those gay fairy forms that shone so bright,</br>Fair Love, clear Honour, all have vanished,</br>Friendship, firm Truth, and bold defence of right;&mdash;</br>Our best, our brightest hopes are quenched in night!</br>The cold world scornful glances at us darts,</br>For in the world's joys we may not delight,</br>We do not love the merchant's crowded marts,</br>Nor to seek fame and gain by dull forensic arts.", "Yet we must trim our vessel to the tide,</br>And steer our courses as the currents flow,</br>By the prevailing winds our bark must guide,</br>And catch the breezes as they chance to blow;</br>And through the world by the world's rules must go.</br>But though we yield us to the stern demand,</br>A very worldly wight, in outward show,</br>Still, in our hearts, Romance shall make a stand,</br>And in our secret soul, shall spring a \"fairy hand.\"</br>"]
