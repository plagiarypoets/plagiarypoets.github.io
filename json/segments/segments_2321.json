["Ye shepherds so blithsome and gay,</br>That pip'd and that danc'd on the mead,</br>No longer ye pipe and ye play,&mdash;</br>Your favourite Cunningham's dead.", "Ye lambkins that skip o'er the plain,</br>Ye warblers that sing in the grove,</br>You endeavour to please, but in vain&mdash;</br>How vain are your efforts to move!", "By the side of my Cunningham's hearse,</br>I've planted the laurel and bays;</br>No poet could equal his verse,</br>So artless, so soft, were his lays.", "How oft o'er thy tomb have I sigh'd,</br>Of men and of poets thou best!</br>Like thee would 'twere said I had died,</br>As happy as thee, and as blest!", "Oh!  Cunningham, ceaseless I'll mourn,</br>At thy loss I shall ever repine;</br>My tears shall besprinkle thy urn,</br>Till my breast be as frozen as thine.</br>"]
