["Had not thy righteous law been my delight,</br>When friends forsook and earthly comforts fled,</br>And cruel foes display'd their envious spite,</br>Most surely I had sunk among the dead,</br>And cold oblivion's dew had rested on my head.", "Yet still I live, Oh, let my praise arise,</br>To Him who, cloth'd with majesty and might,</br>And seated in his temple of the skies,</br>Sends gifts to man, with peace, and life, and light;</br>But thou, my soul, art vile and sinful in his sight.", "Oh, lead me from those paths with error fraught,</br>Whose snares too oft my heedless steps betide;</br>Restrain the hasty speech, and roving thought,</br>And fear of feeble man, and causeless pride,</br>And all the secret ills that in my heart reside.</br>"]
