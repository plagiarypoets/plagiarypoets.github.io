["Bright eye of pensive eve!  resplendent orb</br>That o'er the misty mountains shinest clear;</br>Like a rich gem,</br>Upon an Aethiop's brow!", "Thy lamp serene, my now benighted steps</br>Directs, to that blest spot where dwells my fair,</br>Twin rivals who can boast</br>More pure, more bright than thee.", "For not thy lovely light, that kindly cheers</br>The sullen frown of unpropitious night;</br>Is half so sweet as truth,</br>That beams in beauty's eyes.", "Not all the little waking elves, that rise</br>From out their rosy bow'rs of velvet buds,</br>Where they had slept the day,</br>To dance thy rays beneath,", "Feel such delight as does this breast, when thou</br>With radiant lustre shew'st the happy hour,</br>That leads from scenes of care</br>To still domestic bliss.</br>"]
