["I said, &mdash; \"On the banks of the Stream,</br>I've pip'd for the Shepherds too long:</br>Oh grant me, ye Muses, a Theme,</br>Where Glory may brighten my Song!\"</br>But Pan bade me stick to my Strain,</br>Nor Lessons too lofty rehearse;</br>Ambition befits not a Swain,</br>And Phyllis loves Pastoral Verse.", "The Rose, tho' a beautiful Red,</br>Looks faded to Phyllis's Bloom!</br>And the Breeze from the Bean-Flower Bed</br>To her Breath's but a feeble Perfume;</br>The Dew-Drop so limpid and gay,</br>That loose on the Violet lies,</br>(Tho' brighten'd by Phoebus's Ray)</br>Wants Lustre compar'd to her Eyes.", "A Lily I pluck'd in full Pride,</br>Its Freshness with her's to compare;</br>And foolishly thought ('till I try'd)</br>The Flowret was equally fair.</br>How, Corydon, could you mistake?</br>Your Fault be with Sorrow confest!</br>You said, the white Swans on the Lake</br>For Softness might rival her Breast.", "While thus I went on in her Praise,</br>My Phyllis pass'd sportive along;</br>Ye Poets I covet no Bays,</br>She smil'd &mdash; a Reward for my Song!</br>I find the God Pan's in the Right,</br>No Fame's like the Fair-One's Applause,</br>And Cupid must crown with Delight</br>The Shepherd that sings in his Cause.</br>"]
