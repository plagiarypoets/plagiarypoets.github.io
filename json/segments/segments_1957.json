["He's gone!  the gallant and the gifted youth,</br>And plies his glorious search no more below.</br>His search was knowledge, well-earned fame, and truth:</br>For these he crossed the trackless wastes of snow;</br>For these he held communion with the deep,</br>And traced the silent heavens, while all around was sleep.", "He watch'd the gleaming points of dubious light,</br>Which cheat the gazer with a treacherous dawn;</br>He mark'd the stars that wheel their circles bright,</br>Through midnight skies, but vanish in the morn.</br>Like these he faded from his opening day,</br>Like those his brightness gleam'd, and darkness quench'd the ray.", "When waters raged and down the billowy fall</br>Death chased the bark, and sprang to seize his prey,</br>He dared to pass, and utter'd first the call,</br>To save the sinking comrades.  On that day</br>A Hero's fame he earn'd, and many a voice</br>For Husband, Father saved, doth in that fame rejoice.", "But on the verge of a more dread abyss,</br>He stood in greater calmness; knew the stream</br>Of life was bearing him to gulfs than this</br>More deep, more overwhelming.  We may deem</br>A Christian Hero him, who view'd life's close</br>With steady eye, and faith, the spirit's calm repose.", "\"He trusted still.\"  And was his trust in vain?</br>O no!  it cheer'd him to his latest hour,</br>And will beyond the grave.  It soothes the pain</br>Of those who mourn to see his face no more.</br>It tells, \"Let heroes share their hard-earn'd fame,</br>But reverence and love endear the Christian's name.\"</br>"]
