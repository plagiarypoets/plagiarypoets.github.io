["Young Damon the shepherd, one ev'ning in May,</br>Reclin'd in a jessamine bow'r,</br>Indulging the notes of the amorous lay,</br>To sorrow devoted the hour.", "Of Nancy he warbl'd, of Nancy, whose charms</br>Beam'd fair in the eyes of the swain;</br>Of Nancy, whom oft he had woo'd to his arms,</br>Tho' all his intreaties were vain.", "While thus unregarded, the flame in his breast</br>Burst ardent, despising controul;</br>He blam'd the dear virgin, the bane of his rest,</br>And vented the wish of his soul.", "\"Ye gods of the woodlands, ye patrons of love,</br>Let Nancy be kind as she's fair,</br>Or far from my bosom her image remove,</br>And free me from racking despair.\"", "He pray'd till kind Nature, with bountiful gale,</br>Collecting the fragrance of spring,</br>Convey'd the sweet treasure that scented the dale</br>On Zephyr's ambrosial wing.", "The soft lulling murmurs united their sound,</br>And waited the swain to repose,</br>While Fancy, still waking, her blessings unbound,</br>And banish'd the train of his woes;", "For Nancy, he thought, with an innocent smile,</br>Approach'd to the bow'r where he lay,</br>And fondly imagin'd she mutter'd the while</br>The folly of Damon's delay.", "He thought on his bosom her head was declin'd,</br>He dream'd she had ravish'd a kiss,</br>And, toss'd by the transport that swell'd in his mind,</br>Awoke in a rapture of bliss;", "For Nancy so closely was lock'd in his arms,</br>In vain she attempted to fly;</br>With ardour he press'd her &mdash; she yielded her charms,</br>And blush'd her consent with a sigh.", "How happy together they live in the cot,</br>Nor envy the splendor of power;</br>For love and tranquility sweeten their lot,</br>The guests of the Jessamine bower.</br>"]
