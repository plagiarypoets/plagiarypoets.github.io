["If love's bright beams e'er found a resting place,</br>'Twas in that softly, tender, feeling breast,</br>Whose sweet affection fondly loves to trace</br>The woes which oft our feeble frame infest;</br>And with the balm of kindness sooth to rest</br>The anguish of devouring, rending pain;</br>With cheerful smiles the wo-worn soul invest</br>With joy, like sunbeams shining in the rain,</br>Till heavenly light undim'd spreads o'er the lovely plain.", "Yes, if there be, cloth'd in a mortal form,</br>Celestial virtue from heaven's starry sphere,</br>'Tis in that soul, with tearful pity warm,</br>With kind relief that dries affliction's tear:</br>Thou, then, to me for ever shalt be dear,</br>Who didst, when thrilling pain my strength unstrung,</br>Before me with thy tender hand appear,</br>And like the blooming tendril, frail and young,</br>And helpless and alone, my arms around thee clung.", "When thou hadst borne me to that kind retreat,</br>Where two fond brothers dwell, with brows of light,</br>And piety divine had fix'd its seat;</br>Soft, heavenly beings met my raptur'd sight,</br>With smiles of seraphs beaming sweetly bright;</br>Gay as the op'ning morning's smiling bloom,</br>And whisp'ring like soft zephyrs of the night,</br>Which breathe from fairest flowers of rich perfume,</br>While Cynthia's radiant rays the fragrant path illume.</br>"]
