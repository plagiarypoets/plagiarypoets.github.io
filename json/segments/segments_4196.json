["Hail!  ye sacred horrors hail!</br>Which brooding o'er this lonely vale,</br>Swell the heart, impearl the eye,</br>And raise the rapt soul to the sky.</br>Hail!  spirits of the swarthy dead,</br>Who, flitting thro' the dreary shade,</br>To rouse your sons to vengeance fell,</br>Nightly raise the troublous yell!</br>Hail!  Minister of Ill, whose iron pow'r</br>Pervades resistless earth, and sea, and air,</br>Shed all thy influence on this solemn hour,</br>When we with magic rites the white man's doom prepare.", "Thus Congo spake, \"what time the moon,</br>Riding in her highest noon!\"</br>Now beam'd upon the sable crowd,</br>Now vanish'd in the thickening cloud.</br>'Twas silence all &mdash; with frantic look,</br>His spells the hoary wizard took</br>Bending o'er the quiv'ring flame,</br>Convulsion shook his giant frame.</br>Close and more close the shuddering captives throng,</br>With breath repress'd, and straining eye, they wait&mdash;</br>When midst the plantains bursts the awful song,</br>The words of mystic might, that seal their tyrants' fate.", "Haste!  the magic shreds prepare&mdash;</br>Thus the white man's corse we tear.</br>Lo!  feathers from the raven's plume,</br>That croaks our proud Oppressor's doom.</br>Now to aid the potent spell,</br>Crush we next the brittle shell&mdash;</br>Fearful omen to the foe,</br>Look!  the blanched bones we throw.</br>From mouldering graves we stole this hallow'd earth,</br>Which, mix'd with blood, winds up the mystic charm;</br>Wide yawns the grave for all of northern birth,</br>And soon shall smoke with blood each sable warrior's arm.", "Hark!  the pealing thunders roll,</br>Grateful to the troubled soul.</br>See!  the gleamy lightnings play,</br>To point you to your destin'd prey.</br>Hence!  with silent foot and slow,</br>And sudden strike the deadly blow:</br>Your foes, the palmy shade beneath,</br>Lie lock'd in sleep &mdash; their sleep is death!</br>Go!  let the memory of the smarting thong</br>Outplead the pity that would prompt to save:</br>Go let the Oppressor's contumelious wrong,</br>Twice nerve the hero's arm, and make the coward brave.</br>"]
