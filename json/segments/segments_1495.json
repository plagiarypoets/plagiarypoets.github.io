["Thou, who beholdst with dewy eye,</br>The sleeping leaves, and folded flowers,</br>And hear'st the night wind lingering sigh,</br>Through the shadowy woods and twilight bowers;</br>Thou wast the signal once that seem'd to say,</br>Hilario's beating breast reprov'd my long delay.", "I see thy emerald lustre stream,</br>O'er these rude cliffs, and cavern'd shore;</br>But here, orisons to thy beam</br>The woodland chauntress pours no more;</br>Nor I, as once, thy lamp propitious hail,</br>Seen indistinct through tears; confus'd, and dim, and pale,", "Soon shall thy arrowy radiance shine</br>On the broad ocean's restless wave,</br>Where this poor, cold swoln form of mine</br>Shall shelter in its billowy grave,</br>Safe from the scorn the world's sad outcasts prove,</br>Unconscious of the pain of ill-requited love.</br>"]
