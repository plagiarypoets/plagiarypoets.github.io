["O'er Moorlands and Mountains rude, barren, and bare,</br>As wilder'd and wearied I roam,</br>A gentle young Shepherdess sees my Despair,</br>And leads me o'er Lawns to her home.</br>Yellow Sheafs from rich Ceres her Cottage had crown'd,</br>Green Rushes were strew'd on her Floor,</br>Her Casement sweet Woodbines crept wantonly round,</br>And deck'd the Sod Seats at her Door.", "We sate ourselves down to a cooling Repast:</br>Fresh Fruits!  and she cull'd me the best:</br>Whilst, thrown from my Guard by some Glances she cast,</br>Love slily stole into my Breast.</br>I told my soft Wishes &mdash; she sweetly reply'd,</br>(Ye Virgins her Voice was divine!)</br>I've rich ones rejected, and great ones deny'd,</br>Yet take me, fond Shepherd &mdash; I'm thine.", "Her Air was so modest, her Aspect so meek,</br>So simple, yet sweet were her Charms,</br>I kiss'd the ripe Roses that glow'd on her Cheek,</br>And lock'd the lov'd Maid in my Arms.</br>Now jocund together we tend a few Sheep;</br>And if &mdash; on the Banks by the Stream,</br>Reclin'd on her Bosom I sink into Sleep,</br>Her Image still softens my Dream.", "Together we range o'er the slow-rising Hills,</br>Delighted with pastoral Views,</br>Or rest on the Rock whence the Streamlet distills,</br>And mark out new Themes for my Muse.</br>To Pomp or proud Titles she ne'er did aspire;</br>The Damsel's of humble Descent!</br>The Cottager PEACE is well known for her Sire,</br>And Shepherds have nam'd her CONTENT.</br>"]
