["I.</br>O Thou, who bad'st thy Turtles bear</br>Swift from his Grasp thy golden Hair,</br>And sought'st thy native Skies:</br>When War, by Vultures drawn from far,</br>To Britain bent his Iron Car,</br>And bad his Storms arise!", "II.</br>Tir'd of his rude tyrannic Sway,</br>Our Youth shall fix some festive Day,</br>His sullen Shrines to burn:</br>But Thou who hear'st the turning Spheres,</br>What Sounds may charm thy partial Ears,</br>And gain thy blest Return!", "III.</br>O Peace, thy injur'd Robes up-bind,</br>O rise, and leave not one behind</br>Of all thy beamy Train:</br>The British Lion, Goddess sweet,</br>Lies stretch'd on Earth to kiss thy Feet,</br>And own thy holier Reign.", "IV.</br>Let others court thy transient Smile,</br>But come to grace thy western Isle,</br>By warlike Honour led!</br>And, while around her Ports rejoice,</br>While all her Sons adore thy Choice,</br>With Him for ever wed!</br>"]
