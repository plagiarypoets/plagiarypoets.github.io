["Weep o'er the miseries of a wretched maid,</br>Who sacrific'd to man her health and fame;</br>Whose love of truth and trust were all repaid,</br>By want and woe, disease and endless shame.", "Curse not the poor lost wretch, who, ev'ry ill,</br>That proud unfeeling man can heap, sustains;</br>Sure she enough is curst o'er whom his will,</br>Enflam'd by brutal passion, boundless reins.", "Spurn not my fainting body from your door,</br>Here let me rest my weary weeping head;</br>No greater mercy would my wants implore,</br>My sorrows soon shall lay me with the dead.", "Who now behold but loaths my faded face,</br>So wan and sallow, chang'd with sin and care?</br>Or who can any former beauty trace,</br>In eyes so sunk in famine and despair?", "That I was virtuous once, and beauteous too,</br>And free from envious tongues my spotless fame;</br>These but torment, these but my tears renew,</br>These aggravate my present grief and shame.", "Expell'd by all, enforc'd by pining want,</br>I've wept and wander'd many a midnight hour;</br>Implor'd a pittance lust would seldom grant,</br>Or sought a shelter from the driving show'r.", "Oft as I rov'd, while beat the wintry storm,</br>Unknowing what to seek or where to stray,</br>To gain relief, entic'd each hideous form,</br>Each hideous form contemptuous turn'd away.", "Where were my virgin honours, where my charms?</br>Oh!  whither fled the pride I once maintain'd;</br>Or where the youths that woo'd me to their arms,</br>Or where the triumphs which my beauty gain'd?", "Ah!  say, insidious Damon!  Monster!  Where?</br>What glory hast thou gain'd by my defeat?</br>Art thou more happy now that I'm less fair?</br>Or bloom the laurels o'er my winding sheet?</br>"]
