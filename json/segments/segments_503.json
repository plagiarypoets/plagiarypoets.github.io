["In aunciente days tradition showes</br>A sorrie wicked elfe arose,</br>The Witch of Wokey hight;</br>Oft have I heard the fearfull tale,</br>From Sue and Roger of the vale,</br>Told out in winter's night.", "Deep in a dreary dismal cell,</br>Which seem'd, nay was y-cleped hell,</br>The blue-eyed hag was sty'd;</br>Nine wicked elves, as legends sayne,</br>By night she chose her guardian trayne,</br>All kennell'd close her side.", "Here baleful owls oft made their nest,</br>While wolves its craggy sides possest,</br>Night howling thro' the rocks;</br>No wholesome herb cou'd here be found,</br>She blasted ev'ry plant around,</br>And blister'd o'er the flocks.", "Her haggard face, so foul to see,</br>Her mouth unmeet a mouth to be,</br>With eyne of deadly leer,</br>She nought devis'd, but neighbour's ill,</br>On all she wreak'd her wayward will,</br>And marr'd all godlie cheer.", "All in her prime have poets sung,</br>No gaudy youth gallant and young,</br>E'er blest her longing armes;</br>Hence rose her fell despight to vex,</br>And blast the youth of either sex,</br>By dint of hellish charms.", "From Glaston came a learned wight,</br>Full bent to marr her fell despight,</br>And well he did, I ween;</br>Save her's sich mischief ne'er was knowne,</br>And since his mickle lerninge showne,</br>Sich mischief ne'er has been.", "He chauntede out his godlie book,</br>He cross'd the water, blest the brook,</br>Then &mdash; Pater-noster done,</br>The ghastly hag he sprinkled o'er,</br>When, lo!  where stood the hag before,</br>Now stood a ghastly stone.", "Full well 'tis known adown the vale,</br>Tho' strange may seem the fearful tale,</br>Eke wond'rous may appear;</br>I'm bold to say, there's never one,</br>That has not seen the witch of stone,</br>With all her houshould geer.", "But tho' this lernede clerke did well,</br>With grievede heart, alas!  I tell,</br>She left this curse behinde:</br>\"My sex shall be forsaken quite,</br>Tho' sense and beauty both unite,</br>Nor find a man that's kind.\"", "Now lo!  e'en as this fiend did say,</br>The sex have found it to this day,</br>That men are wond'rous scante;</br>Here's sense and beauty both combin'd,</br>With all that's good and virtuous joyn'd,</br>Yet scarce there's one gallante.", "Shall such fair nymphs thus daily moane!</br>They might I trow, as well be stone,</br>As thus forsaken dwell:</br>Since Glaston now can boast no clerks,</br>From Oxenford come down, ye sparks,</br>And help revoke the spell.", "Yet stay &mdash; nor thus despond, ye fair;</br>Virtue's the god's peculiar care;</br>Then mark their kindlie voice,</br>\"Your sex shall soon be blest agen,</br>We only wait to find sich men,</br>As may be worth sich choice.\"</br>"]
