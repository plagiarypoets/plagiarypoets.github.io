["In the days of my childhood, as sportive I play'd</br>Among the young lasses around,</br>I was fond then of laughing, my grandmother said,</br>None merrier ever was found;</br>To fill up the moments with joy and delight,</br>I scarcely knew what I'd be at;</br>Whatever was pleasing that came to my sight,</br>I could not help laughing at that.", "Still the humour prevails, tho' maturer I'm grown,</br>I am happy to smile time away;</br>The frolicks of fancy I still make my own,</br>And pleasantly spin out the day:</br>When the dull, or the splenetic, censure or chide</br>At my innocent freedom and prate,</br>I titter to hear their nonsensical pride,</br>For I cannot help laughing at that.", "Young Collin declares for a husband I'm fit,</br>So he courts me from morning to night;</br>On the charms of my person displays all his wit,</br>And I own that it gives me delight:</br>He talks of the parson, the church, and the ring,</br>In praise too of conjugal chat,</br>That wedlock, indeed, is an excellent thing,</br>So I must not get laughing at that.", "At length to his wishes, if I should comply,</br>As at present I seem to incline,</br>If but on his promises I may rely,</br>Not to check this good humour of mine,</br>To church with young Collin I'd soon trip away,</br>And answer all questions quite pat;</br>When it comes to the critical word call'd OBEY,</br>I shall scarcely keep laughing at that.</br>"]
