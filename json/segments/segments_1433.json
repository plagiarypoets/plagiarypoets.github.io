["The moors and mountains were their dwelling-place&mdash;</br>The mountain's side their temple and their grave&mdash;</br>Marvel not then, they were a rigid race,</br>Untaught to war, but turbulent and brave;&mdash;</br>Such are the warriors sufferers should have,</br>Who live in hope that's only not despair&mdash;</br>Such are the heroes who alone can save</br>A sinking cause &mdash; let tyranny beware</br>How she may rouse these slumb'ring lions from their lair!", "On the hill's side the worshippers convened,</br>Though not as now they meet, but on the Word,</br>Perchance, with one reclining arm they lean'd,</br>And with the other grasp'd the ready sword&mdash;</br>As did of old the servants of the Lord,</br>When they the ruin'd Jewish fane rebuilt,</br>Building the while with ready weapons stored;</br>For heedless how or where their blows they dealt,</br>Their foes pursued them there, and there much blood was spilt.", "Hark!  heard ye not the minstrelsy of war,</br>The shout, the drum, the clarion, and the shrill</br>And shrieking mountain-pipes mingling afar</br>With the sweet sacred music of the hill&mdash;</br>Sounds that might well awake wild terror's thrill</br>In other breasts &mdash; in theirs it kindles fire!</br>'O God!'  they cry, 'protect the remnant still!'</br>And then succeeds a scene of tumult dire&mdash;</br>A scene that suits but ill with my peace-loving lyre!", "But how secure!  how peaceful!  how serene!</br>Yon group of village worshippers appear:</br>Like the hush'd ocean where a storm hath been,</br>To make the calm succeeding doubly dear,</br>When all is lull'd, save the unceasing stir</br>Of waves scarce heaving, breaking, bubbling on,</br>And the light carol of some mariner</br>Whose fickle hopes had fled and come anon&mdash;</br>Such is the churchyard scene the sun now smiles upon.", "Here high and low are gather'd, small and great&mdash;</br>The peasants, rich and poor, and old and young;</br>To some the green grass turfs afford a seat;</br>And some are stretch'd full lazily along;</br>And some stand all erect amid the throng&mdash;</br>For show, perhaps, they stand &mdash; ah!  think not so;</br>And some on forms or chairs; and some among,</br>Or on the tombstones gray, in many a row,</br>Where some &mdash; nay all, perchance &mdash; have kindred lying low.</br>"]
