freed,</br>But out he goes the company among,</br>And where he sawe the people thick'st to throng:</br>There he thrusts in, and looketh round about:</br>Here he runnes in, and there he rusheth out;</br>That he was likely to have throwne to ground</br>Those in the way, which when the people found,</br>Though the poore Asse they seemed to disdaine,</br>Follow'd him yet, to finde what he should meane,</br>Untill by chance that he this Villaine mett;</br>When he upon him furiously doth sett,</br>Fastning his teeth upon him with such strength</br>That he could not be loosed, till at the length</br>Railing them in, the people make a ring,</br>Strooke with the wonder of so strange a thing;</br>Whilst they are cadg'd, contending whether can</br>Conquer, the Asse some cry, some cry the man;</br>Yet the Asse drag'd him, and still forward drue,</br>Towards the strange Spring, which yet they never knewe:</br>Yet to what part the strugling seem'd to sway,</br>The people made a lane, and gave them way.</br>At length the Asse, had tug'd him neere thereto,</br>The people wondring what he meant to doe;</br>He seem'd to show them with his foote the Well,</br>Then with an Asse-like noise he seem'd to tell</br>The Story, now by pointing to the men,</br>Then to the Theefe, then to the Spring agen;</br>At length wext angry, growing into passion,</br>Because they could not finde his demonstration,</br>T' expresse it more, he leapes into the Spring,</br>When on the suddaine, O most wondrous thing,</br>To change his shape he presently began,</br>And at an instant became perfect man,</br>Recovering speech; and comming forth, accus'd</br>The bloody murtherer, who had so abus'd</br>The honest people, and such harme had done;</br>Before them all, and presently begunne</br>To shew them, in what danger he had beene,</br>And of this Woolfe the cruelty and sinne;</br>How he came chang'd agen as he had prov'd:</br>Whereat the people being strangely moov'd,</br>Some on the head, some one the backe doe clape him,</br>And in their armes, with shoutes and kisses hap him:</br>Then all at once, upon the Warre-woolfe flue,</br>And up and downe him on the earth they drewe;</br>Then from his bones the flesh in Collops cut,</br>And on their weapons points in Triumph put;</br>Returning backe with a victorious song,</br>Bearing the man aloft with them along.", "Quoth Gammer Gurton, on my honest word,</br>You have told a Tale doth much conceit afford:</br>Good neighbour Howlet, and as ye have done,</br>Each one for other, since our tales begun,</br>And since our Stand of Ale, so well endures,</br>As you have moral'd Bumbyes, I will yours.</br>The fable of the War-woolfe I apply,</br>To a man, given to blood, and cruelty,</br>And upon spoile doth only set his rest;</br>Which by a wolfes shape livelyest is exprest.</br>The spring by which he gets his former shape,</br>Is the evasion after every rape,</br>He hath to start by; and the silly Asse,</br>Which unregarded, every where doth passe,</br>Is some just soule, who though the world disdaine,</br>Yet he by God is strangely made the meane,</br>To bring his damned practises to light.</br>Quoth mother Howlet you have hit the white,", "I thought as much quoth Gammer Gurton, then,</br>My turne comes next, have with you once agen.</br>A mighty Waste there in a countrey was,</br>Yet not so great as it was poore of grasse;</br>T'was said of old, a Saint once curst the soyle,</br>So barren, and so hungry, that no toyle,</br>Could ever make it any thing to beare;</br>Nor would ought prosper, that was planted there.</br>Upon the earth, the spring was seldome seene,</br>T'was winter there, when each place else was green;</br>When Summer did, her most aboundance yeild,</br>That still lay browne, as any fallow field,</br>Upon the same, some few trees scattering stood,</br>But it was Autumne, ere they us'd to bud;</br>And they were crookt, and knotty, and the leaves,</br>The niggard sap, so utterly deceives,</br>That sprouting forth, they drouping hung the head</br>And were neere withered, ere yet fully spread,</br>No mirthfull Birds, the boughes did ever grace,</br>Nor could be wonne to stay upon that place,</br>Onely the night-Crow sometimes, you might see,</br>Croking to sit upon some Ranpick-tree,</br>Which was but very seldome too, and then</br>It boded great mortality to men;</br>As were the trees, which on that common grew,</br>So were the Cattell starvelings, and a few,</br>Asses, and Mules, and they were us'd to gnaw,</br>The very earth to fill the hungry mawe;</br>When they far'd best, they fed on Fearne and brack,</br>Their leane shrunke bellyes cleav'd up to their backe,</br>Of all the rest, in that great Waste that went,</br>Of those quicke caryons, the most eminent,</br>Was a poore Mule, upon that common bred,</br>And from his foling further never fed,</br>The Summer well-neare every yeare was past,</br>Ere he his ragged winter coate could cast,</br>And then the Jade would get him to a tree,</br>That had a rough Barke, purposely, where he</br>Rubbing his Buttocks, and his either side</br>Would get the old hayre, from his starved hyde,</br>And though he were as naked as my naile,</br>Yet he would whinny then, and wag the tayle,</br>In this short pasture one day as he stood,</br>Ready to faint amongst the rest for food;</br>Yet the poore Beast according to his kinde,</br>Bearing his nostrill up into the winde,</br>A sweet fresh feeding thought that he did vent,</br>\"(Nothing as hunger sharpeneth so the sent)\"</br>For that not far there was a goodly ground,</br>Which with sweet grasse, so greatly did abound,</br>That the fat soyle seem'd to be over fraught</br>Nor could bestow the Burthen that it brought,</br>Besides that bounteous nature did it stick,</br>With sundry sorts of fragrant flowers so thick,</br>That when the warme, and Baulmy southwinde blew</br>The lushyous smells ore all the region flew.</br>Led by his sence at length this poore Jade found,</br>This pasture, (fenc'd though with a mighty Mound)</br>A pale and quickeset, Cercling it about,</br>That nothing could get in, nor nothing out)</br>And with himselfe thus wittily doth caste,</br>Well, I have found good pasture yet at last,</br>If by some meanes accomplisht it might be,</br>Round with the ditch imediatly walks he;</br>(And long though 'twas, good luck nere comes too late,)</br>It was his chance to light upon a gate</br>That led into it, (though his hap were good)</br>Yet was it made of so sufficient wood,</br>And every barre that did to it belong,</br>Was so well joynted, and so wondrous strong</br>Besides a great locke, with a double ward,</br>That he thereby of entrance was debar'd</br>And thereby hard beset, yet thought at length,</br>\"T'was done by sleight, that was not done by strength;\"</br>Fast in the ground his two fore-feete doth get,</br>Then his hard Buttockes to the gate he set,</br>And thrust, and shooke, and laboured till at last,</br>The two great posts, that held the same so fast,</br>Began to loosen, when againe he takes,</br>Fresh foot-hould, and a fresh he shakes and shakes,</br>Till the great Hindges to fly off he feeles;</br>And heard the Gate, fall clattering at his heeles,</br>Then nayes, and brayes, with such an open throat,</br>That all the Waste resounded with his note;</br>The rest that did his language understand,</br>Knew well there was, some good to them in hand,</br>And tag, and rag, through thick and thin came running,</br>Nor dale, nor ditch, nor banke nor bushes shunning;</br>And so desirous to see their good hap,</br>That with their thrunging they stucke in the gap.</br>Now they bestir their teeth, and doe devoure,</br>More sweetnesse in the compasse of one hower,</br>Then twice so many could in twice the time,</br>For now the spring was in the very prime,</br>Till prickt with plenty eas'd of all their lackes</br>Their Pampred bellies swolne above their backes</br>They tread and waddle all the goodly grasse,</br>That in the field there scarse a corner was,</br>Left free by them, and what they had not swallow'd</br>There they had dung'd, and layd them down and wallow'd;</br>One with another they would ly and play,</br>And in the deepe fog batten all the day,</br>Thus along while, this mery life they led</br>Till (even) like Lard their thickned sides were fed;</br>But on a time the weather being fayre,</br>And season fit to take the pleasant ayre,</br>To view his pasture the rich owner went,</br>And see what grasse the fruitfull yeare had sent,</br>Finding, the feeding for which he had toyld,</br>To have kept safe, by these vile cattell spoil'd,</br>He in a rage upon them sets his Cur,</br>But for his bawling, not a beast would stir;", "Then whoots, and shouts, and claps his hands, but he</br>Might as well move the dull earth, or a tree,</br>As once but stir them, when all would not doe,</br>Last, with his goad amongst them he doth goe,</br>And some of them he girdeth in the Hanches;</br>Some in the flanks, that prickt their very panches;</br>But when they felt that they began to smart,</br>Up on a suddaine they together start,</br>And drive at him as fast as they could ding,</br>They flirt, they yerk, they backward fluce, and fling,</br>As though the Devill in their heeles had bin,</br>That to escape the danger he was in,</br>He back and back, into a quagmire by,</br>Though with much perill, forced was to flye:</br>But lightly treading there-upon doth shift,</br>Out of the bog his cumbred feete to lift,</br>When they the perill that doe not fore-cast,</br>In the stiffe mud, are quickly stabled fast:</br>When to the Towne he presently doth flie,</br>Raising the Neighbours with a suddaine crie:</br>With Cords and Halters that came all at once,</br>For now the Jades were fitted for the nonce:</br>For by that time th' had sunke themselves so deepe,</br>That scarce their heads above ground they could keepe.</br>When presently they by the necks them bound,</br>And so they led them to the common pound.</br>Quoth mother Red-Cap, right well have you done</br>Good Gammer Gurton, and as we begun,</br>So you conclude:  tis time we parted now;</br>But first of my morallity alowe.</br>The common that you speake of here, say I,</br>Is nothing else but want and beggerie;</br>In the World common, and the beasts that goe</br>Upon the same, which oft are famish'd so:</br>Are the poore bred in scarcitie; the Mule</br>The other Cattell that doth seeme to rule,</br>Some crafty fellow that hath slily found</br>A way to thrive by; and the fruitfull ground</br>Is wealth, which he by subtilty doth win,</br>In his possession which not long hath bin;</br>But he with Ryot and excesse doth waste,</br>\"For goods ill gotten doe consume as fast;</br>And with the law they lastly doe contend,</br>Till at the last the Prison is the end.</br>Quoth Gammer Gurton, well your selfe you quite,</br>By this the dawne usurpt upon the night;</br>And at the windowe biddeth them good day</br>When they departed each their severall way.</br>"]
