["Tho' tempests long may toss the sea,</br>And winter make Armenia mourn;</br>Yet all its snow will melt away,</br>When Zephyr's genial gales return;</br>When birds and flowers the sullen year restore;</br>It sighs in winds, and weeps in rain, no more.", "But you, eternal mourners, you,</br>Amyntor gone where all must go,</br>With ever-streaming eyes pursue,</br>Dwell on his grave, and doat on wo;</br>Amyntor is by day the darling theme;</br>And dear Amyntor still the nightly dream.", "Yet Mordaunt dries his tears at last,</br>Tho' robb'd of all his soul's desire,</br>Ere twelve revolving moons were past,</br>The Husband once, and twice the sire:</br>His fam'd Valencia's doom in his we trace,</br>A stroke as signal in as short the space.", "Of matchless Blandford's early fate</br>The Parents now no more complain;</br>The Sisters, sunk beneath the weight</br>Of pious Sorrow, shine again,</br>Bright as the moon reflected by the tide,</br>Or you, Clemene, ere your Brother dy'd.", "Then mourn no longer, heav'nly Maid,</br>Amyntor snatch'd in Nature's prime;</br>Must Beauty too, by grief decay'd,</br>Be lost, like him, before the time?</br>Think on those eyes, and then from tears refrain;</br>Or must Philander always sue in vain?</br>"]
