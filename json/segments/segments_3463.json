["Pensive for Ireland's good, Orgoglio sate,</br>Revolving many schemes t' improve her state.</br>Near his pavilion, kept for grand parade,</br>Growling in chains a savage Tigress play'd:</br>Her shackles broke, impatient of delay,</br>The beast sprung forth to seize upon her prey:</br>But Pallas, guardian of the garter'd Knight,</br>Warn'd him to seek for safety by his flight.</br>Instant he fled; but chanc'd, in his retreat,</br>An heroine wife of Titan-blood to meet.</br>Soon as she saw his flight; &mdash; \"Oh!  Shame, she crys,</br>What recreant vision mocks Typhoea's eyes?</br>Shall it, ye Gods, in History be read,</br>My great Orgoglio from a Tigress fled?\"</br>The Chief reply'd; &mdash; \"Ah cease this haughty huff,</br>One at a time for any Knight's enough.\"</br>"]
