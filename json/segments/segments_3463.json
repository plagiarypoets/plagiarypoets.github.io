["Kind Auster!  with dissolving Breeze,</br>From Afric's warmer Regions come!</br>And back to Zembla's icy Seas</br>O!  drive thy Ruffian Brother home.&mdash;</br>Come!  and with Gales benign and bland</br>Loose from his Frosts our fetter'd Land;</br>Again O!  let the Naiads lead</br>Their Waters thro' the thirsty Mead;</br>Again with Damps prepare the tainted Ground,</br>To charm with Odours strong the rapture-breathing Hound.", "Tho' Paeon's Sons in angry Strain</br>Thy moisture-dropping Wings accuse,</br>And say Hygeia's Foes remain</br>In Ambush 'midst thy balmy Dews;</br>Say, shall not Britain's hardy Youth</br>Deny such such Dreams the Seal of Truth?</br>Who, when they wake the misty Morn</br>With Carrols blythe of Hound and Horn,</br>Find manlier Strength their active Sinews steel,</br>Than 'midst surrounding Frosts the skaiting Belgians feel.", "O!  then attend thy Suppliant's Pray'r!</br>Awhile unbend the stubborn Soil,</br>Shed thy moist Influence thro' the Air,</br>And wake again the Hunter's Toil:</br>So from each Hill, and ev'ry Grove,</br>Where'er Diana's Vot'ries rove,</br>While all around the jocund Cry</br>With mimic Thunder rends the Sky,</br>Each sportive Youth, with eager Transport pale,</br>In many a chearful Note shall bless thy friendly Gale.</br>"]
