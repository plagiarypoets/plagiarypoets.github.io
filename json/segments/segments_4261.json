["Sweet child of light, with breezes ever mild</br>And fest'ring gleams, effulgent Summer, hail!</br>In showers and quick'ning warmth,</br>With ever-bright'ning hours</br>Pour'd from the regions of eternal day,</br>Thy genial influence shed, when nature rous'd</br>By Spring's enliv'ning call</br>Has felt the vital spark,</br>And from her wint'ry slumbers wak'd apace</br>With looks benign amidst a blooming world,</br>Whose tender opening buds</br>Await thy nursive ray.</br>Let love-inspiring May, thy sweetest nymph,</br>Her flow'ry bosom spread on hill and plain,</br>And cheer the bleaken'd waste</br>With nectar-breathing bloom,</br>Which Flora rear'd with Zephyr's balmy breath.</br>&mdash;Hush'd are the storms, and through the temper'd air</br>The gloomy north breathes mild.</br>Loud tempests heave no more</br>The troubled deep, nor sweep the cheerless skies</br>With chilling winds, beneath thy gentle reign,</br>Fresh verdure decks the trees,</br>The woods and herds, the lonely wilds look gay,</br>The mountains bleat, the blooming vallies low;</br>The groves melodious sing;</br>And every voice is joy.</br>From busy noise and earth's low tangling cares,</br>Oft let me steal where contemplation reigns,</br>Unto the Muses haunt,</br>Cool grove or murmuring stream,</br>There with slow step ascend each grassy steep,</br>And gaze on Nature in her fairest forms,</br>When dews at morn or eve</br>Pour health from ev'ry flow'r,</br>Nor her Majestic wildness let me shun,</br>The hoary cliff, the sounding cataract,</br>The mountain rough and wild</br>Whose summit strikes the clouds</br>And throws projective on the neigh'bring vale</br>A broad romantic shade; oft while the swain,</br>Chear'd by the mildest ray,</br>Sits in some western height</br>And sings his love-notes to the setting sun.</br>These are the peaceful scenes Contentment loves,</br>Which charm the pensive eye,</br>And fill the soul with awe.</br>Bright season!  whose all-piercing warmth enlivens</br>Dead nature's depth, and thaws the icy pole,</br>And on the smiling earth</br>Pours forth the lengthen'd day,</br>On fruit and flow'r shed thy prolific beams;</br>That they, through Autumn's sweet nurturing hand,</br>May yield a liberal boon</br>And nourish all that live.</br>Mankind awake &mdash; Creation sing aloud&mdash;</br>To Him, who spreads the universal feast,</br>And glorious Summer breathes,</br>With gratitude and love.</br>"]
