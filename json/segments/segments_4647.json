["Celestial muse, who erst vouchsaf'dst to smile</br>On that enraptur'd bard who sung the pin</br>In nervous strains; deign now to lend thy aid</br>To one who rashly dares resume the quill;</br>Though far unequal to the lofty task,</br>To paint the noble needle's various use.", "The pin contributes to adorn the belle,</br>To add a grace and ornamental ease;</br>Or save the kerchief from the boisterous wind:</br>But more extensive far the needle yields</br>Its kind assistance to the lovely fair;</br>Its steps the justest symmetry attends,</br>And order's strictest rules its train pursue,</br>Obedient to the beauteous hand that guides.</br>How oft with heart-felt pleasure have I seen</br>The snow-white arm of Stella nimbly move</br>The pointed weapon brandish'd in her hand,</br>To pierce the tender muslin's yielding sides!</br>With pleasure too I've seen the charming maid</br>Deck'd in the garb her industry procur'd,</br>Which adds a greater lustre to the fair</br>Than ought the loit'ring toilet's use affords;</br>Whose most exalted graces, when compar'd</br>To what the needle's power bestows, are frail,</br>Nor see the sun-shine of a second day;</br>Eclips'd and dazzled by superior charms,</br>Whilst those with more refulgent splendor shine;</br>An emblem of the power of the sun!</br>Which, when it beams majestically clear,</br>Dispels the feebler rays of Cynthia's light.</br>"]
