["Again the gorgeous sun with giant force</br>Leads forth the fleeting hours that form the year,</br>And rushes onward in his flaming course</br>To that dread moment ending all things here.</br>This can I view regardless, void of fear,</br>Borne daily on his chariot wheels which roll</br>Down to the yawning grave in full career?</br>Oh!  let me ask, ere he has reach'd his goal,</br>Where shalt thou find thy final home, my soul?", "Ah!  where are they &mdash; who saw with me the sun,</br>When on the year departed, first he rose;</br>Young, vig'rous, beautiful, that the year begun,</br>But sunk into the tomb before its close?</br>If righteous Heav'n should number me with those</br>On whom the new year's sun no more shall rise,</br>Must I from hence descend to endless woes,</br>Or upward soar to share the blissful prize,</br>Where the redeem'd shall reign, with Christ beyond the skies.", "Has this world's emptiness so charm'd my heart,</br>That here, for ever, I would fondly stay;</br>Lose heav'n itself for dreams which soon depart;</br>Eternal glory, for a house of clay;</br>For gross delusions of life's transient day!&mdash;</br>O, rather let my soul, awak'ning, scorn</br>Th' infernal snare; and flee to Christ, the Way,</br>The Life, the Light; of heav'nly day, the dawn;</br>In whom, exulting thought, to die is to be born!</br>"]
