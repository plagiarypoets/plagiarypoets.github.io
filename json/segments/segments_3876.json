["Still as the source of heat and light</br>With golden beams describes the year,</br>The daemon Slav'ry takes her flight,</br>And Freedom wide dilates her sphere.</br>She to her faithful herald cries,</br>Proclaim to earth, to sea, to skies,</br>That thro' this peopled earthly ball,</br>Dear Liberty's the right of all;</br>And that the Heaven-seal'd charter Nature gave,</br>Was, MAN TO MAN SHALL NE'ER BECOME A SLAVE!", "The fetter'd Nations of the East,</br>To Britain long have turn'd their eyes,</br>Seen Independence on her crest,</br>And, like her, nobly strove to rise.</br>But to their slavish centre doom'd</br>By the dense chains of pow'r assum'd,</br>In vain the Patriot, void of dread,</br>Pierc'd by tyrannic steel, has bled,</br>And none to Freedom's glowing altar came,</br>Till France, high-favour'd, caught the British flame.", "So plainly, on the tablet vast</br>Of Nature, are our Rights engrav'd,</br>'Tis wond'rous how, in ages past,</br>Man's hapless race should be enslav'd!</br>The monster, in a Monarch's form,</br>Can neither raise nor hush the storm;</br>And, whilst he desolates a land,</br>Marks ev'ry eye &mdash; fears ev'ry hand.</br>Reigns he by right divine, say ye that can,</br>Whom guilt and terror sink beneath a man?", "Auspicious long-remembered day!</br>Thou gav'st us Liberty and Law;</br>Come, tuneful Muses!  join the lay,</br>To hail the advent of NASSAU.</br>The daughters of Olympian Jove</br>Shall Freedom's firmest guardians prove;</br>Then, aided by this potent choir,</br>Swell loud the chorus &mdash; strike the lyre.</br>The strain which fills a despot's soul with awe,</br>Shall hail great BRUNSWICK, circumscrib'd by Law.</br>"]
