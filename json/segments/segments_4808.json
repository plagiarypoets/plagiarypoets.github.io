["Oh!  goddess of celestial birth,</br>Thy magic power from heaven extend</br>To us, thy votaries of earth,</br>While suppliant at thy shrine we bend,</br>Grant us thy amaranthine joy,</br>Let no intruding grief destroy</br>The happiness that flows from thee,</br>But every passion bow, and own thy stern decree.", "When first thy vast dominion rose</br>Triumphant in the human breast,</br>Nor drear Affliction's chilling snows,</br>Nor fell Despair the mind opprest;</br>Till unto earth Pandora came,</br>Avenger of celestial flame,</br>Stolen from chariots of heaven,</br>And by Japetus' son to impious mortals given.", "But thy sweet influence remains</br>To cheer us in the gloomy vale,</br>Where Care with Melancholy reigns</br>And mortals transient Joy bewail.</br>The lingering wretch she bids revive,</br>In expectation's joy to live;</br>At her command their smiles return,</br>No more lost happiness to weep, no more to mourn.", "Attend then, Mirth, a suppliant's prayer;</br>Here let thy genial spirit rest;</br>For us thy genuine beauties wear,</br>To calm the ocean of the breast.</br>To thee our hearts we consecrate,</br>To thy decree consign our fate;</br>Our hearts to guide at thy command,</br>Own thy inspiring power, and bow beneath thy hand.</br>"]
