["Here rests his head upon the lap of earth,</br>A Curate poor, to stalls and tythes unknown;</br>No Bishop smil'd upon his humble birth,</br>No Minister e'er mark'd him for his own.", "Bread was his only food, his drink the brook;</br>So small a salary did his rector send,</br>He left his laundress all he had, a book;</br>He found in Death all he wish'd &mdash; a friend.", "No longer seek his wardrobe to disclose,</br>Nor draw his breeches from the darksome cell;</br>Here, like their master, let them find repose,</br>Nor dread the horrors of a taylor's hell.</br>"]
