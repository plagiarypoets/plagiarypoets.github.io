["My days of delight are no more,</br>Sweet moments of pleasure and peace;</br>The smile of the Morning is o'er,</br>And Night bids his horror increase.", "The landscape, which smil'd to the view,</br>When Innocence gladden'd the day;</br>The flowrets which glitter'd with dew,</br>Alas!  are alike pass'd away.", "'Twas Delia which made them look bright,</br>Her presence enlighten'd the scene;</br>Her absence had hid them in night,</br>For she of the plain was the Queen.", "Yet ah!  how severe to my mind,</br>My folly has banish'd the Fair;</br>To her merit and worthiness blind,</br>I rightly am doom'd to despair.", "Yet gentle's her bosom, I know,</br>How lovely and sweet to behold!</br>Tho' white as the fleece-fallen snow,</br>'Twas never, no, never, so cold.", "Ye nymphs, and ye shepherds, come join,</br>With me the dear charmer implore,</br>Ah!  let her again but be kind,</br>And I shall be happy once more.</br>"]
