rove</br>In the wild'ring ways of Love.</br>But HARRIET'S soft and polish'd frame</br>Only shone with Beauty's flame,</br>And conceal'd a vulgar mind,</br>Dead to every charm refin'd,</br>From Wit or

love;</br>Soft mingling with a tender sense</br>Of modesty and innocence,</br>The jocund leer, the dimpled smile,</br>And nod, and wink, replete with guile,</br>Th' inviting glance, when transport high</br>Wanton'd in her azure eye,&mdash;</br>And yet for ANNA never sigh.</br>Oft would that eye in fondness roll,</br>As by my side she sat reclin'd,</br>My arms around her waist

sported many a day,</br>Following Pleasure's transient ray,</br>And, heedless, sought the dell of Spleen;</br>Where Prudery, in gloomy pride,</br>And scowling Apathy, reside.", "Soon roaming o'er a desert dale,</br>Where never breathes the genial gale,</br>Where hemlock beds with reptiles teem</br>As moisten'd by a muddy stream,</br>And vapours rise in volumes grey,</br>Clouding the cheerful face of day;</br>By chance I spied the prudish maid</br>In snowy vestment prim array'd:</br>No flounce or fold was pinn'd awry,</br>So much she studied nicety;</br>Her jetty hair, sleek'd up behind,</br>Ne'er floated in the sportive wind,</br>Nor modest handkerchief reveal'd</br>What young coquettes scarce wish conceal'd:</br>Like them, she never knew the grace</br>Of pleasing, or the bland embrace</br>Of paramour; nay deem'd amiss</br>The side long glance, the yielding kiss.", "As I approach'd this rigid dame,</br>With fault'ring step, and shudd'ring frame;</br>On me, in sullen discontent,</br>Her grey unsparkling eye was bent:</br>Nor from her seat she deign'd to rise,</br>Nor welcome brighten'd in her eyes;</br>And looks demure, and squeamish pride,</br>The place of every smile supplied.", "But when I scornful by her past,</br>A simpering leer on me she cast,</br>Good-humour gleam'd upon her mein</br>And mingled with a glance serene;</br>While in a trim affected air,</br>Much she warn'd me to beware</br>Of Pleasure's gay enchanting wiles,</br>And young-ey'd Beauty's cheerful smiles,</br>Of winning Mirth, and Wit's sly graces,</br>And Love's unsolemniz'd embraces;</br>Then much she talk'd of Virtue's power</br>To guard us in th' impassion'd hour,</br>Of Prudence, and of Friendship's flame,</br>And meek Reserve, and virgin Shame,</br>And Chastity's dear honour'd name.", "Wearied with Prudery's fretful tale,</br>On a bank as I repos'd</br>Amide the solitary vale,</br>Dewy Sleep my eye-lids clos'd.</br>Descending from the climes of light,</br>Anon
