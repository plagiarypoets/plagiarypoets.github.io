["\"Full many an hour with tardy flight</br>Has wandered o'er my head,</br>And many a day hath set in night,</br>And many a month has fled,</br>Since Britain's lov'd, lamented land,</br>Evanish'd from my view:</br>Since last I prest my Chloe's hand,</br>And bade her soft adieu!</br>But now upon my raptur'd eye</br>Extends the long lost isle,</br>And Chloe's lovely form is nigh,</br>With fond affection's smile.</br>Ah me!  what woes were mine to prove,</br>When far from genial skies,</br>When absent from the voice of love,</br>I saw the tempest rise:</br>Yet then amid the awful shade</br>That veil'd the gloomy sky,</br>What time the dreadful whirlwind play'd,</br>My Chloe's form was nigh:</br>'Twas thine the voice of hope to pour</br>Upon my weary breast;</br>What time the lightning's lurid blaze</br>Illum'd the rolling sea;</br>I fled to future brighter days</br>And fix'd my heart on thee;</br>Yet now and then a tender sigh</br>Arose from doubtful fear,</br>And from my fondly anxious eye</br>Distill'd the pensive tear.</br>But when the stormy scenes subside,</br>When quiet rul'd the seas,</br>When the sun trembled on the tide</br>That murmur'd in the breeze:</br>Then in the calm unruffled hour,</br>From every tumult free,</br>I own'd affections fondest pow'r,</br>And dwelt alone on thee;</br>And oft when Cynthia from her throne</br>Amidst the azure plain,</br>With softest mildest lustre shone</br>And slept upon the main.</br>While memory fill'd my faithful mind</br>And bade her visions throng,</br>I heav'd my passion to the wind</br>In many a pensive song;</br>Oft then thy tender form was seen</br>In fancy's anxious sight,</br>To smile upon the wave serene,</br>And chase the gloom of night:</br>Thy accents seem'd my ear to meet</br>And gently die away,</br>In notes with melody replete,</br>And soft as Cynthia's ray.</br>Thus have I past the lingering hours</br>While absent from thy smile,</br>While absent from Britannia's bow'rs,</br>Upon the deeps to toil;</br>But now upon my raptur'd sight</br>Britannia's hills are seen,</br>And gentle Chloe with delight</br>Inspires the future scene.\"", "Thus pour'd Palemon his soft strain,</br>As near the rock they steer'd:</br>Nor ever dreamt of future pain,</br>Nor future sorrow fear'd;</br>When sudden to the wand'ring eye</br>Along the heaving main,</br>The cutter spread her sails on high,</br>And march'd the wat'ry plain:</br>They saw the savage gang appear,</br>And trembled at the view:</br>The pensive scene of grief was near,</br>And pleasure bade adieu!</br>Confin'd within the tender dear,</br>He mourn'd the hours along,</br>And pour'd of frantic woe the tear,</br>The weeping waves among.</br>No more he dreams of scenes of joy,</br>Of prospects now decay'd:</br>The pleasures that of late were nigh,</br>In stern affliction fade.", "\"Adieu!\"  he said, \"to Chloe's smile&mdash;</br>For Chloe's smile no more</br>Shall tedious hours or days beguile,</br>On Britain's long lost shore!</br>And can you thus, ye sons of wrong,</br>The innocent betray:</br>But, ah!  my griefs will not be long,</br>For life declines away.</br>Ah!  must the gentle peaceful soul</br>Be torn from tranquil plains,</br>To where the warring thunders roll,</br>Where desolation reigns?</br>Let those who love the scenes of death,</br>In scenes of battle fall:</br>Nor bear away the peaceful breath,</br>That wishes well to all.\"", "He said &mdash; and o'er his youthful form</br>A sickly paleness play'd;</br>And death &mdash; that hover'd in the storm</br>Now spreads his gloomy shade.", "\"Adieu ye scenes!\"  he mournful cry'd&mdash;</br>Where once unknown to care,</br>With gentle Chloe at my side,</br>I pass'd the moments fair!</br>And thou, for whom I live and breathe,</br>Adieu my Chloe dear!</br>Oh!  twine for me the willow wreathe,</br>And shed for me the tear!</br>Oft wander to my grave alone,</br>When Cynthia spreads her ray:</br>And breathe the tender pensive moan,</br>And sigh the hours away.</br>'Till death unite, with friendly hand,</br>In regions far above;</br>And join us in the joyful land</br>Of everlasting  love.\"", "He said &mdash; and death with pointed dart</br>Erected high his crest,</br>And deep he pierc'd the fainting heart,</br>And freed the tortur'd breast!</br>Oh shame to Britain!  in thy land</br>Shall such a crew remain,</br>Who lawless in thy regions stand</br>The \"Ministers of pain.\"</br>When time has brought the wish'd for day,</br>And Britain's hills are near;</br>Ah!  is it not &mdash; ye tyrants say,</br>Ah!  is it not severe,</br>To think that he, who doom'd to roam</br>For many months the sea,</br>At last should be deny'd his home</br>And dearer friends to see?</br>And borne relentless from the plain,</br>From peace and pleasure far,</br>To meet affliction's dreadful train</br>Amidst the rage of war!</br>Oh think!  what countless numbers mourn,</br>And bid their tears to flow,</br>For friends that never must return</br>To check the tide of woe!</br>The streams that in the battle flow,</br>Lie heavy on your heart;</br>And S****  shall feel the tenfold blow</br>When death extends his dart.</br>For never yet a cruel deed</br>Unpunish'd past away;</br>But virtue has a glorious meed</br>In everlasting day.</br>"]
