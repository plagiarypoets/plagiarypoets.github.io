["How blythe, and how gay were the flowers,</br>When Colin appear'd on the green;</br>The blossoms burst forth in the bowers,</br>To heighten, and gladden the scene.", "The birds were all perch'd on the sprays,</br>They crouded around in a throng,</br>Twas Colin inspir'd their lays,</br>His goodness invited their song.", "No shepherd complain'd that his fleece,</br>Was ravish'd, or taken by fraud;</br>The vines were all cultur'd in peace,</br>The flocks never rambled abroad.", "His cottage was Charity's home,</br>Soft Sympathy sat in the door,</br>Inviting the orphans to come,</br>And dealing out bread to the poor.", "How sad in reverse is the gloom,</br>What tributes of sorrow are paid;</br>Ye shepherds, come weep on the tomb,</br>Where Colin the generous is laid.", "New laurels forever shall spring,</br>From Gratitude incense shall rise;</br>Chaste Memory, rich honours shall bring,</br>To mark out the place where he lies.</br>"]
