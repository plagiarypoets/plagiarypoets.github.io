["It is the twilight hour:</br>There is no breath upon the air to break</br>The silvery veil that floats o'er earth's wan cheek;</br>Day hath departed like the dream</br>That draws the poet's sighs,</br>And left behind the shadow and the gleam</br>From those far gates which close on Paradise!</br>Now fairy elves have power;</br>And the light gossamer on the deep of air</br>Hangs her fine film &mdash; for all is silent there!</br>The Spirit of Love descendeth from her heaven,</br>And sinks in the full heart to rapture given,</br>Like dew upon the flower.", "It is the twilight hour:</br>The hues of feeling, life, and love are fled;</br>Like Beauty's cheek her breath of roses shed!</br>The soul with tenderness o'erflows</br>By its own joy oppressed:</br>The calm, the fragrance round deep languor throws,</br>Raising vain dreams of passion and of rest,</br>The fond heart's hopeless dower.</br>All are in sleep, or in that breathlessness</br>When tranced love pauses ere again it bless;</br>The dewy star looks forth in light above,</br>The maiden only sighing for her love,</br>Sits in her lonely bower!", "It is the twilight hour:</br>Heaven's deepest azure opens round on high,</br>Veiling behind unknown eternity:</br>The dews of evening steal upon</br>The senses' saddened mood,</br>Soft as the memories of music gone;</br>The flowers, the dim flowers bend their heads subdued,</br>And drink the ethereal shower.</br>Earth fades in mystery, and the deepening gloom</br>Folds o'er her like the shadow of the tomb:</br>Night draws her starred tiara on her brow,</br>And Darkness gathers round the world &mdash; and now</br>Farewell the twilight hour!</br>"]
