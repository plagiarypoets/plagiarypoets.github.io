["Though my flocks range o'er pastures of Peace,</br>Crop rich herbage, and quaff the clear stream,</br>Oft my pipe's too gay carols I cease,</br>With a sigh &mdash; that their bliss is a dream.", "Cruel man!  Ought it not to suffice</br>That beneath their warm fleeces you glow,</br>While the food is lock'd up by the ice,</br>And themselves are half buried in snow?", "Who can hear, without anguish, the lambs,</br>As shiv'ring they bleat in the cold?</br>Who can see the distress of their dams,</br>And such fondness unweeping behold?", "When I think that fell slaughter, ere long,</br>Their dear innocent bosoms must stain,</br>With my griefs I soon finish the song,</br>Meant at first to enliven the plain.</br>"]
