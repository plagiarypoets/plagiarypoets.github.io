["Ye shepherds so careless and gay,</br>Who sport with the nymphs of the plain,</br>Take heed lest you frolic away</br>The peace you can never regain.</br>Let not Folly your bosoms annoy;</br>And of Love, the dear mischief, beware.</br>You may think 'tis all sunshine and joy,</br>&mdash;I know 'tis o'ershadow'd with care.", "Love's morning how blithsome it shines,</br>With an aspect deceitfully fair;</br>Its day oft in sorrow declines,</br>And it sets in the night of despair.</br>Hope paints the gay scene to the sight,</br>While Fancy her visions bestows,</br>And gilds ev'ry dream with delight,</br>But to wake us to sensible woes.", "How hard is my lot to complain</br>Of a nymph whom I yet must adore,</br>Tho' she love not her shepherd again,</br>Her DAMON must love her the more.</br>For it was not the pride of her sex,</br>That treated his vows with disdain,</br>For it was not the pleasure to vex,</br>That made her delude her fond swain.", "'Twas His, the fair Nymph to behold,</br>He hop'd &mdash; and he rashly believ'd.</br>'Twas her's to be fatally cold;</br>&mdash;He lov'd &mdash; and was fondly deceiv'd.</br>For such is of lovers the doom,</br>While passions their reason beguile,</br>'Tis warrant enough to presume,</br>If they catch but a look or a smile.", "Yet surely my PHYLLIS would seem</br>To prize me most shepherds above;</br>But that might be only esteem,</br>While I foolishly constru'd it love.</br>Yet others, like DAMON, believ'd</br>The nymph might have favour'd her swain,</br>And others, like Him, were deceiv'd,</br>Like Him, tho' they cannot complain.", "Of PHYLLIS was always my song,</br>For she was my pride and my care;</br>And the folks, as we wander'd along,</br>Wou'd call us the conjugal pair.</br>They mark'd how I walk'd at her side,</br>How her hand to my bosom I prest,</br>Each tender endearment I try'd,</br>And I thought none was ever so blest.", "But now the delusion is o'er,</br>These day-dreams of pleasure are fled,</br>Now Her DAMON is pleasing no more,</br>And the hopes of her shepherd are dead.</br>May he that my fair shall obtain,</br>May He, as thy DAMON, be true;</br>Or haply thou'lt think of that swain,</br>Who bids thee, dear maiden, adieu.</br>"]
