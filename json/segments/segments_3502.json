["To thee sweet nymph, nymph of the jocund eye,</br>And coral lip, and laughter dimpled cheek,</br>Say, shall I raise the song,</br>The song in tribute thine.</br>As erst when favour'd by the kindly smiles,</br>Health, ruddy health strung ev'ry youthful nerve,</br>And by yon rushy brook</br>I sung of health and thee.</br>Say, shall I seek thee in the dark'ning shade</br>Of length'n'd branching oaks, or hamlet brown,</br>Or upland dewy dale,</br>Brushing the dews away.</br>'Tis thine I know to wind the ecchoing horn,</br>Curb the fleet steed, or urge the hardy chace,</br>Or at the 'custom'd round</br>Prepare the sylvan treat.</br>'Tis thine to wander by the babbling rills,</br>Piping to list'ning swains the Doric reed,</br>Sweet reed, whose melting sounds</br>To virtue charm the soul.</br>Nor less 'tis thine in sacred rites enthron'd,</br>Far from the groups of loudly laughing mirth,</br>Far from the revel hauts</br>Of wildly wanton maids;</br>Such as where Venus with disorder'd vest</br>And breathing zone, leads up the am'rous dance,</br>And mad with swelling lust</br>Sucks the lewd Tuscan grape.</br>Yes, far from thee, these nightly vigils keep</br>In riot drunk, while o'er thy homely couch</br>Transported Hymen smiles,</br>Dilating joy heav'n-born.</br>Nor care is thine save nature's infant care,</br>The beauteous hopeful progeny of love,</br>Which lisp content, or vie</br>To meet the envied kiss.</br>Thine is no dread, unknown is horrid war,</br>Her loud shrill trumpet brac'd with sounding death,</br>And conflagrating clash</br>Of host to host oppos'd;</br>Thine, lovely maid, thine is the peaceful state,</br>The good old Saturn and our fathers sway'd,</br>'Ere the inhuman forge</br>Labour'd with monstrous birth,</br>'Ere war'd with impious and gigantic force</br>The daring Titans 'gainst the sons of Jove,</br>Scaling on hills and rocks</br>The empyreal heav'nly walls.</br>Thine lovely maid, thine is the peaceful state,</br>For man first destin'd when that man was pure,</br>Pure and unstain'd, and form'd</br>Bright image of the gods.</br>Then heav'ns fair sons oft left their starry thrones</br>Familiar, with his pleasing converse pleas'd,</br>Chaunting in measures sweet</br>The consecrated hymn.</br>By thee thus seated, and like him compos'd,</br>Eager and early with the dappl'd morn</br>O let me prostrate fall,</br>And breathe the incens'd pray'r.</br>Then to the chace and vigorous exercise</br>(For rosy ruddy health's the child of toil)</br>My Spartan hounds convene,</br>And mount the fav'rite steed;</br>Or in the spiry shade or shadowy grot,</br>At noon secreted from the solar heats,</br>In meditation wrapt</br>O let, O let me stray;</br>At eve with thee I'll tune the oaten stop,</br>Or wooing nature, mark her various pow'rs,</br>The ebb, the flow of tides,</br>And change of night and day,</br>And Spring with tresses bath'd in April tears,</br>Summer with sun-beat face, and Autumn kind,</br>The youngest, far the best</br>Of all the seasons fair.</br>Hence taught from nature's simple page, I draw</br>More than voluminous learning ever taught,</br>Or whilome feign'd by Greece,</br>Or Egypt's mystic lore.</br>Then lead, chaste goddess, to that blest recluse,</br>Where reason, science, friendship, rose-lip'd health,</br>The pastimes soft regale</br>And lull to calm repose.</br>And where sweet youth, sweet care, contentment sweet,</br>And all to virtue, love, and peace allied,</br>Gay in immortal spring</br>Confess thy bounteous hand.</br>"]
