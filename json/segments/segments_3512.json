["To you, ye Rustics of the present Age,</br>In life's low vale, I dedicate my page;</br>Sworn foe to Pride, and every selfish aim,</br>A shepherd lad &mdash; he seeks no better name:</br>With hat in hand presents his rural lays,</br>And begs your patronage and honest praise.", "When fair forfoghten at the weary pleugh,</br>Or at the harrow, fasht an' tir'd enough;</br>At e'en their sangs may hap to gie ye sport,</br>An' help to gar the weary hour seem short,</br>If ye, perusing, ay when ye're at leisure,</br>Reap in the reading, e'en but ha'f the pleasure,</br>That I, in writing by mysel', enjoy'd;</br>Or in the field, or by the Ingle side;</br>Ye'll far frae think, I ween, your minutes lost,</br>But smiling read &mdash; despising care an' cost.", "Destructive critics!  thrawart, gloomy kaes!</br>For Heaven's sake &mdash; O!  squint not o'er my lays!</br>No! &mdash; never, with such stuff, your fingers file,</br>(For this plain reason) &mdash; 'tis not worth your while.</br>For you I write not &mdash; 'tis the' unletter'd swains,</br>My gay coevals, on our northern plains,</br>Whose humble wishes ne'er inclin'd to stray</br>Beyond their hawthorn scenes, and russet gray.</br>"]
