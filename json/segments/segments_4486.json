["Melancholy, mournful maid!</br>Seeker of the silent shade,</br>Foe to empty noise and strife,</br>Lover of a lonely life!</br>Come, lov'd Nymph, with me to dwell</br>In dreary waste, or midnight cell!</br>Come to one who courts thy charms,</br>Equal foe to vain alarms.</br>Ever welcome here to rest,</br>Weep recumbent on my breast;</br>Where indulg'd, and free from fear,</br>Discontent and deep Despair,</br>Companions of the silent tear,</br>All await thy coming here.</br>We'll attend thy moonlight walks,</br>Where the pensive Spectre stalks;</br>O'er the mansions of the dead,</br>Where Ambition droops her head;</br>Thro' rows of elms, or ancient oaks,</br>Where the ominous raven croaks,</br>Or mournful nightingale complains</br>To shady woods and silent plains;</br>In the peaceful, gloomy grove,</br>Where the branches gently move,</br>Or, if tempted o'er the dew,</br>We'll thy lonely steps pursue,</br>When the moon's reflected beam</br>Silvers o'er the sylvan scene;</br>While the grass-born insect hops,</br>Feeding on the pearly drops;</br>And the dogs affrighted howl</br>At the shrill foreboding owl;</br>Then, in some sequester'd bow'r</br>Retir'd, enjoy a pensive hour.</br>"]
