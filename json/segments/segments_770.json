["Accept, O sacred Shade, this artless Verse,</br>And kindly, O ye mourning Friends, forbear,</br>To dear disdaining from his decent Herse,</br>All I can give except the tender Tear:</br>He must not lie in his cold Grave, among</br>Poor shrieking Ghosts, unprais'd, unwept, unsung.", "Ah!  where was I when fiercely-frowning Death,</br>With brandisht Dart stood at still Midnight nigh,</br>Why came I not to catch thy dying Breath,</br>And close with trembling Hand thy languid Eye?</br>And on my sad Breast lay thy drooping Head,</br>And bath with Tears thy Hand so cold and dead?", "Thee do I view in yonder flying Cloud,</br>Or do I hear thee in the hollow Wind,</br>Or dost thou still sleep in thy sable Shroud,</br>Where the dread Judgment-Trumpet Thee shall find:</br>O till that Day, ye pitying Angels come,</br>Shield with your Wings, and sing around his Tomb.", "But if advanc'd to Heav'n's empyreal Height,</br>Above with glorious martyr'd Saints to live,</br>'Midst heav'nly Hymns, and Harps, and Visions bright,</br>And all the Joys a smiling God can give;</br>O be my watchful Guardian Angel still,</br>Save me from slavish Vice, from Folly, and from Ill.</br>"]
