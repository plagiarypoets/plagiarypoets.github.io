["O gentle Bard!  full much I wonder</br>Why you should quote this son of thunder;</br>Not more amaz'd to cast my eye on</br>A tailor flirting with a lion!</br>Whether you gravely write, or gaily,</br>You're still the gentle Mr. &mdash;,</br>In style prosaic tagg'd with rhyme,</br>Monstrously flat and unsublime,</br>Which sometimes buckrams into rant</br>By aid of sentimental cant;</br>Such as reminds us of the plan</br>Of Harvey and of Bunyan.</br>With Mason Mr. H. glories</br>In metaphysic allegories,</br>Where words which prose-men term abstract,</br>By epithets are made to act;</br>Compell'd on their reluctant duties,</br>And Spenser's faults are H.'s duties.</br>"]
