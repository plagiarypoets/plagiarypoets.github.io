["Ah Chloe!  reject not my pray'r,</br>Tho' simple and aukward my strain,</br>I'll answer 'tis full as sincere</br>As any that visit the plain.", "They all with assurance can meet</br>The glances that dart from your eye;</br>They all can with elegance greet</br>The voice that attunes them to joy.", "Yet why should my fair-one despise,</br>The bashful reserve of her swain?</br>He cannot resist her bright eyes,</br>He cannot reply to her strain.", "When he fain would with fluency speak,</br>And view with his fellows so gay,</br>His heart seem'd with throbbing to break,</br>His tremulous voice dies away.", "They banter the blushes that rise,</br>When I see her advance on the plain;</br>And she too in secret enjoys</br>The merriment made at my pain.", "They approach her with ease in their mien,</br>They address'd her in phrases polite,</br>And Chloe seems proud to be seen,</br>For their flatt'ry gives her delight.", "Yet think not that shepherd e'er loves,</br>Who courts in an elegant strain;</br>He most his sincerity proves</br>Who least can his passion explain.</br>"]
