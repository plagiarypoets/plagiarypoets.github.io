["The Swains and the Virgins so gay</br>Resort to my fountains and groves;</br>Joy follows wherever they stray,</br>And my vales seem the Court of the Loves.", "But with wonder they mark me forlorn,</br>'Mid fountains and valleys so fair&mdash;</br>Ah!  their hearts have no reason to mourn,</br>Nor to heave the sad sigh of despair.", "To love, and be not lov'd again,</br>Is a curse that embitters each hour;</br>Then dull are the songs of the plain,</br>And faded the blooms of the bower!", "But with her who will smile on our sighs,</br>Even rocks of the Desert must bloom,</br>Pale Night be a Sun to our eyes,</br>And the Dungeon depriv'd of its gloom!</br>"]
