["Why when the storm is up, and winds are loud,</br>And the hoarse heavy torrent dashes down,</br>Why seems my spirit joyful and unbowed,</br>Why am I oppressed by Nature's frown?</br>Is it because in my seared heart hath grown</br>Strange sympathy with tempest and with gloom?</br>Or is it that when joy was most my own</br>That joy no heavenly radiance did illume,</br>And even when brightest seemed to breathe but of the tomb?", "Even as the war-note to the warrior's ear,</br>Comes with a full and spirit-stirring charm,</br>So comes to mine, even when most severe,</br>And when most fit the feeble to alarm;</br>So comes to mine, as if devoid of harm,</br>Approaching winter's wild and wayward blast!</br>And though I love the summer's gentle calm,</br>Yet all so darkly hath my fate been cast,</br>I hail more fondly still the storm-encircled waste.</br>"]
