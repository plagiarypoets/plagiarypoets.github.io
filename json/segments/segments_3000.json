["To thee, sweet maid!  serenely mild&mdash;</br>To thee, fair Nature's sportive child&mdash;</br>Sweet Cheerfulness!  in humble lays,</br>I tune my reed to sing thy praise!</br>Where'er my roving steps I bend,</br>Do thou, blithe nymph, my path attend;</br>And choose for me that fair retreat,</br>Which thou hast made thy blissful seat;&mdash;</br>With thee and Health, (thrice happy band!)</br>Content shall join us hand in hand;</br>And, as together oft we stray,</br>With fresh-cull'd roses strew the way;</br>Such as fair Nature's hands bestow,</br>And with luxuriant beauty blow;</br>While zephyrs waft the fragrant scent</br>To the bless'd home of sweet Content:</br>There Mirth without restraint resides,</br>And o'er each happy hour presides:</br>Tho' small my hut, and coarse my fare,</br>Still all is bless'd if thou art there;</br>Such pleasures will attend my fate,</br>I'll envy not the pompous great,</br>Who only seek for wealth and fame,</br>And only know thee as a name.", "Then let me fly the giddy court,</br>And to the cheerful groves resort;</br>And, as I move in verdant bow'rs,</br>Be thou companion of my hours:</br>'Mid beauteous nymphs and happy swains,</br>In peaceful woods, o'er fertile plains;</br>Where mountains with the sunbeams glow,</br>And limpid streams meand'ring flow;</br>There ruddy Health shall blithe advance,</br>And lead me to the mazy dance:</br>Thou, Cheerfulness, in simple vest</br>Of innocence, so sweetly drest,</br>Shalt sprightly tune the sportive lay,</br>And with thy presence crown the day.</br>When early breaks the roseate morn,</br>What glowing tints thy cheeks adorn!</br>Thy garb bespangled o'er with dew,</br>Thy eyes of Heaven's etherial blue!</br>So fair thy form, so blithe thy mien,</br>Great goddess of the sylvan scene!", "If cares disturb the tranquil hour,</br>How sure thy aid, how soft thy pow'r;</br>How sweet the solace you impart,</br>When sorrow wounds the feeling heart!</br>Without thee all is chill and drear,</br>But Nature smiles shouldst thou appear:</br>November's gloom we scarce perceive,</br>If thou but cheer the winter's eve.</br>When frosts and chilling winds congeal,</br>And snows the mountain-tops conceal;</br>When wildly blows the piercing blast,</br>And Heav'n's bright azure storms o'ercast;</br>When lightning's vivid flashes glare,</br>Or thunders dire convulse the air,&mdash;</br>Thy presence shall my bosom warm,</br>And shield me from the pelting storm.</br>Then deign with me to be a guest,</br>And ev'ry season shall be blest:</br>If such the happiness you bring,</br>'Twill change dull Winter's reign to Spring.</br>"]
