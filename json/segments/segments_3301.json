["SIR W. PULTENEY.</br>An uncouth Savage and uncivill Wight,</br>Of griesly hue, and foul, ill-favour'd sight;</br>And in his lap a mass of Coine he told,</br>And turned upside down, to feed his eye</br>And covetous desire with his huge treasury;</br>And round about him lay on every side</br>Great Hopes of Gold &mdash; that NEVER could be spent!", "MR. PITT.</br>And, like a crane, his neck was long and fine,</br>With which he swallow'd up excessive feast,</br>For want whereof poor People oft did pine!</br>In green Vine-leaves he was right fitly clad&mdash;</br>For other clothes he could not wear for heat;</br>Still as he rode he somewhat did eat,</br>And in his hand did bear a bouzing Cann.</br>Unfit he was for any wordly thing,</br>And eke unable once to stir or go;</br>Not meet to be a Counsel to a King,</br>Whose mind in Meat and Drink was drowned so.</br>Full of Disease was his carcass blue,</br>And a dry Dropsie thro' his flesh did flow!", "MR. DUNDAS.</br>And next to him sate goodly Shamefacedness;</br>Ne ever durst his eyes from ground upreare&mdash;</br>Ne ever once did look up from his dress,</br>As if some blame of evill he did fear,</br>That in his cheek made Roses oft appear.", "GEORGE ROSE.</br>&mdash;Down hanging his dull head&mdash;</br>Yet inly being more than seemly sad;</br>A pair of Pincers in his hand he had</br>With which he pinched People to the heart.", "MR. WILBERFORCE.</br>Where that Old Woman day and night did pray</br>Upon her Beades, devoutly penitent;</br>Nine hundred Pater-nosters every day</br>And thrice nine hundred Aves she was wont to say!", "And, to augment her painful Penance more,</br>Thrice every week in Ashes she did sit,</br>And with her loothsome skin rough Sackcloth wore,</br>And THRICE THREE TIMES did fast from ev'ry Bit.</br>"]
