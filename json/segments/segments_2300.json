["Thou art in every place, Being Supreme!</br>Best seen and worship'd, in thy court above,</br>Yet here on earth thy countenance doth beam</br>With rays of terror, majesty, and love,</br>And joys unspeakable thy smile do move;</br>And none may veil him from thy piercing sight,</br>Escape thine hand, or from thy presence rove;</br>Or hide in secret cells close wrapt in night,</br>For unto thee the darkness shineth as the light.", "Thou dwellest where the curtain'd whirlwinds hide;</br>Where the arm'd thunder walks his lofty round;</br>Thou on the tempest of the night dost ride,</br>Flames mark thy path, and clouds thy car surround,</br>And mighty winds are rous'd, and surging billows sound,</br>While from thine eye the winged lightnings part;</br>Thou in the highest arch of Heaven art found;</br>In the dark regions of the earth thou art,</br>And in the humble mansion of the contrite heart.", "With fear I bow me at thine awful seat;</br>How to thy holy presence dare I press!</br>But hark; a voice celestial seems to meet</br>My waiting ear, and my intrusion bless,</br>\"Spread before me your wants and your distress,</br>Upon mine arm of strength your burdens cast,</br>An intercessor fills the holy place.\"</br>I come; the hour of terror now is past,</br>I trust thou wilt not leave me comfortless at last.", "Oh!  if the storms of life with bitter rage,</br>Upon my sad, unshelter'd head should blow,</br>If trembling down the cold, dark steep of age,</br>My weak and unsupported step should go,</br>My heart all sunk with weariness and woe,</br>Or wheresoe'er my unknown path shall tend,</br>Still let my bosom at thy presence glow,</br>Still let my ceaseless prayers to thee ascend,</br>And ever to my wants thy kind compassion lend.</br>"]
