["Rest from your race of glory!  sleep in peace,</br>Monarchs of other days!  Thou, hallow'd shrine,</br>Let not Oblivion's hand these Reliques seize,</br>These holier Reliques of the Briton-line.", "Rest!  O ye Monarchs of the Western main,</br>That won the laurel, and that wore the plume:</br>O rest!  'till God's own harbinger again</br>Shall rouze the sacred tenant of the tomb.", "Here fell the grave, the gay, firm friends and foes,</br>Soft virgins charms that merited the tear;</br>Here sleep the sages, and the saints repose;</br>Here rests the martyr, and the monarch here.", "Yet, what remains to mark a Monarch's frame?</br>The crumbling features of the mimic bust;</br>The rough, rude records of sepulchral Fame,</br>Earth, giv'n to earth, and into dust the dust!", "Are these the trophies of the Kings of Men?</br>These the sole records of the sons of war?</br>The artist's chizzel, or historian's pen,</br>The frail memorial, and the sculptur'd car?", "Claims but the patriot, who his life-blood lost,</br>The cold rewards of monumental praise?</br>Or does the Prince, or Prelate, idly boast</br>The Mitre's radiance, and Tiara's blaze?", "Does the lorn lover in the gloomy fane</br>Court the cold busto in the cloister'd shade?</br>Or woo, with anguish, and complainings vain,</br>Th' ungenial bosom of the marble maid?", "Say, does the martyr, that can bleed no more,</br>But in those brief and narrow confines lie?</br>Or is the Saints' high, delegated pow'r</br>But mould'ring dust, and frail anatomy?", "Saints, whose warm embers 'gainst Heav'n's Chancery hurl'd,</br>Bow'd the meek head, and bent the suppliant knee,</br>Died, &mdash; like the Saviour of a sinking world,</br>And, \"sunk in silent agony,\" for thee!</br>"]
