["When FANNY first chaunts in the ecchoing grove,</br>The virgins all hasten around,</br>The swains leave their flocks in the vallies to rove,</br>And with rapture attend to the sound!", "Late I heard her an air with such accents repeat,</br>As we walk'd the green meadows along;</br>That the notes through my breast thrill'd enchantingly sweet</br>My heart beating time to her song!", "Nor less in the Nymph the endowments we trace,</br>Of sense, and of manners refin'd;</br>The Loves and the Graces, all sport in her face,</br>And the virtues are lodg'd in her mind!", "What transports, what permanent pleasures await,</br>The youth who shall call her his own!</br>He may view from a cot without envy, the state</br>Of the happiest Prince on a throne!", "For me, in each village how great were my fame!</br>How much would the Shepherd rejoice!</br>Could the verse, that recites her just praises, but claim,</br>To be sung by her ravishing voice!</br>"]
