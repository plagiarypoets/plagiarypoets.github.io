["Come, thou laughter-loving power,</br>Goddess of the festive hour,</br>Blue-eyed Mirth, and bring along</br>Gamesome Sport, and jocund Song.</br>Wit with native Humour warm,</br>Conversation's lively charm,</br>And yet more, to ope the soul,</br>Bring, O bring the jovial bowl;</br>Let us lift the gladsome shout,</br>Let us wake the midnight rout,</br>Briskly let us all advance</br>In the sprightly-woven dance;</br>Every deed on every side</br>Let the soul of rapture guide:</br>Care begone!  and Grief adieu!</br>What have ye with Joy to do?</br>And thou too, that lov'st to dwell</br>Musing in the pensive cell,</br>Heavenly queen of piercing eye,</br>Farewell, sweet Philosophy!</br>What if thou, with hermit-look,</br>From retirement's farthest nook,</br>Mark'st the world, in bustling show,</br>Struggling o'er the waves of woe,</br>By the wind of black Despair</br>Dash'd away from care to care,</br>Whilst thou, calm on safety's shore,</br>Dost but hear the tempest roar.</br>What if thou the flowery pride</br>Of the meadow's velvet side,</br>To the proudly-arching bower,</br>And the glittering court of power,</br>Can'st prefer; we envy not,</br>Holy seer, thy simple lot.</br>Sisters twin are Youth and Pleasure,</br>Meant t' enjoy the sweets of leisure,</br>Made for every blithsome sport,</br>Purpose mild, and gay resort.</br>Age was form'd for meditation,</br>Not the toys of recreation,</br>With the smiles of wisdom fraught,</br>And the glow of solemn thought;</br>Such is Age, Philosophy,</br>Such the mind that suits with thee.", "But now joys of different kind</br>Wing the wish, and fire the mind;</br>Tumbling rills that warbling flow,</br>Yellow meads with gold that glow,</br>Wandering walks, and rural ease,</br>Such alone have power to please:</br>Or perchance the lucid scene,</br>Where the rays of beauty's mien,</br>Kindling every fond desire,</br>Set the soul of Love on fire:</br>Or the loudly-echoing horn,</br>As it cheers the slumbering morn,</br>Waking nature, haply may</br>Lure us to the chace away.", "Farewell then, thou willow'd stream,</br>Glittering bright with wisdom's beam,</br>Silver Cam!  whose bowers among</br>Inspiration leads her throng,</br>Clio breathes celestial fire,</br>Music hangs her dulcet lyre,</br>Yet farewell! &mdash; To brighter joys</br>Pleasure lifts our wandering eyes,</br>With her own resistless smile</br>She shall smooth each care awhile;</br>Yes, she, fair queen, shall all the mind possess,</br>With gladness fire it, and with rapture bless.</br>"]
