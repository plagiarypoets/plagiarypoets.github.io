["Is this the dwelling of imperial pride!</br>Are these the glories of immortal Rome?</br>Did pomp and power within these walls reside?</br>Where are the courts, the towers, the gilded dome?</br>See!  lizards start, where kings had once their home;</br>And statue, arch, and column rudely whirled,</br>Scoff at the wild enthusiast who can roam,</br>And find in loathsome vaults, and ruins hurled</br>Age after age &mdash; \"the golden mansion of the world!\"", "Ah!  little did they dream, who reared yon pile,</br>That creeping ivy on its top should grow;</br>That she whose empire, from the Northern Isle</br>To where old Atlas lifts his burning brow,</br>O'er myriad nations swept &mdash; should be as now,</br>When young barbarians from an unknown shore&mdash;</br>Pilgrims of freedom &mdash; wander here to bow</br>At her still sacred altar &mdash; to explore</br>What ruthless time has left &mdash; to wonder and deplore.", "Yet, even in those days of boundless power,</br>Prophetic visions hovered o'er the sight</br>Of one illustrious sage &mdash; he saw the hour,</br>The sure, though distant hour, when all the light</br>Of beauty, genius, science &mdash; all the might</br>And glory of ambition unrepressed,</br>Should, from their eastern cradle, wing their flight</br>To climes, by dreaming poets called the blest,</br>The unseen &mdash; the yet unknown &mdash; ATLANTIS of the west.", "That there, 'mid circling hills and cloudless skies,</br>The muse again should dwell &mdash; new arts should vie,</br>The breathing marble, and the varied dyes,</br>To nature strongly true:  than these, more high,</br>Triumphant virtue, fame that may defy</br>Time's withering touch, and freedom boldly gained</br>As in Rome's day of glory, ah!  gone by,</br>And &mdash; not as then, by vice, ambition, stained&mdash;</br>Long should they dwell with thee, ATLANTIS!  unprofaned.</br>"]
