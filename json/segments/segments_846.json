["Fiction has sung that in the wild</br>Desarted Una lay,</br>Whose eyes could look e'en Tygers mild,</br>Whose voice made Wolves obey.", "The painter caught the poet's fire&mdash;</br>And Tygers, sporting mild,</br>With Wolves, in Kaufmann's tints admire</br>Blithe Spenser's fancied child.", "But &mdash; when next on Una's face</br>Your pencil's power you try,</br>Let not each feature and each grace</br>Angelica supply:", "But, by a Mirror's faithful aid,</br>With nice attention draw</br>From model of thyself, sweet maid!</br>A form without a flaw.", "At sight of which, tho' no fierce brood</br>(Infringing Nature's laws,)</br>Of Tygers fawn and leave their food,</br>A Lion's roar applause;", "Yet, which from reasonable men</br>Shall admiration claim,</br>And which the pencil and the pen</br>Shall consecrate to fame.</br>"]
