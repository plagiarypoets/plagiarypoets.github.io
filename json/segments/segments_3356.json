["Profuse of her beauties, the May</br>Luxuriant comes dancing along;</br>In purple she dresses the day,</br>And calls up the picturesque song;</br>Bids rise the soft blossoms of snow,</br>Her bounties unbounded we see,</br>From her lap of green verdure below,</br>She strews o'er each bush and each tree.", "On her bosom ambrosial behold</br>The Zephyrs in amorous sport;</br>In her locks of live silver and gold</br>The Graces establish their court.</br>Unfolding her incense, the Earth</br>To her festival pours all her powers,</br>Gives odours most lavishly birth,</br>The soul of innumerous flowers.", "Approaches the mother of Love,</br>The month of unsullied delight;</br>Her hand is the the throne of a dove,</br>Her garland's embroider'd with white.</br>In colours which glow on the view</br>The pallet of Flora is found;</br>Whose garments of sky-brighten'd blue</br>Reflect the magnificent ground.", "How sweetly she presses the plain!</br>In aspect most lovely are seen</br>The daughters of Spring in her train,</br>Rob'd in all the rich dress of the scene.</br>Fertility, bountiful maid!</br>Awak'd by her genial ray,</br>Bursts forth in each bud and each blade,</br>To cheer and enliven her May.", "O let not her empire so bright</br>The mildew pernicious invade,</br>Her bloom and her foliage by blight</br>A waste of distemper be made.</br>Ye powers of Spring then intreat,</br>Apollo your fears shall behold;</br>Establish your May in her seat,</br>Protect her from wind and from cold.", "The Novel of Nature we read;</br>How pleasing her prospects expand!</br>O'er woodland, inclosure, and mead,</br>New beauties emerge from the land.</br>The carols of Spring from the grove</br>Re-echo harmonious notes;</br>'Tis the innocent music of Love,</br>On the bosom of Aether which floats.", "Come, Pales, if pastoral lay</br>Your fancy to transport has led;</br>Panegyrics I sing on the May,</br>Assist me the portrait to spread.</br>Come, Pan, with thy seven-form'd reed,</br>Sylvanus thy neighbour invite;</br>The Muse, in her progress to speed,</br>Enlarge her unpolish'd delight.", "See, Pales herself treads the plain,</br>Her robes of the dew-freshen'd green;</br>Undaunted I utter my strain,</br>So mild and compos'd is her mien.</br>Ye shepherds, your fleece-coated charge</br>Her mandates permit to release;</br>Young bleaters, go ramble at large,</br>Unfolded go wander in peace.", "The maple and plane-tree in bloom</br>Emblazon each sylvan retreat;</br>And Flora purloins from her loom</br>To canopy over each seat.</br>By the side of the park in the vale</br>The hawthorn, young minion of May,</br>Her bosom unfolds to the gale</br>In blossoms exub'rant and gay.", "The pink, many varied of vest,</br>The yellow and white asphodel,</br>And tulip, in pageantry drest,</br>Are emulous each to excel.</br>The rose, royal empress of sweets,</br>In the path of the fashion'd parterre,</br>The suckle and jessamine greets,</br>Sweet maids that her presence revere.", "Deep sunk in the lap of the dale,</br>Of elegance simple the queen,</br>To lavish her sweets of regale,</br>The lily, dawn-bosom'd, is seen.</br>The orchis and fox-glove appear,</br>The hare-bell has crimson'd the shade,</br>Sweet goddess, that paints the young year,</br>Thy pallet each landscape is made.", "Come, Delia, dear Hebe of youth,</br>O come, with thy dark azure eye;</br>How sweet to my heart is thy truth,</br>To the arms of thy Corydon fly.</br>See May, from yon rose-shedding cloud,</br>Restoress of pleasure, descends;</br>Zephyrus awaits on the croud</br>Of Sports which her levee attends.", "Of Sol, the bright daughter, each hour</br>As devious we wander along,</br>Shall smile like a beam on the shower,</br>And Philomel lavish her song.</br>With Innocence fix'd as our guide,</br>Thou sweeter by far than the May,</br>With mutual Consent by our side,</br>Let Flora her rival survey.", "The prais'd renovation enjoy,</br>My fair, with serenity blest,</br>O let not one trouble annoy</br>The halcyon May of thy breast.</br>May pleasure that's virtuous and pure</br>To your heart true felicity bring,</br>Through a series of time to insure</br>In your mind a perpetual spring.", "And now, when the star of the morn</br>Comes dancing, on day-break's first gleam,</br>Shall I pluck from the sloe-bearing thorn,</br>The nest by the side of the stream?</br>Two blackbirds, whose conjugal care</br>I guarded for Delia's dear sake,</br>Have finish'd their tenderness there,</br>The young ones are ready to take.", "Does Pity, dear maid, give you pain,</br>I see her own pearls in your eye;</br>My hand from the deed shall refrain,</br>The younglings be suffer'd to fly.</br>Their parents, as well as the young,</br>In thanks shall their harmony join;</br>I'll hear their soft gratitude sung,</br>Abash'd that the offer was mine.", "'Tis Nature spontaneous, thy smile,</br>With gladness the earth is elate;</br>One carpet of velvet the soil</br>Has spread in superlative state.</br>The plume-painted minstrels of song</br>Commingle their generous lays</br>In notes which to rapture prolong</br>The season's Creator to praise.", "Shall man be deficient in grace?</br>Let Gratitude banish the thought;</br>The hand of Divinity trace,</br>Through May, with munificence fraught.</br>The Muse, Admiration thy friend,</br>Shall join in the pious repast,</br>The knee of Thanksgiving to bend,</br>For mercies both present and past.</br>"]
