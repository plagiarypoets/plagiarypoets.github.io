["To hardship, friend, enure thy son betimes;</br>Send the stout youth with level'd spear to ride</br>At the fierce Parthian foe,</br>And in sharp warfare learn</br>To joust with danger, snatch his sleeps abroad,</br>And bear the narrow dole of penury.</br>Him from the hostile wall</br>With anxious measuring eye</br>The royal mother, or the bride, shall view,</br>Trembling, least he whom their rash wishes shield,</br>When gore-fed anger calls</br>To rend the reeking ranks,</br>Meet the young lion &mdash; tempt the doubtful strife.</br>'Tis sweet and seemly for our land to fall.</br>The flying footstep Death</br>Also attains, nor spares</br>The coward's hamstring, or his branded back.</br>True Fortitude not only braves the fight</br>Undaunted, but the camp;</br>Nor heeds a clamorous crew</br>At punishment and pardon rash alike.</br>To those who merit not the stroke of fate</br>She reachers to unbar</br>The portals of the sky</br>Pointing no common path:  on soaring wing</br>She flies the low-lived feast and wine-sprent floor.</br>Nor unrewarded goes</br>Fidelity's dumb tongue:</br>Hence who the Eleusinian pomp reveals!</br>With him beneath the over-hanging roof</br>I walk not, or abide</br>With him the treacherous keel:</br>Least haply in the dome of evil men</br>A frowning godhead their companions join:</br>Vengeance, tho' lame of foot,</br>Is sure to overtake.</br>But the just man secure his course pursues;</br>Not the fond croud's impetuous zeal for ill,</br>No tyrant's marking frown,</br>His rooted purpose shakes.</br>Him would the storm-vext Adriatic surge,</br>The smould'ring lightning hurl'd by Jove's high hand,</br>The wreck of shattering worlds,</br>Unfearing smite.</br>Thus, Pollux, thus the rover Hercules</br>Strove to attain the beamy seats above,</br>Where in the nectar'd bowl</br>They tinge the rosier lip:</br>Thus, tiger-curbing Bacchus, couldst thou climb</br>The home of Gods &mdash; Quintus thus ascend</br>Borne on the steed of Mars</br>Beyond the flood of earth.</br>"]
