["Dark, sullen power!</br>Whom oft beside some ruined wall I've seen,</br>With stolen step, and clouded mien,</br>Gathering the night-shade's juices pale,</br>When shadows dimmed the moon, and midnight hour</br>Tolled from some steeple nigh!</br>And downy sleep</br>Refused to steep</br>In opiate dews thy ghastly-glaring eye!</br>While at thy elbow stood Despair,</br>Grim-visaged man!  with bristled hair,</br>Shaking aloft his iron flail!</br>And in the blasted vale</br>The raven shrieked with funeral cry,</br>A choral dirge the Furies sung,</br>And while Fate's solemn knell was rung,</br>Thy voice of dreary dole still bade the wretched die.", "Hence away! &mdash; thou fiend forlorn!</br>Nor bid me climb you summit steep,</br>That beetling o'er the fearful deep,</br>Hears the hoarse surge, and the wild tempest borne,</br>In ceaseless turmoil o'er the wintry main,</br>Rush by with hideous sweep!</br>Nor whisper in my startled ear</br>Thy murmured woes, whose accents drear</br>Freeze the warm blood; with dire controul</br>Strike Reason's mintage from the soul,</br>And all it's powers enchain,</br>Till from her anchor Hope reluctant driven,</br>Foregoes her firm support, and quits her hold on heaven.", "Nor yet, where thick-incumbent shadows scowl,</br>Meet me, beside the lonely wood,</br>When night comes lowering on, and the winds howl</br>Among the branches &mdash; rapt in pensive mood,</br>If there, indulging grief, I chance to stray,</br>While stern Adversity's dire ills infest,</br>Or untamed passion boil within my breast,</br>Ah, turn thy steps afar, nor cross my way!</br>Lest of light's cheering ray</br>Bereft, and wildered more, as thy dim form</br>Bids Fancy saddest hues of sorrow bring,</br>While Death, half-seen, amidst the twilight storm</br>Sails by on dusky wing;</br>Aghast, and vanquish'd by thy potent spells,</br>I drop into the gulph where Frenzy dwells!</br>"]
