["Why am I loth to leave this earthly scene?</br>Have I so found it full of pleasing charms?</br>Some drops of joy with draughts of ill between;</br>Some gleams of sunshine mid renewing storms:</br>Is it some departing pangs my soul alarms?</br>Or Death's unlovely, dreary, dark abode?</br>For guilt, for guilt, my terrors are in arms;</br>I tremble to approach an angry GOD,</br>And justly smart beneath his sin-avenging rod.", "Fain would I say, \"Forgive my foul offence!\"</br>Fain promise never more to disobey;</br>But, should my Author health again dispense,</br>Again I might desert fair Virtue's way;</br>Again in folly's path might go astray;</br>Again exalt the brute and sink the man;</br>Then how should I for Heavenly Mercy pray,</br>Who act so counter Heavenly Mercy's plan?</br>Who sin so oft have mourn'd, yet to temptation ran?", "O Thou, Great Governor of all below!</br>If I may dare a lifted eye to Thee,</br>Thy nod can make the tempest cease to blow,</br>Or still the tumult of the raging sea:</br>With that controuling pow'r assist ev'n me,</br>Those headlong, furious passions to confine;</br>For all unfit I feel my powers to be,</br>To rule their torrent in th' allowed line;</br>O, aid me with Thy help, Ominpotence Divine!</br>"]
