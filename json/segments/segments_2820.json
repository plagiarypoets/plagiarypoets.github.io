["When night disappears in the west,</br>How refreshing the breath of the morn!</br>By zephyr's soft pinion embrac'd,</br>How fragrant the dew-spangled thorn!", "How tuneful the nightingale's strain</br>That gladdens the villager's way,</br>While pacing the shadowy plain</br>He leaves ev'ry toil of the day!", "So delightful the numbers that flow</br>From Friendship's affectionate heart:</br>So pleasing her blossoms that blow</br>Spontaneous, and blameless of art.", "O Friendship, behold I presume</br>With my Delon to visit thy fane:</br>Our souls with thy spirit illume;</br>Nor let us invoke thee in vain.", "We will come to thine altar, and bring</br>An off'ring which thou wilt receive,</br>Our hearts:  and thy quirists will sing,</br>\"May they love thee as long as they live.", "\"May they love thee, and feel thee beguile</br>The pains and the terrors of care:</br>And feel how thy lenient smile</br>Assuages the pang of despair!", "\"May thy bold exhortation inspire</br>Their bosoms with manly designs:</br>May they glow with thy generous fire</br>That enlivens, exalts, and refines!", "\"They will love thee, and with thee abide,</br>Thine elect; and thy hold behests</br>Are their law:  and thy truth is their guide:</br>And thy tenderness reigns in their breasts.\"</br>"]
