["Sweet instrument!  which fix'd in yellow teeth</br>So clear, so sprightly, and so gay is found,</br>Whether you breath along the shore of Leith,</br>Or Lowmond's lofty cliffs thy strains resound;</br>Struck by a taper finger's gentle tip,</br>Ah, softly in our ears thy pleasing murmurs slip!", "Where'er thy lively music's found,</br>All are jumping, dancing round:</br>Ev'n trusty William lifts a leg,</br>And capers like sixteen with Meg;</br>Both old and young confess thy powerful sway,</br>They skip like madmen, and then frisk away.", "Rous'd by the magic of the charming air,</br>The yawning dogs forego their heavy slumber;</br>The ladies listen on the narrow stair,</br>And Captain Andrew straight forgets his numbers.</br>Cats and mice give o'er their batt'ling,</br>Pewter plates on shelves are rattling;</br>But falling down, the noise my lady hears,</br>Whose scolding drowns the trump more tuneful than the spheres!</br>"]
