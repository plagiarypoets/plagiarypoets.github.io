["Yes, she was beautiful &mdash; divinely fair:</br>Majestic calmness sat upon her brow</br>Not in dull cold forbiddance, but an air</br>Of kindness mingled with that statelier show;</br>Her star-bright eye beam'd forth a generous glow</br>Beneath the darkling lid &mdash; but yet that light</br>Was mellow as the rays in friendship's bow;</br>Its pupil, sable as the jet of night,</br>Dazzled the gazer though itself serenely bright.</br>"]
