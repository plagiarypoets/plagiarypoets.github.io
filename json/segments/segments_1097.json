["Ah what hard fate attends the living bard,</br>While cold neglect weighs down his soaring muse,</br>Dull Fortune's gifts are by the croud preferr'd</br>To all the poet's more than mortal views.", "Unhappy Spenser, in whose sacred strains</br>Unbounded genius pours her brightest fire:</br>In vain to Gothic peers thy Muse complains,</br>In Sorrow's shade she tunes her lofty lyre.", "Camoens too, proud Lusitania's boast,</br>Felt hard unkindness check the noble song;</br>Tho' daring Gama lives on ev'ry coast,</br>His poet died amongst the needy throng.", "But after-ages yield undying fame,</br>And dwell delighted on their boundless praise;</br>While their oppressors live to scorn and shame,</br>Held forth to vengeance in the Muse's lays,</br>No grateful song embalms their hated name,</br>The Muse they scorn'd no Muse their tombs shall raise.</br>"]
