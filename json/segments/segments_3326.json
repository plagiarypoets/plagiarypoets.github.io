["Ill fares the wretch whom prudence cannot teach,</br>Whose heedless, fond affections led astray,</br>Fix on a fair one far beyond his reach,</br>To pine in hopeless sorrow day by day;</br>Restless each night, he starts but to complain;</br>While each succeeding sun only renews his pain.", "Think'st thou, fond fool, a virgin gaily bred,</br>Will ever deign to spend a thought on thee;</br>Will give up views of splendor, fancy fed,</br>And stoop, for thy sake, to obscurity?</br>Hadst thou reflected thus in proper time,</br>Thou'd'st 'scap'd the grief that flows in this desponding rhime.", "Ah!  what will honest tenderness avail,</br>Without or wealth to grace, or arts to please?</br>Worth greater far than thine would surely fail,</br>Out-bid, out-shone, excell'd, eclips'd by these!</br>'Tis not for thee with rivals to contend,</br>But in some lonely cell thy luckless life to spend.", "Had fortune shower'd those gifts, alas denied!</br>Had rank and honours rais'd thee from the crowd;</br>To lay them at her feet had been thy pride,</br>Thine honour had from her acceptance flow'd;</br>Unhappy man!  see how thy sorrow teems!</br>For consolation driv'n to wild, delusive dreams.", "Though thy sad heart, now deaden'd by despair,</br>It matters little what becomes of thee;</br>May Providence guard with especial care,</br>Th' unconscious auth'ress of thy misery;</br>May ev'ry wish of her's be gratify'd,</br>Heav'ns blessings all her own, and may no ill betide.</br>"]
